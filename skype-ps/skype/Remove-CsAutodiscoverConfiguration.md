# Remove-CsAutodiscoverConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Removes a collection of Autodiscover configuration settings.
The Autodiscover service provides a way for client applications such as Lync Web Access or Microsoft Lync Mobile to locate key resources such as a user's home pool or the URL for joining a dial-in conference.
This cmdlet was introduced in the cumulative update for Lync Server 2010: November 2011.

Removes a collection of Autodiscover configuration settings.

This cmdlet was introduced in the cumulative update for Lync Server 2010: November 2011.



## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsAutodiscoverConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Confirm] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

For client applications to make the most effective use of Lync Server those applications need to know the location of key Lync Server components.
For example, authenticated users must be able to locate their home pool; after all, they can only be authenticated by that home pool.
Likewise, unauthenticated users must be able to do such things as locate the URL used for joining a conference.

If all your users logged on from behind the organization's firewall discovering these locations would be a relatively simple task.
However, this relatively simple task gets more and more complicated as users access the system from external locations using Microsoft Lync Mobile or Lync Web Access.

This is especially true in split-domain scenarios, scenarios in which some of an organization's users have accounts on the on-premises version of Lync Server while other users have accounts on Microsoft Office 365.
In cases such as this, user accounts might be located in different Active Directory forests.
That can pose a problem: for example, if a US-based user logs on from Europe the system must be able to recognize his or her forest and then refer the logon request to the proper pool.

The Autodiscover service was introduced in the cumulative update for Lync Server: November 2011 in order to address these issues.
When a client application attempts to access Lync Server, the Autodiscover service parses the client SIP address and then redirects that request to the appropriate pool.
Client applications connect to the Autodiscover service by sending an HTTP request to an Autodiscover URL; these URLs must be configured by administrators in order for the Autodiscover service to work.
(Note that, in addition to configuring URLs, administrators must also create DNS records that correspond to these URLs.)

Autodiscover URLs are assigned to Autodiscover configuration settings; in turn, these settings can be applied to the global scope or to the site scope.
If you later decide to remove settings assigned to the site scope you can do so by running the Remove-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration cmdlet.
Note that this cmdlet can also be run against the global settings.
In that case, however, the global settings will not be removed; however, any Autodiscover URLs assigned to the global collection will be deleted.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.

This is especially true in split-domain scenarios, scenarios in which some of an organization's users have accounts on the on-premises version of Skype for Business Server 2015 while other users have accounts on Skype for Business Online.
In cases such as this, user accounts might be located in different Active Directory forests.
That can pose a problem: for example, if a US-based user logs on from Europe the system must be able to recognize his or her forest and then refer the logon request to the proper pool.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes the Autodiscover configuration settings for the Redmond site.

Remove-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes the Autodiscover configuration settings for the Redmond site.

Remove-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, all the Autodiscover configurations settings assigned to the site scope are removed.
To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration cmdlet and the Filter parameter to return a collection of configuration settings; the filter value "site:*" ensures that only settings that have an Identity that begins with the string value "site:" are returned.
That filtered collection is then piped to the Remove-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration, which deletes each item in the collection.

Get-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration -Filter "site:*" | Remove-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, all the Autodiscover configurations settings assigned to the site scope are removed.
To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration cmdlet and the Filter parameter to return a collection of configuration settings; the filter value "site:*" ensures that only settings that have an Identity that begins with the string value "site:" are returned.
That filtered collection is then piped to the Remove-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration cmdlet, which deletes each item in the collection.

Get-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration -Filter "site:*" | Remove-CsAutoDiscoverConfiguration

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the Autodiscover settings to be removed.
Autodiscover settings can be configured at the global or the site scope.
To "remove" the global policy, use this syntax: -Identity global.
(Note that the global settings cannot actually be removed.
Instead, all the properties in the global settings will be reset to their default values.)

To remove settings configured at the site scope, use syntax similar to this:

-Identity "site:Redmond"

Note that wildcards are not allowed when specifying an Identity.
