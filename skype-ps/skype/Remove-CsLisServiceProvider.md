## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsLisServiceProvider [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

In an Enterprise Voice implementation with E9-1-1, emergency calls must first be routed through an E9-1-1 Network Routing Provider to ensure that the calls are routed to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).
(A PSAP is the agency in the United States that directs the calls to the nearest emergency services, such as police, fire, and ambulance services.) In order to do this, the provider must have a list of locations from the organization that it can then match against the Master Street Address Guide to ensure all locations are valid.
This cmdlet removes an entry for a provider; after running this cmdlet there will be no web service access to the provider.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsLisServiceProvider cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsLisServiceProvider"}
