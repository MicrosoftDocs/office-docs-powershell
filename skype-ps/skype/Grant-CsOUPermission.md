## SYNTAX

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

If you have locked down your Active Directory domain (that is, if you have disabled permission inheritance) then the domain preparation that takes place when you install Lync Server 2010 will not be able to add the permissions needed to manage users, computers, contacts, application contacts, and InetOrg persons.
(Domain administrators will still be able to manage these objects, but no one else, including members of the RTCUniversalUserAdmins group, will have management permissions.) In that case, you will need to use the Grant-CsOUPermission cmdlet to give the required security groups the required permissions.
This must be done on a container-by-container basis.

Note that this cmdlet only grants permissions to a set of predefined security groups; the cmdlet cannot be used to grant permissions to arbitrary security groups or to individual users.

Permissions granted by using Grant-CsOUPermission can later be removed by using Revoke-CsOUPermission.
If you run that cmdlet, then the groups initially granted the OU permissions will no longer have those Lync Server management permissions for the specified Active Directory container.
In that case, you will need to be an enterprise administrator or a domain administrator in order to manage Lync Server or one of its components.

Who can run this cmdlet: You must be a domain administrator in order to run the Grant-CsOUPermission cmdlet locally.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "Grant-CsOUPermission"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Grant-CsOUPermission -OU "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" -ObjectType "user"
```

The command shown in Example 1 grants user management permissions (-ObjectType "user") to the Redmond OU in the domain litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 grants user management rights (-ObjectType "user") to the Redmond OU in the domain litwareinc.com.

Grant-CsOUPermission -OU "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" -ObjectType "user"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 grants user management rights (-ObjectType "user") to the Redmond OU in the domain litwareinc.com.

Grant-CsOUPermission -OU "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" -ObjectType "user"

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Grant-CsOUPermission -OU "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" -ObjectType "user","contact","inetOrgPerson"
```

In Example 2, management permissions are granted for three different objects (user, contact, inetOrgPerson) for the Redmond OU in the domain litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, management rights are granted for three different objects (user, contact, inetOrgPerson) for the Redmond OU in the domain litwareinc.com.

Grant-CsOUPermission -OU "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" -ObjectType "user","contact","inetOrgPerson"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, management rights are granted for three different objects (user, contact, inetOrgPerson) for the Redmond OU in the domain litwareinc.com.

Grant-CsOUPermission -OU "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" -ObjectType "user","contact","inetOrgPerson"

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
$x = "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com", "ou=Dublin,dc=litwareinc,dc=com", "ou=Tokyo,dc=litwareinc,dc=com"

foreach ($i in $x) {Grant-CsOUPermission -OU $i -ObjectType "user"}
```

In the preceding example, user management permissions are simultaneously granted for three different OUs: Redmond, Dublin, and Tokyo.
To carry out this task, the first command in the example creates an array variable named $x; this variable holds the distinguished names of the three Active Directory OUs where permissions will be granted.
In the second command, a foreach loop is created that takes each OU stored in the array and runs the Grant-CsOUPermission cmdlet against that organizational unit.
In turn, that command grants user management permissions for each OU in the array.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 3, user management rights are simultaneously granted for three different OUs: Redmond, Dublin, and Tokyo.
To carry out this task, the first command in the example creates an array variable named $x; this variable holds the distinguished names of the three Active Directory OUs where rights will be granted.
In the second command, a foreach loop is created that takes each OU stored in the array and runs the Grant-CsOUPermission cmdlet against that organizational unit.
In turn, that command grants user management rights for each OU in the array.

$x = "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com", "ou=Dublin,dc=litwareinc,dc=com", "ou=Tokyo,dc=litwareinc,dc=com"

foreach ($i in $x) {Grant-CsOUPermission -OU $i -ObjectType "user"}

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 3, user management rights are simultaneously granted for three different OUs: Redmond, Dublin, and Tokyo.
To carry out this task, the first command in the example creates an array variable named $x; this variable holds the distinguished names of the three Active Directory OUs where rights will be granted.
In the second command, a foreach loop is created that takes each OU stored in the array and runs the Grant-CsOUPermission cmdlet against that organizational unit.
In turn, that command grants user management rights for each OU in the array.

$x = "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com", "ou=Dublin,dc=litwareinc,dc=com", "ou=Tokyo,dc=litwareinc,dc=com"

foreach ($i in $x) {Grant-CsOUPermission -OU $i -ObjectType "user"}
