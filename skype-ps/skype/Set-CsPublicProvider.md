## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Federation is a means by which two organizations can set up a trust relationship that facilitates communication between the two groups. 
When federation has been established, users in the two organizations can send each other instant messages, subscribe for presence notifications, and otherwise communicate with one another using SIP applications such as Microsoft Lync 2010.
Lync Server 2010 allows for three types of federation: 1) direct federation between your organization and another; 2) federation between your organization and a public provider; and, 3) federation between your organization and a third-party hosting provider.

A public provider is an organization which provides SIP communication services for the general public.
When you establish a federation relationship with a public provider, you effectively establish federation with any user who has an account hosted by that provider.
For example, if you federate with MSN, then (depending on how you have configured your system) your users will be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with anyone who have an MSN instant messaging account.

In order to federate with a public provider you will need to create and enable a new public provider.
(In addition, the public provider will need to create a federation relationship with you.) Lync Server includes three public providers - Yahoo!; AOL; and MSN - that are preconfigured for you.
As additional public providers become available, you can create federation relationships with these new providers by using the New-CsPublicProvider cmdlet.
After federated relationships have been established, you can then use the Set-CsPublicProvider to modify two important property values -- Enabled and VerificationLevel -- of these relationships.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsPublicProvider cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsPublicProvider"}

Federation is a means by which two organizations can set up a trust relationship that facilitates communication between the two groups.
When federation has been established, users in the two organizations can send each other instant messages, subscribe for presence notifications, and otherwise communicate with one another using SIP applications such as Skype for Business.
Skype for Business Server 2015 allows for three types of federation: 1) direct federation between your organization and another; 2) federation between your organization and a public provider; and, 3) federation between your organization and a third-party hosting provider.

A public provider is an organization which provides SIP communication services for the general public.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsPublicProvider -Identity "MSN" -VerificationLevel "UseSourceVerification"
```

The preceding command sets the VerificationLevel for the public provider with the Identity MSN.
This is done by including the VerificationLevel parameter and the parameter value UseSourceVerification.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 1 sets the VerificationLevel for the public provider with the Identity Messenger.
This is done by including the VerificationLevel parameter and the parameter value UseSourceVerification.

Set-CsPublicProvider -Identity "Messenger" -VerificationLevel "UseSourceVerification"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 1 sets the VerificationLevel for the public provider with the Identity Skype.
This is done by including the VerificationLevel parameter and the parameter value AlwaysVerifiable.

Set-CsPublicProvider -Identity "Skype" -VerificationLevel "AlwaysVerifiable"

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsPublicProvider | Set-CsPublicProvider -VerificationLevel "UseSourceVerification"
```

In Example 2, the verification level is modified for all the public providers currently in use in the organization.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsPublicProvider without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the public providers currently configured for use.
This collection is then piped to Set-CsPublicProvider, which takes each provider in the collection and changes the value of the VerificationLevel property to UseSourceVerification.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, the verification level is modified for all the public providers currently in use in the organization.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsPublicProvider without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the public providers currently configured for use.
This collection is then piped to Set-CsPublicProvider, which takes each provider in the collection and changes the value of the VerificationLevel property to UseSourceVerification.

Get-CsPublicProvider | Set-CsPublicProvider -VerificationLevel "UseSourceVerification"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, the verification level is modified for all the public providers currently in use in the organization.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsPublicProvider cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the public providers currently configured for use.
This collection is then piped to the Set-CsPublicProvider cmdlet, which takes each provider in the collection and changes the value of the VerificationLevel property to AlwaysVerifiable.

Get-CsPublicProvider | Set-CsPublicProvider -VerificationLevel "AlwaysVerifiable"

### -------------------------- Example 3 (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsPublicProvider | Where-Object {$_.VerificationLevel -eq "AlwaysVerifiable"} | Set-CsPublicProvider -VerificationLevel "UseSourceVerification"
```

The command shown in Example 3 modifies the verification level for any public provider where that level is currently set to AlwaysVerifiable.
To accomplish this task, the command first calls Get-CsPublicProvider in order to return a collection of all the public providers configured for use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those providers where the VerificationLevel property is equal to AlwaysVerifiable.
In turn, this filtered collection is piped to Set-CsPublicProvider, which changes the VerificationLevel for each provider in the collection to UseSourceVerification.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 3 modifies the verification level for any public provider where that level is currently set to AlwaysVerifiable.
To accomplish this task, the command first calls Get-CsPublicProvider in order to return a collection of all the public providers configured for use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those providers where the VerificationLevel property is equal to AlwaysVerifiable.
In turn, this filtered collection is piped to Set-CsPublicProvider, which changes the VerificationLevel for each provider in the collection to UseSourceVerification.

Get-CsPublicProvider | Where-Object {$_.VerificationLevel -eq "AlwaysVerifiable"} | Set-CsPublicProvider -VerificationLevel "UseSourceVerification"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 3 modifies the verification level for any public provider where that level is currently set to AlwaysUnverifiable.
To accomplish this task, the command first calls the Get-CsPublicProvider cmdlet in order to return a collection of all the public providers configured for use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those providers where the VerificationLevel property is equal to AlwaysUnverifiable.
In turn, this filtered collection is piped to the Set-CsPublicProvider cmdlet, which changes the VerificationLevel for each provider in the collection to AlwaysVerifiable.

Get-CsPublicProvider | Where-Object {$_.VerificationLevel -eq "AlwaysUnverifiable"} | Set-CsPublicProvider -VerificationLevel "AlwaysVerifiable"
