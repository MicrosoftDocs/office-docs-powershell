## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

In Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 and Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2, IIS ran under a standard user account.
This had the potential to cause issues: if that password expired you could lose your Web Services, an issue that was often difficult to diagnose.
To help avoid the issue of expiring passwords, Microsoft Lync Server 2010 enables you to create a computer account (for a computer that doesn't actually exist) that can serve as the authentication principal for all the computers in a site that are running IIS.
Because these accounts use the Kerberos authentication protocol, the accounts are referred to as Kerberos accounts, and the new authentication process is known as Kerberos web authentication.
This enables you to manage all your IIS servers by using a single account.

To run your servers under this new authentication principal, you must first create a computer account by using the New-CsKerberosAccount cmdlet; this account is then assigned to one or more sites.
After the assignment has been made, the association between the account and the Lync Server 2010 site is enabled by running the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet.
Among other things, this creates the required service principal name (SPN) in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
SPNs provide a way for client applications to locate a particular service.

The Set-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet enables you to change the Kerberos account assigned to a given site.
This cmdlet is used for sites that are already associated with an account.
To assign an account to a site that currently is not associated with a Kerberos account, use the New-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet instead.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsKerberosAccountAssignment"}

In Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 and Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2, IIS ran under a standard user account.
This had the potential to cause issues: if that password expired you could lose your Web Services, an issue that was often difficult to diagnose.
To help avoid the issue of expiring passwords, Skype for Business Server 2015 enables you to create a computer account (for a computer that doesn't actually exist) that can serve as the authentication principal for all the computers in a site that are running IIS.
Because these accounts use the Kerberos authentication protocol, the accounts are referred to as Kerberos accounts, and the new authentication process is known as Kerberos web authentication.

To run your servers under this new authentication principal, you must first create a computer account by using the New-CsKerberosAccount cmdlet; this account is then assigned to one or more sites.
After the assignment has been made, the association between the account and the Skype for Business Server 2015 site is enabled by running the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet.
Among other things, this creates the required service principal name (SPN) in Active Directory Domain Services.
SPNs provide a way for client applications to locate a particular service.

The Set-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet enables you to change the Kerberos account assigned to a given site.
This cmdlet is used for sites that are already associated with an account.
To assign an account to a site that currently is not associated with a Kerberos account, use the New-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet instead.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsKerberosAccountAssignment -UserAccount "litwareinc\keberostest" -Identity "site:Redmond"
Enable-CsTopology
```

The commands shown in Example 1 associate an existing Kerberos account (litwareinc\keberostest) with the Redmond site, then use Enable-CsTopology to enable the new association.
To do this, the first command in the example uses Set-CsKerberosAccountAssignment to associate the account litwareinc\keberostest with the Redmond site; the second command then calls Enable-CsTopology in order to create the required service principal name in Active Directory and to enable the modified account assignment.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The commands shown in Example 1 associate an existing Kerberos account (litwareinc\keberostest) with the Redmond site, then use Enable-CsTopology to enable the new association.
To do this, the first command in the example uses Set-CsKerberosAccountAssignment to associate the account litwareinc\keberostest with the Redmond site; the second command then calls Enable-CsTopology in order to create the required service principal name in Active Directory and to enable the modified account assignment.

Set-CsKerberosAccountAssignment -UserAccount "litwareinc\keberostest" -Identity "site:Redmond"

Enable-CsTopology

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The commands shown in Example 1 associate an existing Kerberos account (litwareinc\keberostest) with the Redmond site, then use the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet to enable the new association.
To do this, the first command in the example uses the Set-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet to associate the account litwareinc\keberostest with the Redmond site; the second command then calls the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet in order to create the required service principal name in Active Directory and to enable the modified account assignment.

Set-CsKerberosAccountAssignment -UserAccount "litwareinc\keberostest" -Identity "site:Redmond"

Enable-CsTopology
