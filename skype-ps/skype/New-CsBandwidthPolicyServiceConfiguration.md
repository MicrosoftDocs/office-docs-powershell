**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Creates a new bandwidth policy service configuration.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
New-CsBandwidthPolicyServiceConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-EnableLogging <Boolean>]
 [-LogCleanUpInterval <TimeSpan>] [-MaxLogFileSizeMb <UInt32>] [-MaxTokenLifetime <TimeSpan>] [-Force]
 [-InMemory] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Call admission control (CAC) is a way of determining whether to allow real-time communications sessions, such as voice or video calls, to be established based on bandwidth constraints.
Within the Microsoft Lync Server 2010 implementation of CAC, regions, sites, and subnets are defined within a network along with the relationships and links between those entities in order to place bandwidth constraints between them.
Bandwidth Policy service is the component that performs CAC functionality in the Lync Server 2010 deployment, enabling the decision as to whether sufficient bandwidth exists for a call to be established.
This cmdlet configures a new bandwidth policy service at the site level.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsBandwidthPolicyServiceConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsBandwidthPolicyServiceConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsBandwidthPolicyServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond
```

This example creates a new bandwidth policy service configuration at the site Redmond (-Identity site:Redmond).
No other parameters are specified, so the defaults are used for all configuration values.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example creates a new bandwidth policy service configuration at the site Redmond (-Identity site:Redmond).
No other parameters are specified, so the defaults are used for all configuration values.

New-CsBandwidthPolicyServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example creates a new bandwidth policy service configuration at the site Redmond (-Identity site:Redmond).
No other parameters are specified, so the defaults are used for all configuration values.

New-CsBandwidthPolicyServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsBandwidthPolicyServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Dublin -EnableLogging $True -LogCleanupInterval 30.00:00:00
```

In this example we again create a new bandwidth policy service configuration, this time for the Dublin site (-Identity site:Dublin).
For this site, rather than accepting the default values, we want to enable logging and set the number of days that pass before logs are cleaned up to 30 days.
We do this by passing a value of True ($True) to the EnableLogging parameter, and then passing a value of 30.00:00:00 to the parameter LogCleanupInterval.
The LogCleanupInterval value is a TimeSpan object, which is in the format dd.hh:mm:ss, where d is days, h is hours, m is minutes, and s is seconds.
