## SYNTAX

```
Start-CsClsLogging -Scenario <String> [-AsXml] [-Computers <String[]>] [-Duration <String>] [-Pools <String[]>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The centralized logging service (which replaces the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides a way for administrators to manage logging and tracing for all computers and pools running Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview.
Centralized logging enables administrators to stop, start, and configure logging for one or more pools and computers by using a single command; for example, you can use one command to enable Address Book service logging on all your Address Book servers.
This differs from the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools, which had to be individually managed (including individually stopped and started) on each server.
In addition, the centralized logging service also provides a way for administrators to search trace logs from the command, using Windows PowerShell and the Search-CsClsLogging cmdlet.

Centralized logging is built around a series of predefined scenarios that offer a more finely-targeted approach to logging than offered in previous versions of Lync Server.
These scenarios predetermine the server components and logging for you; as a result, an administrator enabling the RGS scenario can be confident that he or she will only log information relevant to the Response Group service and not to, say, the audio conferencing provider service.

It is also possible to define custom scenarios by using the New-CsClsScenario cmdlet.

The Start-CsClsLogging cmdlet provides a way for administrators to begin logging a specified scenario on a computer or set of computers.
By default, that logging operation will continue to run until the Duration time limit has expired.
However, administrators can manually stop a logging operation at any time by using the Stop-CsClsLogging cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 1 starts logging the AlwaysOn scenario on all the computers in the current topology.

Start-CsClsLogging -Scenario "AlwaysOn"

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 1 starts logging the AlwaysOn scenario on all the computers in the current topology.

Start-CsClsLogging -Scenario "AlwaysOn"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 starts CPS logging on all the computers in the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com with duration of 12 hours.

Start-CsClsLogging -Scenario "cps" -Pools "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Duration 12:0

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 starts CPS logging on all the computers in the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com with duration of 12 hours.

Start-CsClsLogging -Scenario "cps" -Pools "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Duration 12:0

## PARAMETERS

### -Scenario
Name of the centralized logging scenario to be started.
Available scenarios (and their names) names can be returned by using this command:

Get-CsClsScenario | Select-Object Name

Note that you can only specify one scenario per call to the Start-CsClsLogging cmdlet.
. Also only one scenario other than the "AlwaysOn" scenario can be started on a computer at any one time.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AsXml
When specified, information is returned using XML.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

```

### -Computers
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Enables administrators to start logging on a specified server or set of servers.
To start logging on a single server, specify the fully qualified domain name of that server.
For example:

-Computers "atl-server-001.litwareinc.com"

Multiple servers can be specified by separating the computer FQDNs using commas:

-Computers "atl-server-001.litwareinc.com","red-server-002.litwareinc.com"

If you do not include the Computers parameter or the Pools parameter, Start-CsClsLogging will automatically run against all the computers in the topology.
