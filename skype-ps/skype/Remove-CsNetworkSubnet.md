# Remove-CsNetworkSubnet

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Removes an existing network subnet.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Removes an existing network subnet.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsNetworkSubnet [-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

Each subnet must be associated with a network site for the purposes of determining the geographic location of the host belonging to this subnet.
Use this cmdlet to remove a network subnet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsNetworkSubnet"}

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Each subnet must be associated with a network site for the purposes of determining the geographic location of the host belonging to this subnet.
Use this cmdlet to remove a network subnet.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Remove-CsNetworkSubnet -Identity 172.11.15.0
```

This example removes the subnet with the Identity (the Subnet ID) 172.11.15.0.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example removes the subnet with the Identity (the Subnet ID) 172.11.15.0.

Remove-CsNetworkSubnet -Identity 172.11.15.0

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example removes the subnet with the Identity (the Subnet ID) 172.11.15.0.

Remove-CsNetworkSubnet -Identity 172.11.15.0

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsNetworkSubnet | Where-Object {$_.NetworkSiteID -eq "Vancouver"} | Remove-CsNetworkSubnet
```

Example 2 removes all subnets associated with the Vancouver site.
To do this, we begin by calling the Get-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet.
This will retrieve a collection of all subnets defined within the Microsoft Lync Server 2010 deployment.
This collection of subnets is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
Where-Object takes that collection and narrows it down to only those subnets with a NetworkSiteID equal to (-eq) Vancouver.
Now that the collection consists only of subnets associated with the Vancouver site, we pipe the collection to Remove-CsNetworkSubnet, which removes every item in the collection.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 removes all subnets associated with the Vancouver site.
To do this, we begin by calling the Get-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet.
This will retrieve a collection of all subnets defined within the Lync Server deployment.
This collection of subnets is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
Where-Object takes that collection and narrows it down to only those subnets with a NetworkSiteID equal to (-eq) Vancouver.
Now that the collection consists only of subnets associated with the Vancouver site, we pipe the collection to Remove-CsNetworkSubnet, which removes every item in the collection.

Get-CsNetworkSubnet | Where-Object {$_.NetworkSiteID -eq "Vancouver"} | Remove-CsNetworkSubnet

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 removes all subnets associated with the Vancouver site.
To do this, we begin by calling the Get-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet.
This will retrieve a collection of all subnets defined within the Skype for Business Server 2015 deployment.
This collection of subnets is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
The Where-Object cmdlet takes that collection and narrows it down to only those subnets with a NetworkSiteID equal to (-eq) Vancouver.
Now that the collection consists only of subnets associated with the Vancouver site, we pipe the collection to the Remove-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet, which removes every item in the collection.

Get-CsNetworkSubnet | Where-Object {$_.NetworkSiteID -eq "Vancouver"} | Remove-CsNetworkSubnet
