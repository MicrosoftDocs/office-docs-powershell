Modifies a list of voice test configurations.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Modifies a list of voice test configurations.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Set-CsVoiceConfiguration [[-Identity] <XdsIdentity>] [-VoiceTestConfigurations <PSListModifier>] [-Force]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Instance
```
Set-CsVoiceConfiguration [-Instance <PSObject>] [-VoiceTestConfigurations <PSListModifier>] [-Force] [-WhatIf]

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Voice test configurations are used to test a phone number against a specific voice policy, route, and dial plan.
This cmdlet can be used to modify voice test configurations from a list containing all the voice test configurations for a Microsoft Lync Server 2010 deployment.

This cmdlet modifies an object of type VoiceConfiguration.
This object is simply a container object for voice test configurations.
Therefore, the use of this cmdlet is not recommended.
To modify voice configurations, modify the individual voice test configurations by calling the Set-CsVoiceTestConfiguration cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsVoiceConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsVoiceConfiguration"}

Voice test configurations are used to test a phone number against a specific voice policy, route, and dial plan.
This cmdlet can be used to modify voice test configurations from a list containing all the voice test configurations for a Skype for Business Server 2015 deployment.

This cmdlet modifies an object of type VoiceConfiguration.
This object is simply a container object for voice test configurations.
Therefore, the use of this cmdlet is not recommended.
To modify voice configurations, modify the individual voice test configurations by calling the Set-CsVoiceTestConfiguration cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsVoiceConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
$a = Get-CsVoiceConfiguration
$b = $a.VoiceTestConfigurations | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "TestConfig2"}
$b.DialedNumber = 5551212
$b.ExpectedTranslatedNumber = +5551212
Set-CsVoiceConfiguration -Instance $a
```

It takes several steps to modify a test voice configuration within a voice configuration.
In this example, we start by retrieving the voice configuration object by calling Get-CsVoiceConfiguration.
We assign the object retrieved (there will be only one) to the variable $a.

In line 2 of this example we retrieve the contents of the VoiceTestConfigurations property, which is a collection of voice test configuration objects, from variable $a.
We then pipe that collection to the Where-Object cmdlet, where we search the collection for the voice test configuration object with a Name equal to the string TestConfig2.
We assign that object to the variable $b.

Next, we modify the TestConfig2 voice test configuration object by assigning new values to the properties DialedNumber and ExpectedTranslatedNumber.
By updating that object we've updated the object in variable $a.
However, that object is still only in memory.
As a final step, we need to save those changes by passing $a to the Instance parameter of Set-CsVoiceConfiguration.

This is not the recommended way of modifying a voice configuration.
To modify a voice configuration, simply change the individual voice test configurations with the Set-CsVoiceTestConfiguration property, as shown here:

Set-CsVoiceTestConfiguration -Identity TestConfig2 -DialedNumber 5551212 -ExpectedTranslatedNumber +5551212

That one line will accomplish the same task shown in Example 1.
