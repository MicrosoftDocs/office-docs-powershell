## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsServerApplication -Identity "EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor" -Uri http://www.litwareinc.com/edgemonitor -Critical $False
```

Example 1 creates a new server application with the Identity EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor.
In addition to specifying the Identity, the parameters Uri and Critical are included; these parameters are used to specify the application URI and to indicate the application is not considered critical.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 1 creates a new server application with the Identity EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor.
In addition to specifying the Identity, the parameters Uri and Critical are included; these parameters are used to specify the application URI and to indicate the application is not considered critical.

New-CsServerApplication -Identity "EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor" -Uri http://www.litwareinc.com/edgemonitor -Critical $False

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 1 creates a new server application with the Identity EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor.
In addition to specifying the Identity, the parameters Uri and Critical are included; these parameters are used to specify the application URI and to indicate the application is not considered critical.

New-CsServerApplication -Identity "EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor" -Uri http://www.litwareinc.com/edgemonitor -Critical $False

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
$x = New-CsServerApplication -Identity "EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor" -InMemory
$x.Uri = "http://www.litwareinc.com/edgemonitor"
$x.Critical = $False
Set-CsServerApplication -Instance $x
```

The commands shown in Example 2 demonstrate how you can create a new server application that initially exists only in memory.
To do this, the first command calls New-CsServerApplication along with two parameters: Identity (which specifies the Identity for the application) and InMemory, which indicates that the new application should be created in memory only.
The resulting server application object is then stored in the variable $x.

After this virtual server application has been created, commands 2 and 3 are used to modify the values of the Uri and Critical properties, respectively.
Finally, command 4 is used to transform the virtual server application into an actual server application.
Note that this final command is mandatory.
If you do not call Set-CsServerApplication, no application will be configured for EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor, and the virtual application will disappear as soon as you end your Windows PowerShell session or delete the variable $x.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the server application to be created.
Server application Identities are composed of the service where the application is hosted plus the application name.
For example, the server application named QoEAgent might have an Identity similar to this: service:Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/QoEAgent.

```yaml
Type: XdsIdentity
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Parent
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

Specifies the service that will host the new server application.
If you use the Identity parameter, then you do not need to use either the Parent or the Name parameters; that's because the application Identity combines the values of the Parent and Name properties.
However, you can omit the Identity parameter by using the Parent and Name parameters instead.
In that case, the Parent parameter would need to look something like this: -Parent "Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com".



**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Specifies the service that will host the new server application.
If you use the Identity parameter, then you do not need to use either the Parent or the Name parameters; that's because the application Identity combines the values of the Parent and Name properties.
However, you can omit the Identity parameter by using the Parent and Name parameters instead.
In that case, the Parent parameter would need to look something like this:

-Parent "Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"



```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ParentAndRelativeKey
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Friendly name for the service.
If you use the Identity parameter you do not need to include the Name parameter when creating a new service; instead, the Name property will be populated using the name portion of the application Identity.
For example, if you create a new application with the Identity service:Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/TestService the application will automatically be named TestService.
The Name parameter is required only if you use the Parent parameter.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ParentAndRelativeKey
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Uri
Unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for the application.
For example, the QoEAgent application has the URI http://www.microsoft.com/LCS/QoEAgent.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Enabled
Set this value to True to enable the application.
Set the value to False to disable the application.
If this parameter is not specified the Enabled property will be set to False and the new application will be disabled.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Critical
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

If set to True, then Lync Server will not start unless the application in question can be started.
If False, then Lync Server will start regardless of whether or not the application can be started.
If this parameter is not specified the Critical property will be set to True.



**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

If set to True, then Skype for Business Server 2015 will not start unless the application in question can be started.
If False, then Skype for Business Server 2015 will start regardless of whether or not the application can be started.
If this parameter is not specified the Critical property will be set to True.



```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ScriptName
Path to the Microsoft SIP Processing Language (MSPL) script used by the application (if applicable).
MSPL is a scripting language used for filtering and routing SIP messages.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Priority
Indicates the order of execution for server applications.
The application with priority 0 is started first; the application with priority 1 is started second; and so on.
Note that each service that hosts a server application has its own unique set of priorities.
For example, the Registrar service might host three applications with corresponding priorities 0, 1, and 2.
Similarly, the Edge Server service might have four applications; these applications will have the priorities 0, 1, 2, and 3.

If you do not specify a priority then the application will automatically be added to the bottom of the priority list.
If you add or remove an application the priorities of the other applications will be adjusted accordingly.
For example, if you delete an application that has a priority of 0 then the application that previously had the priority 1 will automatically have its priority set to 0.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015
