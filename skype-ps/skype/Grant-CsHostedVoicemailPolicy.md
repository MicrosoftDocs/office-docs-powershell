## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

This cmdlet assigns an existing user-specific hosted voice mail policy to a user.
A hosted voice mail policy specifies how to route unanswered calls to a user to a hosted Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) service.

You can check whether a user has been granted a per-user hosted voice mail policy by calling a command in this format: Get-CsUser "\<user name\>" | Select-Object HostedVoicemailPolicy.
For example:

Get-CsUser "Ken Myer" | Select-Object HostedVoicemailPolicy

If you assign to a user a hosted voice mail policy that does not include a destination, you cannot enable that user for hosted voice mail.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Grant-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Grant-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy"}

### -Identity
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

The Identity (unique identifier) of the user to whom the hosted voice mail policy is being assigned.

User identities can be specified using one of four formats: 1) The user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (for example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).

Note that you can use the asterisk (*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
For example, the Identity "* Smith" would return all the users with the last name Smith.
