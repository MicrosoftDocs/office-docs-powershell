## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Many Lync Server 2010 components run as standard Windows services; for example, the Conferencing Attendant application is actually a service named RTCCAA.
If you need to stop a Lync Server service, you can do so by using the Stop-CsWindowsService cmdlet.

Keep in mind that Stop-CsWindowsService can only stop Lync Server services; an error will occur if you attempt to stop a non-Lync Server service (such as the print spooler) using this cmdlet.

Functionally, Stop-CsWindowsService is very similar to the generic Windows PowerShell cmdlet Stop-Service; if you want, you could use Stop-Service to stop a Lync Server service.
However, Stop-CsWindowsService includes a ComputerName parameter that makes it easy to stop a service on a remote computer: you simply include the ComputerName parameter followed by the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the remote computer.
The Stop-Service cmdlet does not have a comparable parameter.
In addition, Stop-CsWindowsService has a Report parameter that enables you to keep a log of any errors that might occur when calling Stop-CsWindowsService.

Stop-CsWindowsService does exactly what the name implies: it stops any service you ask it to stop.
This includes services that have dependent services (services that can only run if the service you are attempting to stop is running).
By default, if you try to stop a service that has dependent services, Stop-CsWindowsService will not only stop the service in question, but will stop all those dependent services as well.
Because that could result in unexpected consequences, you can include the Graceful parameter when calling Stop-CsWindowsService.
When you include the Graceful parameter, Stop-CsWindowsService will the service from accepting any new requests.
All existing service requests will remain as is; however, new requests will be rejected.
As existing requests finish, those requests will not be replaced.
Eventually, all the existing requests will be filled and the service will then shut down.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Stop-CsWindowsService cmdlet locally: RTCUniversaServerAdmins.
In addition, you must also have local administrator rights on the destination computer in order to run this cmdlet.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Stop-CsWindowsService"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Stop-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS"
```

The command shown in Example 1 stops the Response Group application service on the local computer.
The Response Group application service is identified by including the Name parameter and the name of that service: RTCRGS.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 stops the Response Group application service on the local computer.
The Response Group application service is identified by including the Name parameter and the name of that service: RTCRGS.

Stop-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 stops the Response Group application service on the local computer.
The Response Group application service is identified by including the Name parameter and the name of that service: RTCRGS.

Stop-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS"

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Stop-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS" -ComputerName atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
```

Example 2 also stops the Response Group application service; in this example, however, that service is located on the remote computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To stop a service on a remote computer, include the ComputerName parameter followed by the FQDN of the remote computer.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 also stops the Response Group application service; in this example, however, that service is located on the remote computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To stop a service on a remote computer, include the ComputerName parameter followed by the FQDN of the remote computer.

Stop-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS" -ComputerName atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 also stops the Response Group application service; in this example, however, that service is located on the remote computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*Call Park*"} | Stop-CsWindowsService
```

Example 3 demonstrates how you can stop a service even if you do not know the service name (in this example, RTCCPS).
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsWindowsService without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the Lync Server services on the local computer.
This complete collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those services where the DisplayName property includes the string value "Call Park".
The filtered collection is then piped to Stop-CsWindowsService, which stops the Call Park application service.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 demonstrates how you can stop a service even if you do not know the service name (in this example, RTCCPS).
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsWindowsService without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the Lync Server services on the local computer.
This complete collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those services where the DisplayName property includes the string value "Call Park".
The filtered collection is then piped to Stop-CsWindowsService, which stops the Call Park application service.

Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*Call Park*"} | Stop-CsWindowsService

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)

The filtered collection is then piped to the Stop-CsWindowsService cmdlet, which stops the Call Park application service.

Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*Call Park*"} | Stop-CsWindowsService
