## SYNTAX

```
Test-CsPhoneBootstrap [[-TargetFqdn] <String>] -PhoneOrExt <String> -PIN <String> [-RegistrarPort <Int32>]

 [-OutLoggerVariable <String>] -PhoneOrExtension <String> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

In order to connect to Lync Server 2010, Lync 2010 Phone Edition-compatible devices need to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to retrieve the address of a Lync Server Registrar; these devices must also provide a valid phone number and associated personal identification number (PIN) in order to be authenticated by the system.
(This process is known as "bootstrapping".) The Test-CsPhoneBootstrap cmdlet enables administrators to verify that a given user -- using the phone number and PIN assigned to him or her -- is able to log on to the system from a Lync 2010 Phone Edition-compatible device.
(No device is actually needed in order to run the test.)

In order for Test-CsPhoneBootstrap to make its check, the Registrar pool that hosts the user account being tested must be discoverable using DHCP.
To determine whether a Registrar is discoverable in this manner, use the cmdlet Get-CsRegistrarConfiguration and check the value of the EnableDHCPServer property.
If this property is set to False, you will need to use Set-CsRegistrarConfiguration to set the property value to True and make the Registrar discoverable using DHCP.
This can also be done by using Enterprise DHCP Server and configuring the Lync Server-specific options.

Who can run this cmdlet: To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Test-CsPhoneBootstrap"}

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

In order to connect to Skype for Business Server 2015, Phone Edition-compatible devices need to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to retrieve the address of a Skype for Business Server 2015 Registrar; these devices must also provide a valid phone number and associated personal identification number (PIN) in order to be authenticated by the system.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Test-CsPhoneBootstrap -PhoneOrExt "+14255551219" -Pin "0712"
```

The command shown in Example 1 verifies that the user with the specified phone number and PIN can connect to Lync Server using a Lync 2010 Phone Edition-compatible device.
In order to run the test, the user's phone number (+14255551219) and the user's PIN (0712) must be supplied.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 verifies that the user with the specified phone number and PIN can connect to Lync Server using a Lync Phone Edition-compatible device.
In order to run the test, the user's phone number (+14255551219) and the user's PIN (0712) must be supplied.

Test-CsPhoneBootstrap -PhoneOrExt "+14255551219" -Pin "0712"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 verifies that the user with the specified phone number and PIN can connect to Skype for Business Server 2015 using a Phone Edition-compatible device.
