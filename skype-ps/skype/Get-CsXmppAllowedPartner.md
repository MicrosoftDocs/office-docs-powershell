## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a standard communications protocol (based on XML) used for sending messages across the Internet.
XMPP was originally named Jabber, and is supported by a number of Internet messaging and communication applications, including Google Talk and Facebook Chat.

In order for your users to be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with users on an XMPP network, that network must be configured as an XMPP allowed partner.
(You must also assign your users an external access policy that allows XMPP access.) By design, your users will be allowed to communicate with users on any XMPP network that is listed on the allowed partners list.
If you do not want users communicating with users from a given network then you must delete that network from the allowed partners list.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Get-CsXmppAllowedPartner"}

Lync Server Control Panel: To view information about your XMPP allowed partners in the Lync Server Control Panel, click External User Access and then click XMPP Federated Partners.

Get-CsXmppAllowedPartner -Identity "xmpp.contoso.com"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, information is returned for a single XMPP allowed partner: the partner with the Identity xmpp.contoso.com.

Get-CsXmppAllowedPartner -Identity "xmpp.contoso.com"

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 returns information for all the XMPP allowed partners that have an Identity that ends in the string value ".org" (for example, xmpp.contoso.org and xmpp.fabrikam.org).
