This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013 Preview.

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Online

Use the Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy cmdlet to assign a per-user voice routing policy to one or more users.
In Skype for Business Online, voice routing policies are used to determine if users can make international calls as well as taking advantage of the other Enterprise Voice capabilities available in an on-premises installation of Skype for Business Server 2015.

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Voice routing policies are used in "hybrid" scenarios: when some of your users are homed on the on-premises version of Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview and other users are homed on the Office 365 version of Lync Server.
Assigning your Office 365 users a voice routing policy enables those users to receive and to place phones calls to the public switched telephone network by using your on-premises SIP trunks.

Note that simply assigning a user a voice routing policy will not enable them to make PSTN calls via Office 365.
Among other things, you will also need to enable those users for Enterprise Voice and will need to assign them an appropriate voice policy and dial plan.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy"}

Lync Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy cmdlet are not available in the Lync Server Control Panel.

Voice routing policies are used in "hybrid" scenarios: when some of your users are homed on the on-premises version of Skype for Business Server 2015 and other users are homed on Skype for Business Online.
Assigning your Skype for Business Online users a voice routing policy enables those users to receive and to place phones calls to the public switched telephone network by using your on-premises SIP trunks.

Skype for Business Online supports two predefined routing policies.
One allows international calls and the other doesn't.
They are named respectively InternationalCallsAllowed, and InternationalCallsDisallowed.
Granting one of these policies to a user will either allow or disallow international calling for that user.

Simply assigning a user a voice routing policy will not enable them to make PSTN calls via Skype for Business Online.
Among other things, you will also need to enable those users for Enterprise Voice and will need to assign them an appropriate voice policy and dial plan.

The functions carried out by the Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel or the Skype for Business Online admin center.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 assigns the per-user voice routing policy RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy to the user with the Active Directory display name "Ken Myer".

Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy"

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Online)
```

```

This example assigns the per-user voice routing policy "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" to the user with the Active Directory display name "Ken Myer".

Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy"

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 assigns the per-user voice routing policy RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy to the user with the Active Directory display name "Ken Myer".

Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, any per-user voice routing policy previously assigned to the user Ken Myer is unassigned from that user; as a result, Ken Myer will be managed by the global voice routing policy.
To unassign a per-user policy, set the PolicyName to a null value ($Null).

Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName $Null

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Online)
```

```

This example removes any per-user voice routing policy previously assigned to the user Ken Myer.
Ken Myer will be managed by the global voice routing policy.
To unassign a per-user policy, set the PolicyName parameter to null ($Null).

Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName $Null

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, any per-user voice routing policy previously assigned to the user Ken Myer is unassigned from that user; as a result, Ken Myer will be managed by the global voice routing policy.
To unassign a per-user policy, set the PolicyName to a null value ($Null).

Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName $Null

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 assigns the per-user voice routing policy RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy to all the users in the Redmond OU in Active Directory.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsUser along with the OU parameter; the parameter value "OU=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" limits the returned data to user accounts in the Redmond OU.
Those user accounts are then piped to the Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy cmdlet, which assigns each user the voice routing policy RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy.

Get-CsUser -OU "OU=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -PolicyName "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy"

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Online)
```

```

This example assigns the per-user voice routing policy "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" to all the users in the Redmond OU in Active Directory.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsUser cmdlet long with the OU parameter; the parameter value "OU=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" limits the returned data to user accounts in the Redmond OU.
Those user accounts are then piped to the Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy cmdlet, which assigns each user the voice routing policy RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy.

Get-CsUser -OU "OU=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -PolicyName "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy"

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 3 assigns the per-user voice routing policy RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy to all the users in the Redmond OU in Active Directory.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsUser cmdlet long with the OU parameter; the parameter value "OU=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" limits the returned data to user accounts in the Redmond OU.
Those user accounts are then piped to the Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy cmdlet, which assigns each user the voice routing policy RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy.

Get-CsUser -OU "OU=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Grant-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -PolicyName "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy"

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Indicates the Identity of the user account to be assigned the per-user voice routing policy.
User Identities are typically specified using one of four formats: 1) the user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (four example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).

User Identities can also be specified by using the user's Active Directory distinguished name.

In addition, you can use the asterisk (*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
For example, the Identity "* Smith" returns all the users who have a display name that ends with the string value " Smith".
