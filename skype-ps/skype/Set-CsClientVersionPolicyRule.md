## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Client version rules are used to determine which client applications are allowed to log on to Microsoft Lync Server 2010.
When a user attempts to log on to Lync Server 2010, his or her client application sends a SIP header to the server; this header includes detailed information about the application itself, including the software's major version, minor version, and build number.
The version information is then checked against a collection of client version rules to see if any rules apply to that particular application.
For example, suppose a user attempts to log on by using Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2.
Before the user can log on to Lync Server 2010, the system will check to see if there is a client version rule that applies to Office Communicator 2007 R2.
If a rule exists, Lync Server 2010 will then take the action specified by the rule.
That action must be one of the following:

Allow.
The user will be allowed to log on.

AllowAndUpgrade.
The user will be allowed to log on, and his or her copy of Communicator 2007 R2 will automatically be upgraded to the latest version of Lync.
Upgrades are carried out using either Microsoft Update or Windows Server Update Services, depending on how you have configured your system.

AllowWithUrl.
The user will be allowed to log on, and a message will be displayed pointing the user to a URL where the latest version of Lync can be downloaded and installed.
The URL must point to a website that you have created yourself; no such site is created for you when you install Lync Server.

Block.
The user will not be allowed to log on.

BlockAndUpgrade.
The user will not be allowed to log on, but his or her copy of Communicator 2007 R2 will automatically be upgraded to the latest version of Lync.
The user can then try to log on by using the new client application.
Upgrades are carried out using either Microsoft Update or Windows Server Update Services, depending on how you have configured your system.

BlockWithUrl.
The user will not be allowed to log on, but a message will be displayed pointing him or her to a URL where the latest version of Lync can be downloaded and installed.
The URL must point to a website that you have created yourself; no such site is created for you when you install Lync Server.

Client version rules are collected in client version policies; these policies that can be configured at the global scope, the site scope, the service scope (Registrar service), or the per-user scope.
The Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule cmdlet provides a way for you to modify the properties of an existing client version rule.

It's important to note that client version policies do not apply to federated users; instead, federated users are bound by the client version policies used in their own organization.
For example, suppose a federated user uses client A, a client allowed by the federated organization.
As long as the federated organization allows the use of client A, this user will be able to communicate with your organization using that client.
This will be true even if your client version policy blocks the use of client A.
Client version policies enforced in your organization do not override the client version policies used in a federated organization.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Identity site:Redmond/74ba9211-8610-42f9-91ba-846cdee98820 -Enabled $False
```

The command shown in Example 1 disables the client version policy rule that has the Identity site:Redmond/74ba9211-8610-42f9-91ba-846cdee98820.
To disable the rule, the command includes the Enabled parameter and the parameter value $False.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 disables the client version policy rule that has the Identity site:Redmond/74ba9211-8610-42f9-91ba-846cdee98820.
To disable the rule, the command includes the Enabled parameter and the parameter value $False.

Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Identity site:Redmond/74ba9211-8610-42f9-91ba-846cdee98820 -Enabled $False

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 disables the client version policy rule that has the Identity site:Redmond/74ba9211-8610-42f9-91ba-846cdee98820.
To disable the rule, the command includes the Enabled parameter and the parameter value $False.

Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Identity site:Redmond/74ba9211-8610-42f9-91ba-846cdee98820 -Enabled $False

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Filter "site:Redmond*" | Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Description "Client policy rules for Redmond"
G
```

Example 2 adds a generic description to all the client version policy rules assigned to the Redmond site.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "site:Redmond*" limits the returned data to policy rules assigned to the Redmond site.
This collection is then piped to the Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule cmdlet, which assigns the Description "Client policy rules for Redmond" to each item in that collection.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 adds a generic description to all the client version policy rules assigned to the Redmond site.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "site:Redmond*" limits the returned data to policy rules assigned to the Redmond site.
This collection is then piped to the Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule cmdlet, which assigns the Description "Client policy rules for Redmond" to each item in that collection.

Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Filter "site:Redmond*" | Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Description "Client policy rules for Redmond"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 adds a generic description to all the client version policy rules assigned to the Redmond site.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule cmdlet along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "site:Redmond*" limits the returned data to policy rules assigned to the Redmond site.
This collection is then piped to the Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule cmdlet, which assigns the Description "Client policy rules for Redmond" to each item in that collection.

Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Filter "site:Redmond*" | Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Description "Client policy rules for Redmond"

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule | Where-Object {$_.UserAgent -eq "UCCP"} | Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Action "Block"
```

The preceding command blocks the use of Unified Communications Client Platform (UCCP) clients for any client version policy rule that references UCCP as the user agent.
To carry out this task, the command first calls Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule to retrieve a collection of all the client policy rules currently in use.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those rules where the UserAgent property is equal to (-eq) UCCP.
This filtered collection is then piped to the Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule cmdlet, which takes each item in the collection and sets the Action property to Block.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 blocks the use of Unified Communications Client Platform (UCCP) clients for any client version policy rule that references UCCP as the user agent.
To carry out this task, the command first calls Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule to retrieve a collection of all the client policy rules currently in use.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those rules where the UserAgent property is equal to (-eq) UCCP.
This filtered collection is then piped to the Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule cmdlet, which takes each item in the collection and sets the Action property to Block.

Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule | Where-Object {$_.UserAgent -eq "UCCP"} | Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Action "Block"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 3 blocks the use of Unified Communications Client Platform (UCCP) clients for any client version policy rule that references UCCP as the user agent.
To carry out this task, the command first calls the Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule cmdlet to retrieve a collection of all the client policy rules currently in use.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those rules where the UserAgent property is equal to (-eq) UCCP.
This filtered collection is then piped to the Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule cmdlet, which takes each item in the collection and sets the Action property to Block.

Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule | Where-Object {$_.UserAgent -eq "UCCP"} | Set-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Action "Block"
