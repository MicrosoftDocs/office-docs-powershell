## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

This cmdlet modifies a policy that configures a user account enabled for Microsoft Lync Server 2010 or Microsoft Office Communications Server to use an Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) hosted voice mail service.
The policy determines how to route unanswered calls to the user to a hosted Exchange UM service.

A user must be enabled for Exchange UM hosted voice mail for this policy to take effect.
You can call the Get-CsUser cmdlet and check the HostedVoiceMail property to determine whether a user is enabled for hosted voice mail.
(A value of True means the user is enabled.)

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond -Destination ExUM.contoso.com
```

This command modifies the Destination property of a hosted voice mail policy named ExRedmond.
It sets the Exchange UM destination for this policy to be at FQDN ExUM.contoso.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This command modifies the Destination property of a hosted voice mail policy named ExRedmond.
It sets the Exchange UM destination for this policy to be at FQDN ExUM.contoso.com.

Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond -Destination ExUM.contoso.com

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This command modifies the Destination property of a hosted voice mail policy named ExRedmond.
It sets the Exchange UM destination for this policy to be at FQDN ExUM.contoso.com.

Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond -Destination ExUM.contoso.com

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
$a = (Get-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond).Organization
$a += ",corp3.litwareinc.com"
Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond -Organization $a
```

This command adds an Exchange tenant to the comma-separated list of tenants (organizations) for the policy ExRedmond.
The first line calls Get-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy to retrieve the policy with the Identity ExRedmond.
This cmdlet call is in parentheses because we need to first retrieve this policy.
We then use "dot notation" to retrieve the Organization property of the policy.
We save the returned string in the variable $a.
The next line uses the += operator to append the assigned string (,corp3.litwareinc.com) to the end of the string stored in variable $a.
(Note the comma in the assigned string.
Organization is a comma-separated list, so if there's already a value in the list any additional values need to be preceded by a comma.) Finally, in the last line we call Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy and assign the new Organization string by passing the variable $a to the parameter Organization.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This command adds an Exchange tenant to the comma-separated list of tenants (organizations) for the policy ExRedmond.

We save the returned string in the variable $a.
The next line uses the += operator to append the assigned string (,corp3.litwareinc.com) to the end of the string stored in variable $a.
(Note the comma in the assigned string.
Organization is a comma-separated list, so if there's already a value in the list any additional values need to be preceded by a comma.) Finally, in the last line we call Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy and assign the new Organization string by passing the variable $a to the parameter Organization.

$a = (Get-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond).Organization

$a += ",corp3.litwareinc.com"

Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond -Organization $a
