Regions within a network are linked through physical WAN connectivity.
This cmdlet does not impact any physical connections, but it does remove the link from the CAC configuration.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsNetworkRegionLink cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsNetworkRegionLink"}

This cmdlet does not impact any physical connections, but it does remove the link from the CAC configuration.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Remove-CsNetworkRegionLink -Identity NA_EMEA
```

This first example removes the network region link with the Identity NA_EMEA.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This first example removes the network region link with the Identity NA_EMEA.

Remove-CsNetworkRegionLink -Identity NA_EMEA

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This first example removes the network region link with the Identity NA_EMEA.

Remove-CsNetworkRegionLink -Identity NA_EMEA

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsNetworkRegionLink | Where-Object {$_.BWPolicyProfileID -eq "HighBWLimits"} | Remove-CsNetworkRegionLink
```

Example 2 removes all network region links that are using the bandwidth policy profile named HighBWLimits.
The first cmdlet called in the example is Get-CsNetworkRegionLink (with no parameters), which will retrieve all region links.
This collection of links is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
Where-Object looks through each member of the collection one-by-one, checking the value of the BWPolicyProfileID property.
If this property is equal to (-eq) HighBWLimits, we pipe that member to the Remove-CsNetworkRegionLink cmdlet, which removes the link.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 removes all network region links that are using the bandwidth policy profile named HighBWLimits.
The first cmdlet called in the example is Get-CsNetworkRegionLink (with no parameters), which will retrieve all region links.
This collection of links is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
Where-Object looks through each member of the collection one-by-one, checking the value of the BWPolicyProfileID property.
If this property is equal to (-eq) HighBWLimits, we pipe that member to the Remove-CsNetworkRegionLink cmdlet, which removes the link.

Get-CsNetworkRegionLink | Where-Object {$_.BWPolicyProfileID -eq "HighBWLimits"} | Remove-CsNetworkRegionLink

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
