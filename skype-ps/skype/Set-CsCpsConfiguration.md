# Set-CsCpsConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Modifies an existing collection of Call Park service settings.
Call parking is a service that allows a user to "park" an incoming phone call.
Parking a call transfers it to a number in a specified range, or orbit, and then immediately places the call on hold.
Anyone (not just the person who originally answered the call) can resume the conversation from any telephone simply by entering the correct number.

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

This cmdlet is used to modify an existing Call Park service configuration.
A Call Park service configuration specifies what happens to a call once it's parked.
For example, if a parked call isn't answered after a period of time, it can be automatically forwarded to someone else, such as an administrator, or to a Response Group.
Calls can be configured to ring after a certain period of time to ensure the call isn't forgotten.
In addition, Call Park service can be configured to play music on hold to the caller while the call is parked.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsCpsConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1 -MaxCallPickupAttempts 2
```

The command shown in Example 1 modifies the Call Park service configuration with the Identity site:Redmond1 by setting the maximum number of times a parked call will ring back to the answering phone to 2.
This is done by including the MaxCallPickupAttempts parameter and setting the parameter value to 2.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 modifies the Call Park service configuration with the Identity site:Redmond1 by setting the maximum number of times a parked call will ring back to the answering phone to 2.
This is done by including the MaxCallPickupAttempts parameter and setting the parameter value to 2.

Set-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1 -MaxCallPickupAttempts 2

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 modifies the Call Park service configuration with the Identity site:Redmond1 by setting the maximum number of times a parked call will ring back to the answering phone to 2.
This is done by including the MaxCallPickupAttempts parameter and setting the parameter value to 2.

Set-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1 -MaxCallPickupAttempts 2

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsCpsConfiguration | Set-CsCpsConfiguration -MaxCallPickupAttempts 2
```

Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, we set all (not just one) Call Park service configurations to have a MaxCallPickupAttempts property value of 2.
To do this, Get-CsCpsConfiguration is used to retrieve a collection of all the Call Park service settings in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Set-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet, which takes each individual item in the collection and sets the value of the MaxCallPickupAttempts property to 2.

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1 -CallPickupTimeoutThreshold 00:00:45
```

This example modifies the call park configuration for site Remond1 by setting the amount of time that will elapse before a parked call will ring back (contained in the CallPickupTimeoutThreshold property) to 45 seconds.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example modifies the call park configuration for site Redmond1 by setting the amount of time that will elapse before a parked call will ring back (contained in the CallPickupTimeoutThreshold property) to 45 seconds.

Set-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1 -CallPickupTimeoutThreshold 00:00:45

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
