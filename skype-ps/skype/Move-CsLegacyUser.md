## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Many organizations that install Lync Server 2010 are also running an earlier version of the software (either Office Communications Server 2007 R2 or Office Communications Server 2007).
Fortunately, this does not present a problem: you can run both the latest version of the software and an earlier version of the software simultaneously.
Over time, you can then begin to migrate your configuration settings, your policies, and, finally, your user accounts to Lync Server 2010.

The Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet not only enables you to migrate users to Lync Server 2010, but also gives you considerable control over the migration process.
For example, in its simplest form you can give Move-CsLegacyUser the identity of the user to be migrated and the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Lync Server 2010 Registrar pool where that user account will be homed; in turn, Move-CsLegacyUser will move the user account and will maintain any existing policies and settings that have been applied to the account.
For example, suppose Ken Myer was assigned a dial plan in Office Communications Server.
By default, when you migrate Ken's account the dial plan will be migrated as well: that means that Move-CsLegacyUser will automatically assign Ken Myer the Lync Server 2010-equivalent of the dial plan he was assigned in Communications Server 2007 R2.

Of course, that will occur only if you have migrated dial plans and if there is a Lync Server 2010-equivalent of the dial plan that Ken Myer was assigned in Communications Server 2007 R2.
Alternatively, you might have chosen to install Lync Server 2010 without migrating dial plans.
In that case, you can call Move-CsLegacyUser along with the ExcludeDialPlan parameter.
When you use this parameter, dial plans are not migrated along with the user account: that means that Ken Myer's user account will be moved to Lync Server 2010 but he will not be assigned a dial plan.
(This will be also be the case even if you did migrate dial plans; the ExcludeDialPlan parameters prevents the migrated user account from being assigned a dial plan.) Other parameters allow you to exclude voice policies, conferencing policies, archiving policies, external access policies, and/or presence policies when migrating user accounts.

Before you can run Merge-CsLegacyTopology, you must first install the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Backward Compatibility interfaces package; this application is installed by running OCSWMIBC.msi.
(OCSWMIBC.msi can be found on the installation DVD in the Setup folder.) After installing the Compatibility interfaces package, Merge-CsLegacyUser can then be called in order to move one or more user accounts from Communications Server 2007 R2 or Communications Server 2007 to Lync Server 2010.

If you need to move a user from Lync Server back to Office Communications Server do not use the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet.
Instead, use the Move-CsUser cmdlet, and use the FQDN of the legacy Office Communications Server pool as the parameter value for Move-CsUser's Target parameter.
For example:

Move-CsUser -Identity "Ken Myer" -Target "ocs13.litwareinc.com"

Who can run this cmdlet?
By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself) run the following command from the  Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "Move-CsLegacyUser"}

Many organizations that install Skype for Business Server 2015 are also running an earlier version of the software.
Fortunately, this does not present a problem: you can run both the latest version of the software and an earlier version of the software simultaneously.
Over time, you can then begin to migrate your configuration settings, your policies, and, finally, your user accounts to Skype for Business Server 2015.

The Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet not only enables you to migrate users to Skype for Business Server 2015, but also gives you considerable control over the migration process.
For example, in its simplest form you can give the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet the identity of the user to be migrated and the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Skype for Business Server 2015 Registrar pool where that user account will be homed; in turn, the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet will move the user account and will maintain any existing policies and settings that have been applied to the account.
For example, suppose Ken Myer was assigned a dial plan in Communications Server 2007 R2.
By default, when you migrate Ken's account the dial plan will be migrated as well: that means that the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet will automatically assign Ken Myer the Skype for Business Server 2015 equivalent of the dial plan he was previously assigned.

Of course, that will occur only if you have migrated dial plans and if there is a Skype for Business Server 2015 equivalent of the dial plan that Ken Myer was previously assigned.
Alternatively, you might have decided not to migrate dial plans.
In that case, you can call the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet along with the ExcludeDialPlan parameter.
When you use this parameter, dial plans are not migrated along with the user account: that means that Ken Myer's user account will be moved but he will not be assigned a dial plan.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Move-CsLegacyUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

In the preceding example, Move-CsLegacyUser is used to migrate the user account with the Identity Pilar Ackerman to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.
Because no additional parameters are included, any policies or settings previously assigned to this account will be migrated as well.
That means that, if a legacy policy (such as a dial plan) was assigned to Pilar Ackerman, she will be assigned the Lync Server 2010-equivalent when her account is moved.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 1, Move-CsLegacyUser is used to migrate the user account with the Identity Pilar Ackerman to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.
Because no additional parameters are included, any policies or settings previously assigned to this account will be migrated as well.
That means that, if a legacy policy (such as a dial plan) was assigned to Pilar Ackerman, she will be assigned the Lync Server-equivalent when her account is moved.

Move-CsLegacyUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 1, the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet is used to migrate the user account with the Identity Pilar Ackerman to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.
Because no additional parameters are included, any policies or settings previously assigned to this account will be migrated as well.
That means that, if a legacy policy (such as a dial plan) was assigned to Pilar Ackerman, she will be assigned the Skype for Business Server 2015 equivalent when her account is moved.

Move-CsLegacyUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Move-CsLegacyUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -ExcludeDialPlan
```

The command shown in Example 2 migrates Pilar Ackerman's user account, but does not migrate any dial plans previously assigned to her account.
After the account is migrated, Pilar will not have an assigned dial plan.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 migrates Pilar Ackerman's user account, but does not migrate any dial plans previously assigned to her account.
After the account is migrated, Pilar will not have an assigned dial plan.

Move-CsLegacyUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -ExcludeDialPlan

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 migrates Pilar Ackerman's user account, but does not migrate any dial plans previously assigned to her account.
After the account is migrated, Pilar will not have an assigned dial plan.

Move-CsLegacyUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -ExcludeDialPlan

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsUser -OU "ou=Finance,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Move-CsLegacyUser -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

In Example 3, all the user accounts in the Finance OU are moved to the Lync Server Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To carry out this task, the command first uses Get-CsUser and the OU parameter to retrieve a collection of all the user accounts in the Finance OU.
After the accounts have been retrieved, the collection is piped to Move-CsLegacyUser, which moves each account to the new Registrar pool.
This command assumes that all the users in the Finance OU are legacy users.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 3, all the user accounts in the Finance OU are moved to the Lync Server Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To carry out this task, the command first uses Get-CsUser and the OU parameter to retrieve a collection of all the user accounts in the Finance OU.
After the accounts have been retrieved, the collection is piped to Move-CsLegacyUser, which moves each account to the new Registrar pool.
This command assumes that all the users in the Finance OU are legacy users.

Get-CsUser -OU "ou=Finance,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Move-CsLegacyUser -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 3, all the user accounts in the Finance OU are moved to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To carry out this task, the command first uses the Get-CsUser cmdlet and the OU parameter to retrieve a collection of all the user accounts in the Finance OU.
After the accounts have been retrieved, the collection is piped to the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet, which moves each account to the new Registrar pool.
This command assumes that all the users in the Finance OU are legacy users.

Get-CsUser -OU "ou=Finance,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Move-CsLegacyUser -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsUser -UnassignedUser | Move-CsLegacyUser -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

In the preceding example, Move-CsLegacyUser is used to assign a Registrar pool to all of the users that have enabled for Lync Server but are not currently assigned to a Registrar pool.
In this command, the Get-CsUser cmdlet is first called, along with the UnassignedUser parameter, to return a collection of all the users not currently assigned to a Registrar pool.
This collection is then piped to Move-CsLegacyUser, which assigns each user to the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This example assumes that all of the unassigned users are legacy users.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 4, Move-CsLegacyUser is used to assign a Registrar pool to all of the users that have enabled for Lync Server but are not currently assigned to a Registrar pool.
In this command, the Get-CsUser cmdlet is first called, along with the UnassignedUser parameter, to return a collection of all the users not currently assigned to a Registrar pool.
This collection is then piped to Move-CsLegacyUser, which assigns each user to the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This example assumes that all of the unassigned users are legacy users.

Get-CsUser -UnassignedUser | Move-CsLegacyUser -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 4, Move-CsLegacyUser is used to assign a Registrar pool to all of the users that have enabled for Skype for Business Server 2015 but are not currently assigned to a Registrar pool.
In this command, the Get-CsUser cmdlet is first called, along with the UnassignedUser parameter, to return a collection of all the users not currently assigned to a Registrar pool.
This collection is then piped to the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet, which assigns each user to the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This example assumes that all of the unassigned users are legacy users.

Get-CsUser -UnassignedUser | Move-CsLegacyUser -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Indicates the Identity of the user account to be migrated.
User Identities can be specified using one of four formats: 1) the user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (for example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory Domain Services display name (for example, Ken Myer).
User Identities can also be reference by using the user's Active Directory distinguished name.

You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
For example, the Identity "* Smith" returns all the users with a display name that ends with the string value " Smith".
