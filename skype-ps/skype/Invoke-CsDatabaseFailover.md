# Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Invokes the process in which a Lync Server 2013 Preview database fails over to its mirror database.
After failover has been completed, the mirror database will become the principal database and will handle all new database requests.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013 Preview.

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Invokes the process in which a Skype for Business Server 2015 database fails over to its mirror database.
After failover has been completed, the mirror database will become the principal database and will handle all new database requests.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.



## SYNTAX

```
Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover -DatabaseType <DatabaseNameType> -NewPrincipal <MirrorRole> -PoolFqdn <Fqdn>
 [-Confirm] [-ExcludeDatabaseList <String[]>] [-Force] [-LocalStore] [-Report <String>] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover cmdlet provides a way for administrators to "failover" one or more Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview databases.
For example, suppose you need to temporarily take down the primary database, perhaps to perform a hardware upgrade.
In that case, you can use Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover to failover from the primary database to the mirror database; when you do that, all requests for the database in question will be routed to the mirror database.
Later, when the hardware upgrade is complete, you can use this same cmdlet to failback to the primary database.

Note that any commands using Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover will fail if you have not configured both a primary database and a mirror database for the database in question.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 invokes failover for the User database found on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
The command causes the User database to failover to a previously-assigned mirror database.

Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover -PoolFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -DatabaseType "User" -NewPrincipal "Mirror"

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 invokes failover for the User database found on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
The command causes the User database to failover to a previously-assigned mirror database.

Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover -PoolFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -DatabaseType "User" -NewPrincipal "Mirror"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, all databases on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com are failed over except for the LcsCDR and LcsLog databases.
These databases are exempted from failover by using the ExcludeDatabaseList parameter.

Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover -PoolFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -ExcludeDatabase -NewPrincipal "Mirror" -ExcludeDatabaseList "LcsCDR", "LcsLog"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, all databases on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com are failed over except for the LcsCDR and LcsLog databases.
These databases are exempted from failover by using the ExcludeDatabaseList parameter.

Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover -PoolFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -ExcludeDatabase -NewPrincipal "Mirror" -ExcludeDatabaseList "LcsCDR", "LcsLog"
