## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsOutboundTranslationRule [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Call this cmdlet to remove an existing outbound translation rule.
Microsoft Lync Server 2010 normalizes phone numbers to E.164 format.
However, many private branch exchange (PBX) systems aren't able to work with this format.
Outbound translations rules translate the number to the local dialing format prior to sending the number to the Mediation Server or gateway.

Each outbound translation rule is associated with a trunk configuration.
That means that using this cmdlet to remove a rule will remove it from the trunk configuration at the corresponding scope.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsOutboundTranslationRule cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsOutboundTranslationRule"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Remove-CsOutboundTranslationRule -Identity "site:Redmond/Prefix Redmond"
```

This example removes an existing outbound translation rule for site Redmond named Prefix Redmond.
Identities are unique, so this command will delete a single rule.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example removes an existing outbound translation rule for site Redmond named Prefix Redmond.
Identities are unique, so this command will delete a single rule.

Remove-CsOutboundTranslationRule -Identity "site:Redmond/Prefix Redmond"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example removes an existing outbound translation rule for site Redmond named Prefix Redmond.
Identities are unique, so this command will delete a single rule.

Remove-CsOutboundTranslationRule -Identity "site:Redmond/Prefix Redmond"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsOutboundTranslationRule -Filter site:* | Remove-CsOutboundTranslationRule
```

This example removes all site-level outbound translation rules.
The first part of the command is a call to Get-CsOutboundTranslationRule with a Filter of site:*, which will return a collection of all rules with Identity values beginning with site:.
This collection is then piped to Remove-CsOutboundTranslationRule, which removes each rule in the collection.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
