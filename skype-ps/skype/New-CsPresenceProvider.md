## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new presence provider (with the fully qualified domain name "fabrikam.com") that will be added to the global collection of user services configuration settings.

New-CsPresenceProvider -Parent "global" -Fqdn "fabrikam.com"

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new presence provider (with the fully qualified domain name "fabrikam.com") that will be added to the global collection of user services configuration settings.

New-CsPresenceProvider -Parent "global" -Fqdn "fabrikam.com"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 adds a presence provider with the Fqdn "fabrikam.com" to all the user services configuration collections in the organization.
To do this, the command first uses Get-CsUserServicesConfiguration to return a collection of all the user services settings.
Those settings are then piped to the ForEach-Object, which takes each item in the collection and a creates a new presence provider for that collection, using "fabrikam.com" as the presence provider Fqdn and the Identity of the user services collection as the presence provider Parent.

Get-CsUserServicesConfiguration | ForEach-Object {New-CsPresenceProvider -Parent $_.Identity -Fqdn "fabrikam.com"}

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 adds a presence provider with the Fqdn "fabrikam.com" to all the user services configuration collections in the organization.
To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsUserServicesConfiguration cmdlet to return a collection of all the user services settings.
Those settings are then piped to the ForEach-Object, which takes each item in the collection and a creates a new presence provider for that collection, using "fabrikam.com" as the presence provider Fqdn and the Identity of the user services collection as the presence provider Parent.

Get-CsUserServicesConfiguration | ForEach-Object {New-CsPresenceProvider -Parent $_.Identity -Fqdn "fabrikam.com"}

## PARAMETERS

### -Fqdn
Fully qualified domain name for the presence provider.
For example:

-Fqdn "fabrikam.com"

If you use the Fqdn parameter you must also use the Parent parameter.

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None

```

### -Identity

The Identity of a presence provider is composed of two parts: the scope (Parent) where the rule has been applied (for example, service:UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com) and the provider's fully qualified domain name.
To create a new provider at the global scope use syntax similar to this:

-Identity "global/fabrikam.com"

To create a provider at the site scope, use syntax like this:

-Identity "site:Redmond/fabrikam.com"

To create a provider at the service scope (for the UserServer service only), use syntax similar to this:

-Parent "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

You cannot use the Identity parameter in the same command as the Fqdn or the Parent parameter.

```yaml
Type: XdsIdentity
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: True
Position: 2

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Parent
Scope where the new presence provider will be created.

-Parent "global"

To create a new provider at the site scope use syntax like this:

-Parent "site:Redmond"

To create a provider at the service scope (for the UserServer service only), use syntax similar to this:

-Parent "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

If you use the Parent parameter you must also include the Fqdn parameter.
However, the Parent parameter cannot be used in conjunction with the Identity parameter.
