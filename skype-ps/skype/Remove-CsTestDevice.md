**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Removes the specified device update management test device.
Test devices provide a way for administrators to test firmware updates before those updates are distributed to all the devices in an organization.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsTestDevice [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

By identifying specific Microsoft Lync 2010 Phone Edition-compatible phones or other devices as test devices, administrators can verify and approve firmware updates before those updates are rolled out to all the relevant devices in the organization.
When device update rules are imported to Microsoft Lync Server 2010, they are marked as "pending," which means that the updates corresponding to these rules will not automatically be downloaded and installed by the affected devices.

Instead, these pending rules will be downloaded and installed by any relevant test devices.
That's the idea behind test devices: new device update rules are automatically applied to test devices, giving administrators the opportunity to verify that the firmware updates work as expected.
If they do, those administrators can then mark the rules as approved; approved rules are then downloaded and installed by all the relevant devices in the organization.

Test devices are hardware devices that run Lync 2010 Phone Edition.
These devices are created by using the New-CsTestDevice cmdlet.
Once created, the devices can later be removed by running the Remove-CsTestDevice cmdlet.
Note that removing the device as a test device does not affect the actual device itself; for example, your Lync 2010 Phone Edition-compatible phone can still be used to access Lync Server 2010.
The only difference is that, because the device is no longer a test device, it will no longer download device update rules that are in the pending state.
Instead, the device will wait until the rules have been approved before downloading and installing them.

Remove-CsTestDevice can be used to remove individual test devices configured at either the global or site scope.
You can also use the cmdlet to remove all the test devices configured for a given scope.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsTestDevice cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsTestDevice"}

### -------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsTestDevice | Where-Object {$_.Name -match "LG-Nortel Phone"} | Remove-CsTestDevice
```

The command shown in Example 4 deletes all the LG-Nortel Phone test devices.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsTestDevice to return all the test devices configured for use in the organization.
That information is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which uses the -match operator to return any devices that have the string value "LG-Nortel" anywhere in the Name property.
Any test device meeting that criterion is then deleted by using Remove-CsTestDevice.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```
