# New-CsCpsConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Creates a new collection of Call Park service settings.
Call parking is a service that allows a user to "park" an incoming phone call.
Parking a call transfers it to a number in a specified range, or orbit, and immediately places the call on hold.
Anyone (not just the person who originally answered the call) can resume the conversation from any telephone by entering the correct number.

New-CsCpsConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-CallPickupTimeoutThreshold <TimeSpan>]

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

This cmdlet is used to create a new Call Park service configuration.
When Call Park service is installed, global settings are configured by default and can be updated but cannot be removed.
("Removing" the global settings simply resets them to the default values.) Therefore this cmdlet is used to create only site-specific settings.

A Call Park service configuration specifies what happens to a call once it's parked.
For example, if a parked call isn't answered after a period of time it can be automatically forwarded to someone else, such as an administrator, or to a Response Group.
Calls can be configured to ring after a certain period of time to ensure the call isn't forgotten.
In addition, Call Park service can be configured to play music on hold to the caller while the call is parked.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsCpsConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1 -EnableMusicOnHold $False
```

The command shown in Example 1 uses the New-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet to create a Call Park service configuration for site Redmond1.
This configuration will be created with default values with the exception of EnableMusicOnHold.
This command sets this property to False, meaning the caller whose call has been parked will not hear anything while on hold.
(EnableMusicOnHold is set to True by default, assuming Call Park service has been deployed.)

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 uses the New-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet to create a Call Park service configuration for site Redmond.
This configuration will be created with default values with the exception of EnableMusicOnHold.
This command sets this property to False, meaning the caller whose call has been parked will not hear anything while on hold.
(EnableMusicOnHold is set to True by default, assuming Call Park service has been deployed.)

New-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EnableMusicOnHold $False

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 uses the New-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet to create a Call Park service configuration for site Redmond.
This configuration will be created with default values with the exception of EnableMusicOnHold.
This command sets this property to False, meaning the caller whose call has been parked will not hear anything while on hold.
(EnableMusicOnHold is set to True by default, assuming Call Park service has been deployed.)

New-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EnableMusicOnHold $False

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1 -OnTimeoutURI sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com
```

The command shown in Example 2 uses the New-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet to create a Call Park service configuration for site Redmond1.
By default no OnTimeoutURI is supplied, so this example adds a value for that parameter.
In this case the OnTimeoutURI is set to sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com.
The value passed to this parameter must begin with the string "sip:" and should point to a user or Response Group that will receive parked calls that aren't picked up after a specified number of ringback attempts.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 uses the New-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet to create a Call Park service configuration for site Redmond1.
By default no OnTimeoutURI is supplied, so this example adds a value for that parameter.
In this case the OnTimeoutURI is set to sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com.
The value passed to this parameter must begin with the string "sip:" and should point to a user or Response Group that will receive parked calls that aren't picked up after a specified number of ringback attempts.

New-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -OnTimeoutURI sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 uses the New-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet to create a Call Park service configuration for site Redmond1.
By default no OnTimeoutURI is supplied, so this example adds a value for that parameter.
In this case the OnTimeoutURI is set to sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com.
The value passed to this parameter must begin with the string "sip:" and should point to a user or Response Group that will receive parked calls that aren't picked up after a specified number of ringback attempts.

New-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -OnTimeoutURI sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1 -MaxCallPickupAttempts 2
```

This command uses the New-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet to create a Call Park service configuration for site Redmond1.
For this site, the MaxCallPickupAttempts has been set to 2.
That means the call rings back up to two times.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This command uses the New-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet to create a Call Park service configuration for site Redmond1.
For this site, the MaxCallPickupAttempts has been set to 2.
That means the call rings back up to two times.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This command uses the New-CsCpsConfiguration cmdlet to create a Call Park service configuration for site Redmond1.
For this site, the MaxCallPickupAttempts has been set to 2.
That means the call rings back up to two times.

New-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -MaxCallPickupAttempts 2

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The site to which the settings are applied.
This must be entered in the format site:\<sitename\>, such as site:Redmond.
A configuration will always exist at the global scope and can't be removed, so a global configuration can't be re-created with this cmdlet.
