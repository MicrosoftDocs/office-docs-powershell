# Set-CsNetworkSubnet

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Modifies an existing network subnet.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Modifies an existing network subnet.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Set-CsNetworkSubnet [[-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity>] [-Description <String>] [-MaskBits <Int32>]
 [-NetworkSiteID <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Instance
```
Set-CsNetworkSubnet [-Instance <PSObject>] [-Description <String>] [-MaskBits <Int32>]
 [-NetworkSiteID <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

Each subnet must be associated with a network site for the purposes of determining the geographic location of the host belonging to this subnet.
Use this cmdlet to modify the associated network site, change the description of the subnet, or modify the mask bits for the subnet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsNetworkSubnet"}

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Each subnet must be associated with a network site for the purposes of determining the geographic location of the host belonging to this subnet.
Use this cmdlet to modify the associated network site, change the description of the subnet, or modify the mask bits for the subnet.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsNetworkSubnet -Identity 172.11.15.0 -MaskBits 25 -NetworkSiteID Chicago
```

This example modifies the subnet with the Identity (the Subnet ID) 172.11.15.0.
The subnet is modified with a new MaskBits value (25) and a new NetworkSiteID (Chicago).

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example modifies the subnet with the Identity (the Subnet ID) 172.11.15.0.
The subnet is modified with a new MaskBits value (25) and a new NetworkSiteID (Chicago).

Set-CsNetworkSubnet -Identity 172.11.15.0 -MaskBits 25 -NetworkSiteID Chicago

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example modifies the subnet with the Identity (the Subnet ID) 172.11.15.0.
The subnet is modified with a new MaskBits value (25) and a new NetworkSiteID (Chicago).

Set-CsNetworkSubnet -Identity 172.11.15.0 -MaskBits 25 -NetworkSiteID Chicago

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsNetworkSubnet | Where-Object {$_.NetworkSiteID -eq "Vancouver"} | Set-CsNetworkSubnet -NetworkSiteID Chicago
```

Example 2 moves all subnets on the Vancouver site to the Chicago site.
To do this, we begin by calling the Get-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet.
This will retrieve a collection of all subnets defined within the Microsoft Lync Server 2010 deployment.
This collection of subnets is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
Where-Object takes that collection and narrows it down to only those subnets with a NetworkSiteID equal to (-eq) Vancouver.
Now that the collection consists only of subnets associated with the Vancouver site, we pipe the collection to Set-CsNetworkSubnet.
We supply one parameter to Set-CsNetworkSubnet: NetworkSiteID.
By passing the parameter a value of Chicago, we're instructing Set-CsNetworkSubnet to change the network site ID of every member of the collection to Chicago.

Get-CsNetworkSubnet | Where-Object {$_.NetworkSiteID -eq "Vancouver"} | Set-CsNetworkSubnet -NetworkSiteID Chicago
