## SYNOPSIS

Removes outdated information from the specified user store.
"Outdated information" refers user data from a Registrar pool no longer paired with the specified user store.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsUserStoreBackupData -PoolFqdn <Fqdn> [-Confirm] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview enables you to associate a pair of pools.
When you do this, each pool maintains two sets of user information: information about the users homed on the pool in question and information about the users homed on the associated pool.
Maintaining both sets of user information allows Pool B to register and service the users from Pool A should Pool A need to be failed over.

If you later change the association between these two pools, the "extra" user data is not automatically deleted from the two pools; for example, Pool A will continue to store user data for Pool B.
(However, this data will no longer be updated and replicated.) The Remove-CsUserStoreBackupData enables you to delete the data from Pool B that is no longer needed on Pool A.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsUserStoreBackupData"}
