## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The backup service configuration settings are used to manage pool backups in Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview.
Note that Lync Server allows only for a single, global collection of backup configuration settings.
Among other things, that means that all your pools must be backed up using the same synchronization schedule, and that users and groups authorized to backup Pool A are also allowed to backup Pools B, C, D, and E.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsBackupServiceConfiguration"}

Lync Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the Set-CsBackupServiceConfiguration cmdlet are not available in the Lync Server Control Panel.
