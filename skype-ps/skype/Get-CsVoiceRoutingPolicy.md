## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Voice routing policies are used in "hybrid" scenarios: when some of your users are homed on the on-premises version of Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview and other users are homed on the Office 365 version of Lync Server.
Assigning your Office 365 users a voice routing policy enables those users to receive and to place phones calls to the public switched telephone network by using your on-premises SIP trunks.

Note that simply assigning a user a voice routing policy will not enable them to make PSTN calls via Office 365.
Among other things, you will also need to enable those users for Enterprise Voice and will need to assign them an appropriate voice policy and dial plan.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy"}

Voice routing policies are used in "hybrid" scenarios: when some of your users are homed on the on-premises version of Skype for Business Server 2015 and other users are homed on Skype for Business Online.

Note that simply assigning a user a voice routing policy will not enable them to make PSTN calls via Skype for Business Online.
Among other things, you will need to enable those users for Enterprise Voice as well as assign them an appropriate voice policy and dial plan.

The functions carried out by the Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.

Skype for Business Online supports two predefined routing policies.
One allows international calls and the other doesn't.
They are named respectively InternationalCallsAllowed, and InternationalCallsDisallowed.
Granting one of these policies to a user will either allow or disallow international calling for that user.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 returns information for all the voice routing policies configured for use in the organization.

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Online)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 returns information for all the voice routing policies configured for use in the organization.

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 returns information for all the voice routing policies configured for use in the organization.

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, information is returned for a single voice routing policy: the policy with the Identity RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy.

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Online)
```

```

In Example 2, information is returned for a single voice routing policy: the policy with the Identity RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy.

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, information is returned for a single voice routing policy: the policy with the Identity RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy.

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy"

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 3 returns information about all the voice routing policies configured at the per-user scope.
To do this, the command uses the Filter parameter and the filter value "tag:*"; that filter value limits the returned data to policies that have an Identity that begins with the string value "tag:".

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Filter "tag:*"

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Online)
```

```

The command shown in Example 3 returns information about all the voice routing policies configured at the per-user scope.
To do this, the command uses the Filter parameter and the filter value "tag:*"; that filter value limits the returned data to policies that have an Identity that begins with the string value "tag:".

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Filter "tag:*"

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 3 returns information about all the voice routing policies configured at the per-user scope.
To do this, the command uses the Filter parameter and the filter value "tag:*"; that filter value limits the returned data to policies that have an Identity that begins with the string value "tag:".

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Filter "tag:*"

### -------------------------- Example 4 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 4, information is returned only for those voice routing policies that include the PSTN usage "Long Distance".
To carry out this task, the command first calls Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the voice routing policies configured for use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those policies where the PstnUsages property includes (-contains) the usage "Long Distance".

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy | Where-Object {$_.PstnUsages -contains "Long Distance"}

### -------------------------- Example 4 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Online)
```

```

In Example 4, information is returned only for those voice routing policies that include the PSTN usage "Long Distance".
To carry out this task, the command first calls the Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy cmdlet without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the voice routing policies configured for use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those policies where the PstnUsages property includes (-contains) the usage "Long Distance".

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy | Where-Object {$_.PstnUsages -contains "Long Distance"}

### -------------------------- Example 4 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 4, information is returned only for those voice routing policies that include the PSTN usage "Long Distance".

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy | Where-Object {$_.PstnUsages -contains "Long Distance"}

### -------------------------- Example 5 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 5 is a variation on the command shown in Example 4; in this case, however, information is returned only for those voice routing policies that do not include the PSTN usage "Long Distance".
In order to do that, the Where-Object cmdlet uses the -notcontains operator, which limits returned data to policies that do not include the usage "Long Distance".

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy | Where-Object {$_.PstnUsages -notcontains "Long Distance"}

### -------------------------- Example 5 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Online)
```

```

Example 5 is a variation on the command shown in Example 4; in this case, however, information is returned only for those voice routing policies that do not include the PSTN usage "Long Distance".
In order to do that, the Where-Object cmdlet uses the -notcontains operator, which limits returned data to policies that do not include the usage "Long Distance".

Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy | Where-Object {$_.PstnUsages -notcontains "Long Distance"}

### -------------------------- Example 5 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
