## SYNTAX

```
Get-CsWindowsService [[-Name] <String>] [-ComputerName <String>] [-ExcludeActivityLevel] [-Report <String>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Many Lync Server 2010 components run as standard Windows services; for example, the Lync Server Conferencing Attendant application is actually a service named  RTCCAA.
The Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet enables you to retrieve detailed information about these Lync Server services and only these services.
That's because the cmdlet has been designed to ignore any service that is not part of Lync Server.

The fact that Get-CsWindowsService automatically filters out non-Lync Server services is one advantage the cmdlet offers over the generic Get-Service cmdlet that ships as part of Windows PowerShell.
In addition to that, there is another reason to use Get-CsWindowsService if you need to retrieve information for a Lync Server service: Get-CsWindowsService returns useful data that Get-Service does not return.
For example, when returning information about the Lync Server Conferencing Attendant service, Get-CsWindowsService reports back the number of concurrent calls being handled by the service (the service activity level).
Get-Service does not.

By default Get-CsWindowsService runs against the local computer.
However, by including the ComputerName parameter you can return information about the Lync Server services running on a remote computer.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
In addition, you must also be a member of the Performance Monitor Users group on the destination computer in order to run this cmdlet.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "Get-CsWindowsService"}

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Many Skype for Business Server 2015 components run as standard Windows services; for example, the Skype for Business Server 2015 Conferencing Attendant application is actually a service named RTCCAA.
The Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet enables you to retrieve detailed information about these Skype for Business Server 2015 services and only these services.
That's because the cmdlet has been designed to ignore any service that is not part of Skype for Business Server 2015.

The fact that the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet automatically filters out non-Skype for Business Server 2015 services is one advantage the cmdlet offers over the generic Get-Service cmdlet that ships as part of Windows PowerShell.
In addition to that, there is another reason to use the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet if you need to retrieve information for a Skype for Business Server 2015 service: the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet returns useful data that the Get-Service cmdlet does not return.
