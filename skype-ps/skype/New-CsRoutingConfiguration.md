# New-CsRoutingConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

This cmdlet can return an object containing the default settings for a routing configuration object.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

This cmdlet returns an object containing the default settings for a routing configuration object.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
New-CsRoutingConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Route <PSListModifier>] [-Force] [-InMemory] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [-CallViaWorkCallerId <String>] [-EnableLocationBasedRouting <Boolean>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

A routing configuration is a container for all voice routes defined within a Microsoft Lync Server 2010 deployment.
To create a new voice route, use the New-CsVoiceRoute cmdlet.

A routing configuration can be defined only at the global level.
In addition, you cannot have individually named routing configurations; there is only one voice route list for the entire Lync Server 2010 deployment.
In the Lync Server 2010 implementation of Windows PowerShell, if you try to create an object that already exists by calling a cmdlet beginning with the New verb, you'll receive an error message.
Every implementation of Lync Server 2010 includes a default routing configuration object with a Global Identity.
What this means is that the only voice route list that could be created already exists.
So a call to New-CsRoutingConfiguration will always return an error message and will not create a new routing configuration.

The only exception to this is if you specify the InMemory parameter in the call to this cmdlet.
This command will create an object only in memory that contains a default list of voice routes.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsRoutingConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsRoutingConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
$x = New-CsRoutingConfiguration -Identity global -InMemory
```

This command creates an object containing the default routing configuration values and assigns that object to the variable $x.
Any other use of this cmdlet will return an error.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This command creates an object containing the default routing configuration values and assigns that object to the variable $x.
Any other use of this cmdlet will return an error.

$x = New-CsRoutingConfiguration -Identity global -InMemory

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This command creates an object containing the default routing configuration values and assigns that object to the variable $x.
Any other use of this cmdlet will return an error.

$x = New-CsRoutingConfiguration -Identity global -InMemory
