## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Confirm] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Tenant <Guid>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

By default, users are not granted access to the Persistent Chat service; that access can only be granted if the user is managed by a Persistent Chat policy that allows for the user of the service.
When you install Lync 2013 Preview, all your users are managed by a global Persistent Chat policy in which the use of Persistent Chat is disabled.
If you want to give all your users access to the service you can simply set the EnablePersistentChat property in this global policy to True.
Alternatively, you can create additional policies at the site or at the per-user scope, and thus provide Persistent Chat access to some users while denying this access to other users.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy"}

Lync Server Control Panel: To remove a Persistent Chat policy using the Lync Server Control Panel, click Persistent Chat and then click Persistent Chat Policy.
Select the policy to be removed, click Edit, and then click Delete.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 removes the per-user Persistent Chat policy with the Identity RedmondPersistentChatPolicy.

Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy -Identity "RedmondPersistentChatPolicy"

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 removes the per-user Persistent Chat policy with the Identity RedmondPersistentChatPolicy.

Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy -Identity "RedmondPersistentChatPolicy"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, all the Persistent Chat policies applied to the site scope are deleted.
To do this, the command first uses Get-CsPersistentChatPolicy and the Filter parameter to return all the Persistent Chat policies configured at the site scope.
(This is done by using the filter value "site:*".) These policies are then piped to, and deleted by, the Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy cmdlet.

Get-CsPersistentChatPolicy -Filter "site:*" | Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, all the Persistent Chat policies applied to the site scope are deleted.
To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsPersistentChatPolicy cmdlet and the Filter parameter to return all the Persistent Chat policies configured at the site scope.
(This is done by using the filter value "site:*".) These policies are then piped to, and deleted by, the Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy cmdlet.

Get-CsPersistentChatPolicy -Filter "site:*" | Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 3, all the Persistent Chat policies in which Persistent Chat is enabled are deleted.
To carry out this task, the command first calls Get-CsPersistentChatPolicy without any parameters; this returns a collection of all the Persistent Chat policies configured for use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those policies where the EnablePersistentChat property is equal to true ($True).
That collection is then piped to Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy, which deletes each policy in the collection.

Get-CsPersistentChatPolicy | Where-Object {$_.EnablePersistentChat -eq $True} | Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 3, all the Persistent Chat policies in which Persistent Chat is enabled are deleted.
To carry out this task, the command first calls the Get-CsPersistentChatPolicy cmdlet without any parameters; this returns a collection of all the Persistent Chat policies configured for use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those policies where the EnablePersistentChat property is equal to true ($True).
That collection is then piped to the Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy cmdlet, which deletes each policy in the collection.

Get-CsPersistentChatPolicy | Where-Object {$_.EnablePersistentChat -eq $True} | Remove-CsPersistentChatPolicy

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Unique identity of the Persistent Chat policy to be deleted.
To remove a site-scoped policy, use syntax similar to this:
