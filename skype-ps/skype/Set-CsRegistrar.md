## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

The Registrar is perhaps the most important component in Microsoft Lync Server 2010; without a Registrar, users would not be able to log on to the system, and Lync Server 2010 would not be able to keep track of users and their current status.
When a user logs on to Lync Server, the endpoint the user is logging on from (be it a computer, a mobile phone, or some other device) sends a REGISTER request to the registration server; in turn the server responds by challenging the client device for authentication credentials.
If the client passes the challenge (that is, if the client presents a valid set of credentials), then the user is authenticated and endpoint information such as IP address, port, and user name is logged in the registration database.
When a user logs off, this information is then removed from the database.
In between log on and log off, the Registrar keeps status information up-to-date and helps to route messages to and from the user.

The Set-CsRegistrar cmdlet provides a way for you to modify the properties of one or more Registrars in your organization.
These modifications include changing port settings as well as specifying the action that should be taken if a Registrar should become unavailable.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsRegistrar cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsRegistrar\b"}

```
Set-CsRegistrar -Identity "Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -SipPort 5072
```

The command shown in Example 1 sets the SIP port for the Registrar Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com to 5072.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 sets the SIP port for the Registrar Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com to 5072.

Set-CsRegistrar -Identity "Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -SipPort 5072

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 sets the SIP port for the Registrar Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com to 5072.

Set-CsRegistrar -Identity "Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -SipPort 5072

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsService -Registrar | ForEach-Object {Set-CsRegistrar -Identity $_.Identity -SipPort 5072}
```

The preceding command sets the SIP port for all the Registrars in the organization to 5072.
To do this, the command first uses Get-CsService and the Registrar parameter to return a collection of all the Registrars currently in use.
This collection is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which takes each Registrar in the collection and runs the Set-CsRegistrar cmdlet in order to change the SIP port to 5072.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 sets the SIP port for all the Registrars in the organization to 5072.
To do this, the command first uses Get-CsService and the Registrar parameter to return a collection of all the Registrars currently in use.
This collection is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which takes each Registrar in the collection and runs the Set-CsRegistrar cmdlet in order to change the SIP port to 5072.

Get-CsService -Registrar | ForEach-Object {Set-CsRegistrar -Identity $_.Identity -SipPort 5072}

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 sets the SIP port for all the Registrars in the organization to 5072.
To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsService cmdlet and the Registrar parameter to return a collection of all the Registrars currently in use.
This collection is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which takes each Registrar in the collection and runs the Set-CsRegistrar cmdlet in order to change the SIP port to 5072.

Get-CsService -Registrar | ForEach-Object {Set-CsRegistrar -Identity $_.Identity -SipPort 5072}

```
Set-CsRegistrar -Identity "Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -BackupRegistrar "Registrar:dublin-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -EnableAutomaticFailover $True
```

If True, the backup Registrar will be employed any time the primary Registrar is unavailable.
If False, the backup Registrar will not be used if the primary Registrar is not available.

### -FailbackDetectionInterval
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

Specifies the amount of time that the system will wait before checking to see if a Registrar that had become unavailable is now available.
If you have set EnableAutomaticFailover to True, the system will "failover" to the backup Registrar any time a Registrar becomes unavailable.
That simply means that the system will take users who are logged-on to the failed Registrar and attempt to log them on to the backup Registrar.

The FailbackDetectionInterval property specifies the amount of time that the system will wait before checking to see if the original Registrar is available again.
If so, Lync Server will then attempt to "failback" to that Registrar.
Failback simply means reverting back to the Registrar initially in use; in other words, logging users back on to their original Registrar.

Note that failback is an automated process only.
You cannot manually failback from one Registrar to another.

The detection interval can be set to any value between 30 seconds and 84,400 seconds (24 hours); specify the time span using the format hours:minutes:seconds.
For example, this sets the interval to 1 hour and 15 minutes: - FailbackDetectionInterval 01:15:00.

This parameter cannot be used unless you have specified a backup Registrar.
