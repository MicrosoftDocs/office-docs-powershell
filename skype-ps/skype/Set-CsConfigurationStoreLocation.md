## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) uses service control points (SCP) to help computers locate services.
For example, when you install Microsoft Lync Server 2010, a service control point is created that provides location information for the Central Management store used to maintain Lync Server 2010 data.
Computers that need access to the database connect to Active Directory and use the information contained in the SCP to help them locate the correct computer and the correct instance of SQL Server.

As noted, when you install Lync Server an SCP that for the Central Management store is automatically created for you.
If you need to move that database to another computer or if you need to move that database to a different instance of SQL Server, then you will need to update the corresponding service control point.
That's a task that can be carried out by using the Set-CsConfigurationStoreLocation cmdlet.
When you run this cmdlet, Set-CsConfigurationStoreLocation searches Active Directory for the computer specified by the SqlServer parameter.
The cmdlet then sets the store location to the FQDN of that computer.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsConfigurationStoreLocation cmdlet: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.

Active Directory Domain Services uses service control points (SCP) to help computers locate services.
For example, when you install Skype for Business Server 2015, a service control point is created that provides location information for the Central Management store used to maintain Skype for Business Server 2015 data.
Computers that need access to the database connect to Active Directory and use the information contained in the SCP to help them locate the correct computer and the correct instance of SQL Server.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsConfigurationStoreLocation -SqlServerFqdn atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com -SqlInstanceName Rtc
```

The command shown in Example 1 sets the Active Directory service control point for the Lync Server Central Management store.
In this example, the SCP points to the computer atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com and to the SQL Server instance Rtc.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 sets the Active Directory service control point for the Lync Server Central Management store.
In this example, the SCP points to the computer atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com and to the SQL Server instance Rtc.

Set-CsConfigurationStoreLocation -SqlServerFqdn atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com -SqlInstanceName Rtc

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 sets the Active Directory service control point for the Skype for Business Server 2015 Central Management store.
