## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The centralized logging service (which replaces the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides a way for administrators to manage logging and tracing for all computers and pools running Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview.
Centralized logging enables administrators to stop, start, and configure logging for one or more pools and computers by using a single command; for example, you can use one command to enable Address Book service logging on all your Address Book servers.
This differs from the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools, which had to be individually managed (including individually stopped and started) on each server.
In addition, the centralized logging service also provides a way for administrators to search trace logs from the command, using Windows PowerShell and the Search-CsClsLogging cmdlet.

In the Office 365 version of Lync Server, administrators can use search terms to mask personally identifiable information from support personnel who are viewing the log files.
For example, a user's name, such as Ken Myer, would not appear when viewed using the support console; instead, the name might appear as FIRST1 LAST1.
Likewise, the phone number +12065551219 might be displayed as PHONE1.

The Set-CsClsSearchTerm cmdlet enables you to modify any of the search terms currently assigned to a collection of centralized logging configuration settings.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsClsSearchTerm"}

Lync Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the Set-CsClsSearchTerm cmdlet are not available in the Lync Server Control Panel.

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before executing the command.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
Suppresses the display of any non-fatal error message that might occur when running the command.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
Unique identifier of the search term to be modified.
A search term consists of two parts: the scope where the term is configured (that is, the collection of centralized logging configuration settings where the term can be found) and the term name.
For example:

-Identity "site:Redmond/CallID"

You cannot use wildcards when specifying the Identity.

```yaml
Type: XdsIdentity
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Inserts
Specify how personally identifiable information is masked when viewing the log files.
For example, the Insert "ItemURI" indicates that user URI information should be masked.
As a result, a user URI such as sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com will appear as a generic URI that hides the user name but preserve the domain name:

Sip:USER1@litwareinc.com

Inserts mask such things as user names and computer names; phone numbers; and IP addresses.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Instance
Allows you to pass a reference to an object rather than set individual parameter values.

```yaml
Type: PSObject
Parameter Sets: Instance
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Describes what would happen if you executed the command without actually executing the command.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
