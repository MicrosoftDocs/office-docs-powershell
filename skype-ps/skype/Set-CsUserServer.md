**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Enables you to modify an existing User Services pool.
Among other things, the User Services pool provides presence information and helps to manage conferences.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Set-CsUserServer [[-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity>] [-ConferenceServer <String>]

 [-ConfDirManagementWcfTcpPort <UInt16>] [-UserPinManagementWcfHttpPort <UInt16>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

User Services is a catch-all component that performs a number of key Microsoft Lync Server 2010 roles; for example, User Services provides presence information; helps to manage conferences (through the Focus and Focus Factory); handles user authorization and user-level routing; and serves as the primary interface to the back-end database.
User Services also assists with provisioning user accounts.

Because of this, it is important for administrators to know exactly how their User Services pools have been configured and, if necessary, to modify those configurations.
You can retrieve information about your User Services pools by using this command:

Get-CsService -UserServer

Likewise, you can use the Set-CsUserServer cmdlet to make changes to any of these pools.
Set-CsUserServer enables administrators to change the user database and/or the conferencing server associated with a pool.
The cmdlet also lets you modify the port used for connections to the Focus Factory.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsUserServer cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself) run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsUserServer"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsUserServer -Identity "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -McuFactorySipPort 445
```

The command shown in Example 1 changes the McuFactorySipPort for a single User Services pool: the pool with the Identity UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In this example, the port is changed to 445.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 changes the McuFactorySipPort for a single User Services pool: the pool with the Identity UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In this example, the port is changed to 445.

Set-CsUserServer -Identity "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -McuFactorySipPort 445

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 changes the McuFactorySipPort for a single User Services pool: the pool with the Identity UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In this example, the port is changed to 445.

Set-CsUserServer -Identity "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -McuFactorySipPort 445

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsService -UserServer | ForEach-Object {Set-CsUserServer -Identity $_.Identity -McuFactorySipPort 445}
```

The command shown in Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1.
In this case, however, the McuFactorySipPort is modified for all the User Services pools in the organization.
To do this, the command starts off by using Get-CsService and the UserServer parameter to return a collection of all the User Services pool currently in use.
This collection is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which takes each pool in the collection and sets the McuFactorySipPort to 445.
The data must be piped to ForEach-Object because the Set-CsUserServer cmdlet cannot accept pipelined data itself.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1.
In this case, however, the McuFactorySipPort is modified for all the User Services pools in the organization.
To do this, the command starts off by using Get-CsService and the UserServer parameter to return a collection of all the User Services pool currently in use.
This collection is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which takes each pool in the collection and sets the McuFactorySipPort to 445.
The data must be piped to ForEach-Object because the Set-CsUserServer cmdlet cannot accept pipelined data itself.

Get-CsService -UserServer | ForEach-Object {Set-CsUserServer -Identity $_.Identity -McuFactorySipPort 445}

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```
