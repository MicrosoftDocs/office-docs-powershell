## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Confirm] [-Force] [-Tenant <Guid>] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The Apple Push Notification Service and the Microsoft Push Notification Service enable users running Lync on their Apple iPhone or Windows Phone to receive notifications about Lync events even when Lync is suspended or running in the background.
For example, users can receive notice for events such as these:

- Invitations to a new instant messaging session or conference
- New instant messages
- New voice mail

Without the push notification service users would receive these notices only when Lync was in the foreground and serving as the active application.

Administrators have the ability to enable or disable push notifications for iPhone users and/or Windows Phone users.
(By default, push notifications are disabled for both iPhone users and Windows Phone users.) Administrators can enable or disable push notifications at the global scope by using the Set-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet.
They can also create custom push notification settings at the site scope by using the New-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet.

These custom settings can later be deleted by using the Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet.
If you delete settings configured at the site scope, then users in that site will automatically be managed by the global push notification settings.

Note that Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration can also be run against the global settings.
If you do that, however, the global settings will not be removed; instead, the properties in the global settings will all be reset to their default values.
In this case, that means that push notifications will be disabled from both the Apple Push Notification Service and the Microsoft Push Notification Service.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

The Apple Push Notification Service and the Microsoft Push Notification Service enable users running Skype for Business on their Apple iPhone or Windows Phone to receive notifications about Skype for Business Server 2015 events even when Skype for Business is suspended or running in the background.
For example, users can receive notice for events such as these:

- Invitations to a new instant messaging session or conference
- New instant messages
- New voice mail

Without the push notification service users would receive these notices only when Skype for Business was in the foreground and serving as the active application.

Administrators have the ability to enable or disable push notifications for iPhone users and/or Windows Phone users.
(By default, push notifications are disabled for both iPhone users and Windows Phone users.) Administrators can enable or disable push notifications at the global scope by using the Set-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet.
They can also create custom push notification settings at the site scope by using the New-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet.

These custom settings can later be deleted by using the Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet.
If you delete settings configured at the site scope, then users in that site will automatically be managed by the global push notification settings.

Note that the Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet can also be run against the global settings.
If you do that, however, the global settings will not be removed; instead, the properties in the global settings will all be reset to their default values.
In this case, that means that push notifications will be disabled from both the Apple Push Notification Service and the Microsoft Push Notification Service.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes the collection of push notification settings assigned to the Redmond site.

Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes the collection of push notification settings assigned to the Redmond site.

Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 deletes all the push notification settings configured at the site scope.
To perform this task, the cmdlet first uses the Get-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet and the Filter parameter to return a collection of all the settings configured at the site scope; the filter value "site:*" limits the returned items to settings that have an Identity that begins with the string value "site:".
The site-scoped settings are then piped to, and deleted by, the Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet.

Get-CsPushNotificationConfiguration -Filter "site:*" | Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 deletes all the push notification settings configured at the site scope.
To perform this task, the cmdlet first uses the Get-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet and the Filter parameter to return a collection of all the settings configured at the site scope; the filter value "site:*" limits the returned items to settings that have an Identity that begins with the string value "site:".
The site-scoped settings are then piped to, and deleted by, the Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet.

Get-CsPushNotificationConfiguration -Filter "site:*" | Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 shows you how can remove all the push notification configuration settings where push notifications from the Microsoft Push Notification Service have been disabled.
To do this, the command first uses Get-CsPushNotificationConfiguration to return a collection of all the push notification settings currently in use.
That collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those settings where the EnableMicrosoftPushNotificationService property is equal to (-eq) False.
This filtered collection is then piped to Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration which, in turn, deletes each item in the collection.

Get-CsPushNotificationConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.EnableMicrosoftPushNotificationService -eq $False} | Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 3 shows you how can remove all the push notification configuration settings where push notifications from the Microsoft Push Notification Service have been disabled.
To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet to return a collection of all the push notification settings currently in use.
That collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those settings where the EnableMicrosoftPushNotificationService property is equal to (-eq) False.
This filtered collection is then piped to the Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration cmdlet which, in turn, deletes each item in the collection.

Get-CsPushNotificationConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.EnableMicrosoftPushNotificationService -eq $False} | Remove-CsPushNotificationConfiguration
