## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Call detail recording (CDR) provides a way for you to track usage of Microsoft Lync Server capabilities such as Voice over IP (VoIP) phone calls; instant messaging (IM); file transfers; audio/video (A/V) conferencing; and application sharing sessions.
CDR keeps usage information: it logs information such as the parties involved in the call; the length of the call; and whether or not any files were transferred.
However, CDR does not make a recording of the call itself.

CDR also keeps track of call error information: detailed diagnostic data for both peer-to-peer sessions and for conferencing calls.

Call detail records are stored in the SQL Server database LcsCDR.
Over time, this database has the potential to grow extremely large.
Because of that, Lync Server provides two ways for administrators to purge older records from the database: 1) you can configure Lync Server to automatically delete older CDR records each day; and/or, 2) you can use the Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge cmdlet at any time to delete CDR records from the LcsCDR database.
(Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge does this by calling the SQL Server stored procedure RtcCleanupDB.)

When you call Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge you must specify the service location of the monitoring database where the CDR records are stored (for example, MonitoringDatabase:atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com); you must also indicate the minimum age (in days) of the call detail and diagnostic data records to be deleted.
For example, if you specify a minimum age of 10 days for call detail records, then all call detail records older than 10 days will be deleted from the database.

Note that these records will be deleted even if the purging has been disabled for the specified database.
(That is, the EnablePurging property in the CDR configuration settings has been set to False.) The EnablePurging property only controls the automated purging of CDR records; it has no effect on the Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge cmdlet.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes all the records (both call detail and diagnostic records) from the monitoring database atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com that are more than 10 days old.

Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge -Identity "service:MonitoringDatabase:atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com" -PurgeCallDetailDataOlderThanDays 10 -PurgeDiagnosticDataOlderThanDays 10

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes all the records (both call detail and diagnostic records) from the monitoring database atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com that are more than 10 days old.

Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge -Identity "service:MonitoringDatabase:atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com" -PurgeCallDetailDataOlderThanDays 10 -PurgeDiagnosticDataOlderThanDays 10

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the Confirm parameter is added using this syntax:

-Confirm:$False

That syntax suppresses the confirmation prompts that would otherwise appear when purging CDR records.

Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge -Identity "service:MonitoringDatabase:atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com" -PurgeCallDetailDataOlderThanDays 10 -PurgeDiagnosticDataOlderThanDays 10 -Confirm:$False

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the Confirm parameter is added using this syntax:

-Confirm:$False

That syntax suppresses the confirmation prompts that would otherwise appear when purging CDR records.

Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge -Identity "service:MonitoringDatabase:atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com" -PurgeCallDetailDataOlderThanDays 10 -PurgeDiagnosticDataOlderThanDays 10 -Confirm:$False

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 purges all the records more than 10 days old from all the CDR databases in use in the organization.
To do this, the first command in the example uses the Get-CsService cmdlet and the MonitoringDatabase parameter to return a collection of all the monitoring databases.
This collection is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet.
In turn, ForEach-Object takes each database in the collection and then runs Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge against that database, purging all the call detail records more than 10 days old.

Get-CsService -MonitoringDatabase | ForEach-Object {Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge -Identity $_.Identity -PurgeCallDetailDataOlderThanDays 10 -PurgeDiagnosticDataOlderThanDays 10 -Confirm:$False}

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 3 purges all the records more than 10 days old from all the CDR databases in use in the organization.
To do this, the first command in the example uses the Get-CsService cmdlet and the MonitoringDatabase parameter to return a collection of all the monitoring databases.
This collection is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet.
In turn, the ForEach-Object cmdlet takes each database in the collection and then runs the Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge cmdlet against that database, purging all the call detail records more than 10 days old.

Get-CsService -MonitoringDatabase | ForEach-Object {Invoke-CsCdrDatabasePurge -Identity $_.Identity -PurgeCallDetailDataOlderThanDays 10 -PurgeDiagnosticDataOlderThanDays 10 -Confirm:$False}
