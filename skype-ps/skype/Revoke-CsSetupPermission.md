 [-GlobalCatalog <Fqdn>] [-Force] [-Report <String>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

The domain preparation that takes place when you install Lync Server 2010 does not automatically add the permissions that enable members of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group to run the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet.
That means that, by default, you must be a domain administrator in order to enable a topology.
To give members of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group the right to enable a topology, you must run the Grant-CsSetupPermissions cmdlet.
In addition, you will need to run this cmdlet against each Active Directory container that hosts computers running Lync Server.

Permissions granted by using Grant-CsSetupPermission can later be removed by using Revoke-CsSetupPermission.
If you run that cmdlet, the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group will no longer have Lync Server setup permissions for the specified Active Directory container.
In that case, you will need to be an enterprise administrator or a domain administrator in order to enable a Lync Server topology.

Who can run this cmdlet: You must be a domain administrator in order to run the Revoke-CsSetupPermission cmdlet locally.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Revoke-CsSetupPermission"}
