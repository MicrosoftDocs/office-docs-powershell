## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Voice routing policies are used in "hybrid" scenarios: when some of your users are homed on the on-premises version of Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview and other users are homed on the Office 365 version of Lync Server.
Assigning your Office 365 users a voice routing policy enables those users to receive and to place phones calls to the public switched telephone network by using your on-premises SIP trunks.

Note that simply assigning a user a voice routing policy will not enable them to make PSTN calls via Office 365.
Among other things, you will also need to enable those users for Enterprise Voice and will need to assign them an appropriate voice policy and dial plan.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy"}

Voice routing policies are used in "hybrid" scenarios: when some of your users are homed on the on-premises version of Skype for Business Server 2015 and other users are homed on Skype for Business Online.
Assigning your Skype for Business Online users a voice routing policy enables those users to receive and to place phones calls to the public switched telephone network by using your on-premises SIP trunks.

Note that simply assigning a user a voice routing policy will not enable them to make PSTN calls via Skype for Business Online.
Among other things, you will also need to enable those users for Enterprise Voice and will need to assign them an appropriate voice policy and dial plan.

Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new per-user voice routing policy with the Identity RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy.
This policy is assigned a single PSTN usage: Long Distance.

New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -Name "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -PstnUsages "Long Distance"

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new per-user voice routing policy with the Identity RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy.
This policy is assigned a single PSTN usage: Long Distance.

New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -Name "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -PstnUsages "Long Distance"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the new policy is assigned three PSTN usages: Long Distance; Local; Internal.
Multiple usages can be assigned simply by separating each usage using a comma.

New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -Name "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -PstnUsages "Long Distance", "Local", "Internal"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the new policy is assigned three PSTN usages: Long Distance; Local; Internal.
Multiple usages can be assigned simply by separating each usage using a comma.

New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -Name "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -PstnUsages "Long Distance", "Local", "Internal"
