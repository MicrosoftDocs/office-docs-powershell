## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

The Move-CsUser cmdlet enables you to move a user account enabled for Lync Server 2010 from one Registrar pool to another.
Move-CsUser affects only the user's Lync Server account location; it does not move the user's Active Directory account to a new organizational unit (OU) or other new location.

If Lync Server is coexisting with Office Communications Server 2007 R2 or Office Communications Server 2007, then the Move-CsUser cmdlet can used to move a user back from Lync Server to the legacy installation of Office Communications Server.
To move a user back to Office Communications Server, assign the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the legacy pool to the Target parameter.
If you do this, keep in mind that users moved back to Office Communications Server will likely experience functionality and data loss; that's because Lync Server has many more capabilities than either Office Communications Server 2007 or Office Communications Server 2007 R2.
Users moved back might also need to install previous versions of their client software, and may be required to reschedule meetings that were created when their user accounts were homed on Lync Server.

To move users from Communications Server 2007 or Communications Server 2007 R2 to Lync Server, use the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet.
Move-CsUser is designed to move users from one Lync Server to another Lync Server pool, or to move a user from a Lync Server pool to an Office Communications Server pool.
Move-CsLegacyUser moves users from Office Communications Server to Lync Server.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Move-CsUser cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "Move-CsUser"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Move-CsUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

In the preceding example, Move-CsUser is used to move the user account with the Identity Pilar Ackerman to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 1, Move-CsUser is used to move the user account with the Identity Pilar Ackerman to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

Move-CsUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 1, the Move-CsUser cmdlet is used to move the user account with the Identity Pilar Ackerman to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

Move-CsUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsUser -OU "ou=Finance,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Move-CsUser -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

In Example 2 all the user accounts in the Finance organizational unit (OU) are moved to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To carry out this task, the command first uses Get-CsUser and the OU parameter to retrieve a collection of all the user accounts in the Finance OU.
After the data has been retrieved, the information is piped to Move-CsUser, which moves each account in the collection to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2 all the user accounts in the Finance organizational unit (OU) are moved to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To carry out this task, the command first uses Get-CsUser and the OU parameter to retrieve a collection of all the user accounts in the Finance OU.
After the data has been retrieved, the information is piped to Move-CsUser, which moves each account in the collection to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

Get-CsUser -OU "ou=Finance,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Move-CsUser -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2 all the user accounts in the Finance organizational unit (OU) are moved to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To carry out this task, the command first uses the Get-CsUser cmdlet and the OU parameter to retrieve a collection of all the user accounts in the Finance OU.
After the data has been retrieved, the information is piped to the Move-CsUser cmdlet, which moves each account in the collection to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

Get-CsUser -OU "ou=Finance,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Move-CsUser -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Move-CsUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Force
```

In the preceding example, Move-CsUser is used to move the user account with the Identity Pilar Ackerman to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In addition, the Force parameter is used to ensure that only the account itself is moved; user data associated with that account (such conferences that Pilar has scheduled) will not be moved but will, instead, be discarded.
The Force parameter should only be used if you have tried calling Move-CsUser without the parameter and that move failed.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 3, Move-CsUser is used to move the user account with the Identity Pilar Ackerman to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In addition, the Force parameter is used to ensure that only the account itself is moved; user data associated with that account (such conferences that Pilar has scheduled) will not be moved but will, instead, be discarded.
The Force parameter should only be used if you have tried calling Move-CsUser without the parameter and that move failed.

Move-CsUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Force

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 3, the Move-CsUser cmdlet is used to move the user account with the Identity Pilar Ackerman to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In addition, the Force parameter is used to ensure that only the account itself is moved; user data associated with that account (such conferences that Pilar has scheduled) will not be moved but will, instead, be discarded.
The Force parameter should only be used if you have tried calling the Move-CsUser cmdlet without the parameter and that move failed.

Move-CsUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Force

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Indicates the Identity of the user account to be moved.
User Identities can be specified using one of four formats: 1) the user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (for example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).
User Identities can also be referenced by using the user's Active Directory distinguished name.

You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
For example, the Identity "* Smith" returns all the users with who have a display name that ends with the string value " Smith".
