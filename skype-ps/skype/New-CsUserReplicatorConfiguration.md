# New-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Creates a new collection of User Replicator configuration settings.
The User Replicator periodically retrieves up-to-date user account information from Active Directory and then synchronizes the new information with the current user data stored by Microsoft Lync Server 2010.
This cmdlet is designed for use with Microsoft Lync Online 2010 and will not work with the on-premises version of Lync Server 2010.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Creates a new collection of User Replicator configuration settings.
The User Replicator periodically retrieves up-to-date user account information from Active Directory and then synchronizes the new information with the current user data stored by Lync Server.
This cmdlet is designed for use with Lync Online and will not work with the on-premises version of Lync Server.

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Although Lync Server 2010 maintains its own database of user accounts and user account data, Lync Server still relies on Active Directory as the ultimate source for user information.
For example, when a new Active Directory user account is created, you must supply basic information about the user account (such as the Active Directory display name).
When a user is enabled for Lync Server, however, you do not need to specify a new display name.
That's because Lync Server 2010 uses the display name already stored in Active Directory.

User account information, including the Active Directory display name, is subject to change over time.
For example, a user who gets married might change her last name and, in turn, need to change her display name as well.
In order to ensure that the Lync Server database and Active Directory remain in synch, Lync Server must periodically check in with Active Directory, retrieve the latest user account updates, and then modify the Lync Server user database accordingly.
This synchronization between Active Directory and Lync Server is carried out by the User Replicator.

When you install Lync Server 2010 a global set of User Replicator configuration settings is created for you.
By default, these settings are used to manage the User Replicator on an organization-wide basis.
Management of the User Replicator consists of identifying the domains that Lync Server needs to synch with as well as indicating how often the User Replicator checks Active Directory for user account updates.
You can also create additional collections at the service scope, but only if you are working with Lync Online 2010.

New User Replicator configurations settings are created using the New-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration cmdlet.
Note that these settings can only be created at the service scope and only for Lync Online 2010.
You cannot create new User Replicator settings for the on-premises version of Lync Server.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration cmdlet: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself) run the following command from the  Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity "service:Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of User Replicator configuration settings for the service Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
Because no additional parameters are specified, the new collection will use the default user replicator values.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of User Replicator configuration settings for the service Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
Because no additional parameters are specified, the new collection will use the default user replicator values.

New-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity "service:Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of User Replicator configuration settings for the service Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
Because no additional parameters are specified, the new collection will use the default user replicator values.

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity "service:Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -ADDomaiNamingContextList @{Add="dc=fabrikam,dc=com","dc=contoso.com"}
```

Example 2 also creates a new collection of user replicator configuration settings for the service Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In this case, however, the ADDomainNamingContextList is added, along with the distinguished names of the two domains to synchronize with: fabrikam.com  and contoso.com. 
This new collection of user replicator configuration settings will only configure with those two domains, even if other domains are available.

Note that this applies only to Lync Online 2010.



**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Unique identifier of the User Replicator configuration settings to be created.
Settings can only be created at the service scope, and only for the Registrar service.
That means that new settings must have an Identity similar to this: -Identity "service:Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com".

Note that this applies only to Lync Server.



**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Unique identifier of the User Replicator configuration settings to be created.
Settings can only be created at the service scope, and only for the Registrar service.
That means that new settings must have an Identity similar to this:

```

### -ADDomainNamingContextList
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

Distinguished names of the Active Directory domains that the User Replicator must synchronize with.
For example, to add a domain to the list use syntax similar to this:

-ADDomainNamingContextList @{Add="dc=fabrikam,dc=com"}

You can add more than one domain name when calling New-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration.
To do this, simply separate the domain names by using a comma:

-ADDomainNamingContextList @{Add="dc=fabrikam,dc=com","dc=contoso,dc=com"}

If you set this property to a null value the user replicator will discover and synchronize with all available domains.
If this property is not null then the replicator will only synchronize with the domains specified in the ADDomainNamingContextList.
