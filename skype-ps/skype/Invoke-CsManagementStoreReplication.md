# Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Forces Microsoft Lync Server 2010 replication services to send complete configuration data to the specified computers.
This is done by deleting the replication status of the computers from the Central Management store.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Forces Lync Server replication services to send complete configuration data to the specified computers.
This is done by deleting the replication status of the computers from the Central Management store.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Forces Skype for Business Server 2015 replication services to send complete configuration data to the specified computers.
This is done by deleting the replication status of the computers from the Central Management store.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication [[-ReplicaFqdn] <String>] [-Force] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

When an administrator makes a change to Lync Server 2010 (for example, when an administrator creates a new voice policy or changes the Address Book server configuration settings) that change is recorded in the Central Management store.
In turn, the change must then be replicated to all the computers running Lync Server services or server roles.

In order to replicate data, the Master Replicator (running on the Central Management Server) creates a snapshot of the modified configuration data; a copy of this snapshot is then sent to each computer running Lync Server services or server roles.
On those computers, a replication agent receives the snapshot and uploads the modified data; the agent then sends the Master Replicator a message reporting the latest replication status.

Replication typically requires no human intervention; in fact, it's usually best to let the Master Replicator handle the replication process.
However, there might be occasions when you need to forcibly initiate replication on a computer (or a group of computers) without waiting for the standard replication cycle to run its course.
Should such an occasion arise, you can forcibly replicate information to a computer by using the Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication cmdlet.

Typically, replication works on an incremental basis: when data is replicated, only the changes are replicated, not the complete set of configuration data.
However, when you call Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication, you force a complete replication of all the data rather than the more typical replication of changes only.
Note that replication will not necessarily take place immediately when you call Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication.
Instead, there could be a two to three minute delay as changes are processed by the Master Replicator.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication
```

In the preceding example Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication is called without any parameters.
This forces replication to take place on all Lync Server 2010 computers.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 1, Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication is called without any parameters.
This forces replication to take place on all Lync Server computers.

Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 1, the Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication cmdlet is called without any parameters.
This forces replication to take place on all Skype for Business Server 2015 computers.

Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication -ReplicaFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
```

In Example 2, the ReplicaFqdn parameter is used when calling Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication.
That causes replication to take place only on the computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, the ReplicaFqdn parameter is used when calling Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication.
That causes replication to take place only on the computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication -ReplicaFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, the ReplicaFqdn parameter is used when calling the Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication cmdlet.
That causes replication to take place only on the computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication -ReplicaFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

## PARAMETERS

### -ReplicaFqdn
