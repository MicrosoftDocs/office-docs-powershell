# Set-CsManagementConnection

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Modifies the management connection to the Central Management store.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Modifies the management connection to the Central Management store.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Set-CsManagementConnection [-StoreProvider] <StoreProvider> [-Connection] <String> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [-EnableCaching <Boolean>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Configuration data for Microsoft Lync 2010 is stored in the Central Management store.
It is crucial that both Windows PowerShell and the management replica services be able to locate this database.
When you install Lync Server 2010, a service control point is created in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) that provides location information for this database.
Typically, computers rely on this service control point in order to connect to the Central Management store.
To see the details behind this connection (that is, if you want to know which computer the Central Management store is running on, as well information about the SQL Server connection to that Central Management store) all you have to do is run the Get-CsManagementConnection cmdlet.

For the most part, after your management connection has been set you will not need to change it.
However, in case of hardware or software failure, you might need to temporarily use a connection; for example, you can configure a computer to work from the local replica.
The Set-CsManagementConnection cmdlet provides a way for you to provide a new location for the Central Management store.

Note that any changes you make to Lync Server while using a temporary management connection will not persist if and when you switch back to your original connection.
(You can switch back by running the Remove-CsManagementConnection cmdlet.) For example, suppose you decide to temporarily use the file system as your store provider.
You change the management connection, and then create several new voice policies (each of which will be instantiated as XML files).
When you switch back to your original management connection, these new voice policies will disappear because they were never recorded in the Central Management store now being used.

You should also keep in mind that any changes made by running this cmdlet only affect the local computer.
You cannot use Set-CsManagementConnection to change the management connection on other computers.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsManagementConnection cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins, RTCUniversalServerAdmins, RTCUniversalReadOnlyAdmins.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsManagementConnection -StoreProvider Sql -Connection "atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com\rtcbackup"
```

The command shown in Example 1 changes the management connection to the SQL Server instance rtcbackup found on the computer atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 changes the management connection to the SQL Server instance rtcbackup found on the computer atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com.

Set-CsManagementConnection -StoreProvider Sql -Connection "atl-sql-001.litwareinc.com\rtcbackup"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
