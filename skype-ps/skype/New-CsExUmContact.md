**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Creates a new Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access contact object for hosted Exchange Unified Messaging (UM).
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
New-CsExUmContact -SipAddress <String> -RegistrarPool <Fqdn> -DisplayNumber <String> -OU <OUIdParameter>
 [-AutoAttendant <Boolean>] [-Description <String>] [-PassThru] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Microsoft Lync Server 2010 works with Exchange UM to provide several voice-related capabilities, including Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access.
When Exchange UM is provided as a hosted service (rather than on-premises), contact objects must be created with this cmdlet to apply the Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access functionality.
These objects are created by calling the New-CsExUmContact cmdlet.

A contact object created with this cmdlet will not be available for use within the system until a hosted voice mail policy has been applied that configures routing for the contact.
You can retrieve hosted voice mail policies by calling the Get-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy cmdlet.
From the policies retrieved you can determine whether an appropriate global or site policy exists, or if a per-user policy exists that needs to be granted to this contact.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsExUmContact cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsExUmContact"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsExUmContact -SipAddress sip:exumsa1@fabrikam.com -RegistrarPool RedmondPool.litwareinc.com -OU "OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com" -DisplayNumber 2065554567
```

This example calls the New-CsExUmContact cmdlet to create a new Exchange UM Active Directory contact object.
To create a new contact you must supply the SIP address (in this example, sip:exumsa1@fabrikam.com) of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access.
In addition, you must supply the name of the pool where the Lync Server 2010 Registrar service is running (RedmondPool.litwareinc.com), the OU where this information will be stored (OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com), and the phone number of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access (2065554567).
Because we didn't specifically set the AutoAttendant parameter, the default of False will be applied and this contact object will be assumed to be a Subscriber Access contact.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example calls the New-CsExUmContact cmdlet to create a new Exchange UM Active Directory contact object.
To create a new contact you must supply the SIP address (in this example, sip:exumsa1@fabrikam.com) of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access.
In addition, you must supply the name of the pool where the Lync Server Registrar service is running (RedmondPool.litwareinc.com), the OU where this information will be stored (OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com), and the phone number of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access (2065554567).
Because we didn't specifically set the AutoAttendant parameter, the default of False will be applied and this contact object will be assumed to be a Subscriber Access contact.

New-CsExUmContact -SipAddress sip:exumsa1@fabrikam.com -RegistrarPool RedmondPool.litwareinc.com -OU "OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com" -DisplayNumber 2065554567

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example calls the New-CsExUmContact cmdlet to create a new Exchange UM Active Directory contact object.
To create a new contact you must supply the SIP address (in this example, sip:exumsa1@fabrikam.com) of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access.
In addition, you must supply the name of the pool where the Skype for Business Server 2015 Registrar service is running (RedmondPool.litwareinc.com), the OU where this information will be stored (OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com), and the phone number of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access (2065554567).
Because we didn't specifically set the AutoAttendant parameter, the default of False will be applied and this contact object will be assumed to be a Subscriber Access contact.

New-CsExUmContact -SipAddress sip:exumsa1@fabrikam.com -RegistrarPool RedmondPool.litwareinc.com -OU "OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com" -DisplayNumber 2065554567

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsExUmContact -SipAddress sip:exumaa1@fabrikam.com -RegistrarPool RedmondPool.litwareinc.com -OU "OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com" -DisplayNumber 2065559876 -AutoAttendant $True
```

This example is similar to Example 1 in that it calls the New-CsExUmContact cmdlet to create a new Exchange UM contact.
We again create a new Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access contact, this time with the SIP address sip:exumaa1@fabrikam.com.
We then supply the name of the pool where the Lync Server 2010 Registrar service is running (RedmondPool.litwareinc.com), the OU where this information will be stored (OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com), and the phone number of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access (2065554567).
The difference in this example is that we set the optional parameter AutoAttendant to True ($True) to show that this object is, in fact, an Auto Attendant contact.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example is similar to Example 1 in that it calls the New-CsExUmContact cmdlet to create a new Exchange UM contact.
We again create a new Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access contact, this time with the SIP address sip:exumaa1@fabrikam.com.
We then supply the name of the pool where the Lync Server Registrar service is running (RedmondPool.litwareinc.com), the OU where this information will be stored (OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com), and the phone number of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access (2065554567).
The difference in this example is that we set the optional parameter AutoAttendant to True ($True) to show that this object is, in fact, an Auto Attendant contact.

New-CsExUmContact -SipAddress sip:exumaa1@fabrikam.com -RegistrarPool RedmondPool.litwareinc.com -OU "OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com" -DisplayNumber 2065559876 -AutoAttendant $True

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example is similar to Example 1 in that it calls the New-CsExUmContact cmdlet to create a new Exchange UM contact.
We again create a new Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access contact, this time with the SIP address sip:exumaa1@fabrikam.com.
We then supply the name of the pool where the Skype for Business Server 2015 Registrar service is running (RedmondPool.litwareinc.com), the OU where this information will be stored (OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com), and the phone number of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access (2065554567).
The difference in this example is that we set the optional parameter AutoAttendant to True ($True) to show that this object is, in fact, an Auto Attendant contact.

New-CsExUmContact -SipAddress sip:exumaa1@fabrikam.com -RegistrarPool RedmondPool.litwareinc.com -OU "OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com" -DisplayNumber 2065559876 -AutoAttendant $True
