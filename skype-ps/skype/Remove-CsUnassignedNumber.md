Unassigned numbers are phone numbers that have been assigned to an organization but that have not been assigned to specific users or phones.
Microsoft Lync Server 2010 can be set up to route calls to appropriate destinations when an unassigned number is called.
This cmdlet removes the settings that define that routing.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Remove-CsUnassignedNumber -Identity UNSet1
```

In this example, the unassigned number settings with the Identity UNSet1 are removed.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In this example, the unassigned number settings with the Identity UNSet1 are removed.

Remove-CsUnassignedNumber -Identity UNSet1

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsUnassignedNumber | Where-Object {$_.AnnouncementName -match "Welcome"} | Remove-CsUnassignedNumber
```

Example 2 removes all unassigned number settings where the name of the assigned announcement contains the string Welcome.
The command begins with a call to Get-CsUnassignedNumber, which returns a collection of all unassigned number settings.
This collection is then passed to the Where-Object cmdlet, which narrows down the collection to only those unassigned number settings with an AnnouncementName that includes (-match) the string Welcome.
Finally, the narrowed-down collection is passed to Remove-CsUnassignedNumber, which removes everything left in the collection.
