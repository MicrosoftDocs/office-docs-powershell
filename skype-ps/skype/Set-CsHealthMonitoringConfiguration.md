## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Synthetic transactions are used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010 to verify that users are able to successfully complete common tasks such as logging on to the system, exchanging instant messages, or making calls to a phone located on the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
These tests can be conducted manually by an administrator, or they can be automatically run by an application such as Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (formerly Microsoft Operations Manager).

Synthetic transactions can be conducted in two different ways.
Many administrators will use the CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration cmdlets to set up test accounts for each of their Registrar pools.
These test accounts are a pair of user accounts that have been preconfigured for use with synthetic transactions.
(Typically these are test accounts and not accounts that belong to actual users.) When test accounts are configured for a pool, administrators can run a synthetic transaction against that pool without having to specify the identities of (and supply the credentials for) the user accounts involved in the test.
Instead, the synthetic transaction will automatically use the preconfigured test accounts when performing its checks.

Alternatively, administrators can run a synthetic transaction using actual user accounts.
For example, if two users are unable to exchange instant messages, an administrator can run a synthetic transaction using the two user accounts in question (as opposed to a pair of test accounts).
If you decide to conduct a synthetic transaction using actual user accounts that you will have to supply the credentials for each user.

After you have configured health monitoring configuration settings, you can modify those settings at any time by using the Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration cmdlet.
This cmdlet provides a way for you to change either (or both) of the test accounts configured for use with a pool .

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -Identity atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -FirstTestSamAccountName "litwareinc\kenmyer"
```

The command shown in Example 1 configures the first test user assigned to the health monitoring configuration settings for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In this example, the SIP address for the new test user is set to sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com and the SamAccountName for the test user is set to kenmyer.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 configures the first test user assigned to the health monitoring configuration settings for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In this example, the SIP address for the new test user is set to sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com and the SamAccountName for the test user is set to kenmyer.

Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -Identity atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -FirstTestSamAccountName "litwareinc\kenmyer"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 configures the first test user assigned to the health monitoring configuration settings for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In this example, the SIP address for the new test user is set to sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com and the SamAccountName for the test user is set to kenmyer.

Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -Identity atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -FirstTestSamAccountName "litwareinc\kenmyer"

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration | Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -FirstTestSamAccountName "litwareinc\kenmyer"
```

The preceding command is a variation of the command shown in Example 1.
In this case, however, the same test user is assigned to each collection of health monitoring configuration settings in use in the organization.
To carry out this task, the command first uses Get-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration to return a collection of all the health monitoring configuration settings.
This collection is then piped to Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration, which assigns the same first test user SIP address and SamAccountName to each item in the collection.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1.
In this case, however, the same test user is assigned to each collection of health monitoring configuration settings in use in the organization.
To carry out this task, the command first uses Get-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration to return a collection of all the health monitoring configuration settings.
This collection is then piped to Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration, which assigns the same first test user SIP address and SamAccountName to each item in the collection.

Get-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration | Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -FirstTestSamAccountName "litwareinc\kenmyer"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1.
In this case, however, the same test user is assigned to each collection of health monitoring configuration settings in use in the organization.
To carry out this task, the command first uses the Get-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration cmdlet to return a collection of all the health monitoring configuration settings.
This collection is then piped to the Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration cmdlet, which assigns the same first test user SIP address and SamAccountName to each item in the collection.

Get-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration | Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -FirstTestSamAccountName "litwareinc\kenmyer"

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.FirstTestUserSipUri -eq "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com"} | Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -FirstTestSamAccountName "litwareinc\kenmyer"
```

Example 3 shows how you can do a search-and-replace for the first test user assigned to a collection of health configuration settings; in this example, the user with the SIP address sip:pilar@litwareinc.com is replaced any time that user appears as the first test user in a collection.

To do this, the command first calls Get-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration without any additional parameters; that returns a collection of all the health monitoring configuration settings currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those items where the FirstTestUserSipUri property is equal to (-eq) sip:pilar@litwareinc.com.
That filtered collection is then piped to Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration, which takes each item in the collection and sets the value of the FirstTestUserSipUri property to sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com and the value of the FirstTestSamAccountName property to kenmyer.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 shows how you can do a search-and-replace for the first test user assigned to a collection of health configuration settings; in this example, the user with the SIP address sip:pilar@litwareinc.com is replaced any time that user appears as the first test user in a collection.

To do this, the command first calls Get-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration without any additional parameters; that returns a collection of all the health monitoring configuration settings currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those items where the FirstTestUserSipUri property is equal to (-eq) sip:pilar@litwareinc.com.
That filtered collection is then piped to Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration, which takes each item in the collection and sets the value of the FirstTestUserSipUri property to sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com and the value of the FirstTestSamAccountName property to kenmyer.

Get-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.FirstTestUserSipUri -eq "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com"} | Set-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -FirstTestSamAccountName "litwareinc\kenmyer"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```
