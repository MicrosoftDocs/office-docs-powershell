# Remove-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Removes the specified collection of User Replicator configuration settings.
The User Replicator periodically retrieves up-to-date user account information from Active Directory and then synchronizes the new information with the current user data stored by Microsoft Lync Server 2010.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Removes the specified collection of User Replicator configuration settings.
The User Replicator periodically retrieves up-to-date user account information from Active Directory and then synchronizes the new information with the current user data stored by Lync Server.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Removes the specified collection of User Replicator configuration settings.
The User Replicator periodically retrieves up-to-date user account information from Active Directory and then synchronizes the new information with the current user data stored by Skype for Business Server 2015.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Although Lync Server 2010 maintains its own database of user accounts and user account data, Lync Server still strongly on Active Directory as the ultimate source for user information.
For example, when a new Active Directory user account is created, you must supply basic information about the user account (such as the Active Directory display name).
However, when a user is enabled for Lync Server you do not need to specify a new display name.
That's because Lync Server uses the display name already stored in Active Directory.

Of course, user account information, including the Active Directory display name, is subject to change over time.
For example, a user who gets married might change her last name and, in turn, need to change her display name as well.
In order to ensure that the Lync Server database and Active Directory remain in synch, Lync Server must periodically check in with Active Directory, retrieve the latest user account updates, and then modify the Lync Server user database accordingly.
This synchronization between Active Directory and Lync Server is carried out by the User Replicator.

When you install Lync Server a global set of User Replicator configuration settings is created for you.
By default, these settings are used to manage the User Replicator on an organization-wide basis.
Management of the User Replicator consists of identifying the domains that Lync Server needs to synch with as well as indicating how often the User Replicator checks Active Directory for user account updates.
By default, the User Replicator discovers and synchs with all available domains.
However, by using the AdDomainNamingContextList property you can restrict synchronization to a specific set of domains: the domains that appear in the AdDomainNamingContextList  property.

You can also create additional collections at the service scope, but only if you are working with Lync Online 2010.

If your needs change, you can use the Remove-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration cmdlet to remove the custom settings created at the service scope.
Note that you can also run this cmdlet against the global configuration settings.
In that case, however, the global settings will not be removed.
Instead, all the properties within the global collection will be reset to their default values.
In the case of the User Replicator, that means erasing the list of domains that must be synchronized with (thus causing the replicator to synch with all discoverable domains), and setting the replication interval cycle to 1 minute.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself) run the following command from the  Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration"}
