## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] -Instance <AgentGroup> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

When someone calls a phone number associated with the Response Group application, the service starts by determining which workflow corresponds to the number called.
Based on the configuration of that workflow, the call might be routed to a set of interactive voice response (IVR) questions (in which the caller is asked one or more questions along the lines of "Is this question about hardware support or software support?").
Alternatively, the call might be placed in a Response Group queue; there the caller will remain on hold until someone is available to answer the call.
The people designated to answer calls are known as agents, and a collected group of agents are referred to as a Response Group agent group.
Agent groups are associated with workflows, and are further associated with like job responsibilities; for example, help desk personnel might be grouped in the Help Desk agent group while customer support agents might be grouped in the Customer Support agent group.

New agent groups are created by using the New-CsRgsAgentGroup cmdlet.
If you need to delete an agent group, this can be done by calling the Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup cmdlet.
Note that this cmdlet deletes the entire group, and all the agents in that group.
If you only want to remove a single agent from a group, use the Set-CsRgsAgentGroup cmdlet instead.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsRgsAgentGroup -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com | Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup
```

The preceding command deletes all the Response Group agent groups configured for use on the service ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, the command first uses Get-CsRgsAgentGroup to return all the agent groups for ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
Those groups are then piped to, and removed by, the Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup cmdlet.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes all the Response Group agent groups configured for use on the service ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, the command first uses Get-CsRgsAgentGroup to return all the agent groups for ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
Those groups are then piped to, and removed by, the Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup cmdlet.

Get-CsRgsAgentGroup -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com | Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes all the Response Group agent groups configured for use on the service ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, the command first uses Get-CsRgsAgentGroup to return all the agent groups for ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
Those groups are then piped to, and removed by, the Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup cmdlet.

Get-CsRgsAgentGroup -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com | Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsRgsAgentGroup -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -Name "Help Desk" | Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup
```

In Example 2, a single Response Group agent group is removed: the group named Help Desk.
To do this, Get-CsRgsAgentGroup is first used to return the Help Desk agent group (-Name "Help Desk") from ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This group is then piped to Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup, which removes the group from the service.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, a single Response Group agent group is removed: the group named Help Desk.
To do this, Get-CsRgsAgentGroup is first used to return the Help Desk agent group (-Name "Help Desk") from ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This group is then piped to Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup, which removes the group from the service.

Get-CsRgsAgentGroup -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -Name "Help Desk" | Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, a single Response Group agent group is removed: the group named Help Desk.
To do this, Get-CsRgsAgentGroup is first used to return the Help Desk agent group (-Name "Help Desk") from ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This group is then piped to Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup, which removes the group from the service.

Get-CsRgsAgentGroup -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -Name "Help Desk" | Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsRgsAgentGroup -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com | Where-Object {$_.RoutingMethod -ne "RoundRobin"} | Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup
```

Example 3 deletes all the Response Group agent groups on ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com that do not use the round robin routing method.
To do this, Get-CsRgsAgentGroup is first called in order to return a collection of all the agent groups found on the service ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those groups where the RoutingMethod property is not equal to (-ne) RoundRobin.
The filtered collection is then piped to Remove-CsRgsAgentGroup, which deletes each item in that collection.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
