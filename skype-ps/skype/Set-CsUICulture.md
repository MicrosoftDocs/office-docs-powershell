## SYNTAX

```
Set-CsUICulture [-Culture] <String> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Although Microsoft Lync Server 2010 is available in multiple languages, the software is not a true Multilingual User Interface (MUI) application.
Among other things, this means that the user interface for the Lync Server Management Shell does not change languages any time you change the operating system language.
For example, suppose you have installed the U.S.
English version of Lync Server 2010 and are also running the Windows operating system under U.S.
English.
If you change the operating system culture (that is, the language and regional settings) to Danish, the Lync Server Management Shell will not automatically follow suit; instead, the Lync Server Management Shell user interface (including error messages and help text) will remain in U.S.
English.
If you need to change the culture for the Lync Server Management Shell, you must run the Set-CsUICulture cmdlet.

There are two things to keep in mind when using Set-CsUICulture.
First, the cmdlet can only be used to modify Lync Server Management Shell settings on the local computer; Set-CsUICulture cannot change a remote instance of Lync Server Management Shell.
This is due to the fact that all the users of a computer share the same instance of the Lync Server Management Shell: allowing a remote user to change the culture would instantly change the culture for any other users of the Lync Server Management Shell, including the local user.

Second, you can only set the language to U.S.
English ("en-US") or to the language used when you initially installed Lync Server ("default").
For example, if you originally installed an Italian version of Lync Server, then you have two choices for configuring the UI culture: English or Italian.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsUICulture cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins, RTCUniversalServerAdmins, RTCUniversalReadOnlyAdmins.
