## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsVoiceConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Voice test configurations are used to test a phone number against a specific voice policy, route, and dial plan.
This cmdlet removes the global (and only) voice configuration, which is a container for all voice test configurations defined for a Microsoft Lync Server 2010 deployment.
"Removing" the voice configuration doesn't actually remove it; the global instance is still there.
However, it does set the list of voice test configurations to the default, which is empty.

WARNING: Removing the voice configuration (which sets the list of voice test configurations to empty) deletes all defined voice test configurations for a Lync Server 2010 deployment.
After calling this cmdlet, a call to Get-CsVoiceTestConfiguration will return no results.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsVoiceConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsVoiceConfiguration"}

```
Remove-CsVoiceConfiguration -Identity Global -Confirm
```

This example resets the Global (and only) voice configuration to the default values.
This action deletes all defined voice test configurations, so we added the Confirm parameter in order to receive a prompt asking whether we really want to perform this action before the removal takes place.
