## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Although Lync Server 2010 maintains its own database of user accounts and user account data, Lync Server still relies on Active Directory as the ultimate source for user information.
For example, when a new Active Directory user account is created, you must supply basic information about the user account (such as the Active Directory display name).
When a user is enabled for Lync Server, however, you do not need to specify a new display name for that user.
That's because Lync Server uses the display name already stored in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

Of course, user account information (including the Active Directory display name) is subject to change over time.
For example, a user who gets married might change her last name and, in turn, need to change her display name as well.
In order to ensure that the Lync Server database and Active Directory remain in synch, Lync Server must periodically check in with Active Directory, retrieve the latest user account updates, and then modify its own user database accordingly.
This synchronization between Active Directory and Lync Server is carried out by the User Replicator.

When you install Lync Server a global set of User Replicator configuration settings is created for you.
By default, these settings are used to manage the User Replicator on an organization-wide basis.
Management of the User Replicator consists of identifying the domains that Lync Server needs to synch with as well as indicating how often the User Replicator checks Active Directory for user account updates.
By default, the User Replicator discovers and synchs with all available domains.
However, by using the AdDomainNamingContextList property you can restrict synchronization to a specific set of domains: the domains that appear in the AdDomainNamingContextList  property.

If you are working with Lync Online 2010 you can also use the CsUserReplicatorConfiguration cmdlets to create and manage configuration settings at the service scope.
However, with the on-premises version of Lync Server 2010 you are limited to a single collection of configuration settings assigned to the global scope.

The Get-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration cmdlet enables administrators to return information about all the User Replicator settings currently employed in their organization.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Get-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins, RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself) run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "Get-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration"}
