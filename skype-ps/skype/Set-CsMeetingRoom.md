## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

In Lync Server, meeting rooms are self-contained computer appliances that are installed in conference rooms and supply advanced meeting capabilities such as:

One touch meeting join experience

Multi-view video gallery

Touch-enabled white-boarding on the front of room screen

Calendar integration to provide access to scheduled meetings

Content sharing and switching

In order to manage these new endpoint devices you must, among other things, create and enable a Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Preview resource mailbox account for the device, then enable that resource account for Lync Server 2013 Preview.
Note that, for Lync Server, there are no cmdlets for creating or removing meeting rooms.
Instead, you use the Enable-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet to enable meeting rooms and the Disable-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet to disable meeting rooms.
The resource account must already exist in order for you to enable the meeting room, and disabling a meeting room only removes that room from your collection of meeting rooms; it does not delete the resource mailbox account.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsMeetingRoom"}

Lync Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the Set-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet are not available in the Lync Server Control Panel.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command show in Example 1 updates the LineUri assigned to the meeting room RedmondMeetingRoom.

Set-CsMeetingRoom -Identity "RedmondMeetingRoom" -LineUri "tel:+12065551219"

### Example 1 (Skype for Business Online)
```
PS C:\> {{ Add example code here }}
```

{{ Add example description here }}

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command show in Example 1 updates the LineUri assigned to the meeting room RedmondMeetingRoom.

Set-CsMeetingRoom -Identity "RedmondMeetingRoom" -LineUri "tel:+12065551219"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, the meeting room RedmondMeetingRoom is temporarily disabled; this is done by setting the Enabled property to False ($False):

Set-CsMeetingRoom -Identity "RedmondMeetingRoom" -Enabled $False

To re-enable the room, simply set the Enabled property to True ($True):

Set-CsMeetingRoom -Identity "RedmondMeetingRoom" -Enabled $True

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, the meeting room RedmondMeetingRoom is temporarily disabled; this is done by setting the Enabled property to False ($False):

Set-CsMeetingRoom -Identity "RedmondMeetingRoom" -Enabled $False

To re-enable the room, simply set the Enabled property to True ($True):

Set-CsMeetingRoom -Identity "RedmondMeetingRoom" -Enabled $True

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 temporarily disables all the meeting rooms in the organization.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsMeetingRoom without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the available meeting rooms.
That collection is then piped to the Set-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet, which temporarily disables each room in the collection.

Get-CsMeetingRoom | Set-CsMeetingRoom -Enabled $False

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 3 temporarily disables all the meeting rooms in the organization.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the available meeting rooms.
That collection is then piped to the Set-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet, which temporarily disables each room in the collection.

Get-CsMeetingRoom | Set-CsMeetingRoom -Enabled $False

### -------------------------- Example 4 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 4, all the meeting rooms in the organization are configured to use Lync Server 2013 Preview archiving rather than Microsoft Exchange Server archiving.
To carry out this task, the command first uses Get-CsMeetingRoom to return a collection of all the available meeting rooms.
That collection is then piped to Set-CsMeetingRoom, which uses the ExchangeArchivingPolicy cmdlet to configure each room in the collection to use Lync Server archiving.

Get-CsMeetingRoom | Set-CsMeetingRoom -ExchangeArchivingPolicy "UseLyncArchivingPolicy"

### -------------------------- Example 4 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 4, all the meeting rooms in the organization are configured to use Skype for Business Server 2015 archiving rather than Exchange archiving.
To carry out this task, the command first uses the Get-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet to return a collection of all the available meeting rooms.
That collection is then piped to the Set-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet, which uses the ExchangeArchivingPolicy cmdlet to configure each room in the collection to use Skype for Business Server 2015 archiving.

Get-CsMeetingRoom | Set-CsMeetingRoom -ExchangeArchivingPolicy "UseLyncArchivingPolicy"
