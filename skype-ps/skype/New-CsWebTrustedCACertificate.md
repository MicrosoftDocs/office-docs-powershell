# New-CsWebTrustedCACertificate

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Creates a new certificate ID object based on an existing certification authority (CA) certificate.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Creates a new certificate ID object based on an existing certification authority (CA) certificate.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
New-CsWebTrustedCACertificate -Thumbprint <String> -CAStore <CAStore> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Web Services  configuration settings are used to help manage Microsoft Lync Server 2010 Web servers and Web Services.
Among the property values that can be managed using these settings is the TrustedCACerts property, which represents a collection of certification authorities trusted by Microsoft Lync 2010 Phone Edition.
Certificates obtained from trusted CAs allow these clients to create secure connections with Lync Server 2010 servers.
To add a new CA to the collection of trusted certification authorities, you must add the certificate chain for that CA in the local computer's certificate store.
After you have verified that the certificate chain has been installed, you can then use the New-CsWebTrustedCACertificate to create a certificate ID object that can be added to a collection of Web Services configuration settings.

Note that the certification authority that signs the default server certificate used when installing Lync Server 2010 is automatically trusted and does not need to be added to the TrustedCACerts property of a collection of Web Services configuration settings.
TrustedCACerts should only contain the identities of CAs that need to be trusted in addition to the CA that issued the default certificate.
In most cases, the CA that issued the default certificate will be the only certification authority that needs to be trusted.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsWebTrustedCACertificate cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself) run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsWebTrustedCACertificate"}

Web Services configuration settings are used to help manage Lync Server Web servers and Web Services.
Among the property values that can be managed using these settings is the TrustedCACerts property, which represents a collection of certification authorities trusted by Lync Phone Edition.
Certificates obtained from trusted CAs allow these clients to enhance the security of connections with servers running Lync Server.
To add a new CA to the collection of trusted certification authorities, you must add the certificate chain for that CA in the local computer's certificate store.
After you have verified that the certificate chain has been installed, you can then use the New-CsWebTrustedCACertificate to create a certificate ID object that can be added to a collection of Web Services configuration settings.

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Web Services configuration settings are used to help manage Skype for Business Server 2015 Web servers and Web Services.
Among the property values that can be managed using these settings is the TrustedCACerts property, which represents a collection of certification authorities trusted by Skype for Business Phone Edition.
Certificates obtained from trusted CAs allow these clients to enhance the security of connections with servers running Skype for Business Server 2015.
To add a new CA to the collection of trusted certification authorities, you must add the certificate chain for that CA in the local computer's certificate store.
After you have verified that the certificate chain has been installed, you can then use the New-CsWebTrustedCACertificate cmdlet to create a certificate ID object that can be added to a collection of Web Services configuration settings.

Note that the certification authority that signs the default server certificate used when installing Skype for Business Server 2015 is automatically trusted and does not need to be added to the TrustedCACerts property of a collection of Web Services configuration settings.
TrustedCACerts should only contain the identities of CAs that need to be trusted in addition to the CA that issued the default certificate.
In most cases, the CA that issued the default certificate will be the only certification authority that needs to be trusted.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
$x = New-CsWebTrustedCACertificate -Thumbprint "D543DFF74FEEA425162FD25F342786F1AB453BB3" -CAStore TrustedRootCA

Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -TrustedCACerts @{Add=$x}
```

The commands shown in Example 1 create a new trusted CA certificate and then add that certificate to the TrustedCACerts property of the Web Services configuration settings for the Redmond site.
To carry out this task, the first command in the example uses New-CsWebTrustedCACertificate to create a new trusted CA certificate; that certificate can be found in the Trusted Root certificate store and has the Thumbprint D543DFF74FEEA425162FD25F342786F1AB453BB3.
The resulting certificate object is stored in a variable named $x.

After the certificate object has been created, the second command in the example adds that certificate to the TrustedCACerts property.
To do this, the command uses the Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration cmdlet and the TrustedCACerts parameter.
The parameter value ${Add=$x} tells the cmdlet to add the certificate stored in the variable $x to the collection of trusted CA certificates.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The commands shown in Example 1 create a new trusted CA certificate and then add that certificate to the TrustedCACerts property of the Web Services configuration settings for the Redmond site.
To carry out this task, the first command in the example uses New-CsWebTrustedCACertificate to create a new trusted CA certificate; that certificate can be found in the Trusted Root certificate store and has the Thumbprint D543DFF74FEEA425162FD25F342786F1AB453BB3.
The resulting certificate object is stored in a variable named $x.

After the certificate object has been created, the second command in the example adds that certificate to the TrustedCACerts property.
To do this, the command uses the Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration cmdlet and the TrustedCACerts parameter.
The parameter value ${Add=$x} tells the cmdlet to add the certificate stored in the variable $x to the collection of trusted CA certificates.

$x = New-CsWebTrustedCACertificate -Thumbprint "D543DFF74FEEA425162FD25F342786F1AB453BB3" -CAStore TrustedRootCA

Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -TrustedCACerts @{Add=$x}
