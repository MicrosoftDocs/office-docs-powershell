 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are a series of standards and guidelines used by computers engaged in work for the United States government; for example, there are FIPS standards that govern the use of such things as cryptography, encryption, and digital signatures.
(See http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/by-num.htm (http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/by-num.htm) for more information.) Lync Server 2013 provides an option that enables the software to use only algorithms that meet the FIPS standards.
If you need to work with the United States government (or with other entities that follow FIPS) then you can enable FIPS compliance in Lync Server 2013.

Keep in mind, however, that, for the on-premises version of Lync Server, you have only a single, global collection of FIPS configuration settings: FIPS compliance can only be enabled or disabled for your entire Lync Server implementation.
You cannot selectively enable or disable FIPS compliance on, say, an individual site or an individual Registrar pool.
If you do enable FIPS compliance, you could potentially encounter problems when trying to communicate with organizations that do not fully adhere to the FIPS standards.

By default, FIPS compliance is disabled in Lync Server 2013 Preview.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsFIPSConfiguration

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 1 resets the properties in the global collection of FIPS configuration settings to their default values.

Remove-CsFIPSConfiguration -Identity "Global"

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 1 resets the properties in the global collection of FIPS configuration settings to their default values.

Remove-CsFIPSConfiguration -Identity "Global"

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Unique Identity of the FIPS configuration settings to be removed.
Because Lync Server 2013 Preview only supports a single, global collection of FIPS settings, the only collection that can be deleted is the global collection:

-Identity global

Note that, in this case, the global collection will not actually be removed from the system; Lync Server 2013 Preview does not support the deletion of the global settings.
Instead, the lone property in that collection - RequireFIPSCompliantMedia - will be reset to its default value of False.



**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Unique Identity of the FIPS configuration settings to be removed.
Because Skype for Business Server 2015 only supports a single, global collection of FIPS settings, the only collection that can be deleted is the global collection:

-Identity global

Note that, in this case, the global collection will not actually be removed from the system; Skype for Business Server 2015 does not support the deletion of the global settings.
Instead, the lone property in that collection - RequireFIPSCompliantMedia - will be reset to its default value of False.
