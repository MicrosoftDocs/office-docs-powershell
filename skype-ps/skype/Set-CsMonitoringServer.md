This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Set-CsMonitoringServer [[-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity>] [-MonitoringDatabase <String>]
 [-ReportingUrl <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

Monitoring Server provides you with two important capabilities.
For one, it enables you to maintain information about how, and how often, Enterprise Voice is used in your organization.
This information is tracked by using call detail recording (CDR), which records such things as who made a call, who that person called, and how long the call lasted.
(The actual conversation itself is not recorded.) In addition to that, you can also use Monitoring Server to keep track of Quality of Experience (QoE) data for your Enterprise Voice calls.
As the name implies, Quality of Experience data provides information about the quality of a call, measuring such items as packet loss, call degradation, network bitrate, and jitter.

When you install Monitoring Server you must specify the location of the SQL Server database used to store CDR and QoE data.
Optionally, you can also install SQL Server Reporting Services and the Monitoring Server Report Pack; these two items enable you to access a website that generates standard monitoring reports for you.

As a general rule, after Monitoring Server has been installed and configured you will not need to change the location of either the back-end database or the reporting URL.
However, if you do need to change the location of one (or both) of these items, you can do so by running the Set-CsMonitoringServer cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsMonitoringServer cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsMonitoringServer"}
