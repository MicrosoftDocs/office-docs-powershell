## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

This cmdlet returns a named voice normalization rule or a collection of voice normalization rules.
These rules are a required part of phone authorization and call routing.
They define the requirements for converting--or translating--numbers from an internal Lync Server 2010 format to a standard (E.164) format.
An understanding of regular expressions is helpful in order to define number patterns that will be translated.

The same rules accessed by this cmdlet can also be accessed through the NormalizationRules property returned by a call to the Get-CsDialPlan cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins, RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule"}

```

Example 2 retrieves all voice normalization rules specified for all sites.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 retrieves all voice normalization rules specified for all sites.

Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Filter site*

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 retrieves all voice normalization rules specified for all sites.

Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Filter site*

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Filter *s*
```

Example 3 retrieves all voice normalization rules with the letter s anywhere in the scope.
For example, this will return all site- and service-level rules, as well as per-user rules with an s in the scope name, such as RedmondEastUsers.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 retrieves all voice normalization rules with the letter s anywhere in the scope.
For example, this will return all site- and service-level rules, as well as per-user rules with an s in the scope name, such as RedmondEastUsers.

Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Filter *s*

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 3 retrieves all voice normalization rules with the letter s anywhere in the scope.
For example, this will return all site- and service-level rules, as well as per-user rules with an s in the scope name, such as RedmondEastUsers.

Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Filter *s*

### -------------------------- Example 4 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule | Where-Object {$_.Name -match "seattle"}
```

The Filter parameter used in Examples 2 and 3 matches only on the scope portion of the Identity.
This example performs a match on the name portion to return all rules with a Name containing the string "seattle".
To do this, we first call Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule to retrieve all the normalization rules for the organization.
We then pipe this collection to the Where-Object cmdlet to find all the items in the collection where the Name property matches the string "seattle".

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

A unique identifier for the rule.
If a value is specified for this parameter, it must be in the format scope/name; for example, site:Redmond/Rule1, where site:Redmond is the scope and Rule1 is the name.

### -Filter
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Uses wildcard strings to return a collection of normalization rules based on Identity.
Note that Filter works only on the scope portion of the Identity, not on the name.
For example, the filter value *lob* will return all rules at the global scope (scopes that contain the letters lob), but not a rule with the identity site:Redmond/lobby, where lob is only in the name portion of the identity, not the scope.
