# New-CsBlockedDomain

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Adds a new domain to the list of domains blocked for federation.
By definition, your users are not allowed to use Microsoft Lync Server 2010 applications to communicate with people from the blocked domain; for example, users cannot use Microsoft Lync 2010 to exchange instant messages with anyone with a SIP account in a domain that appears on the blocked list.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Adds a new domain to the list of domains blocked for federation.
By definition, your users are not allowed to use Lync Server applications to communicate with people from the blocked domain; for example, users cannot use Lync to exchange instant messages with anyone with a SIP account in a domain that appears on the blocked list.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Federation is a means by which two organizations can set up a trust relationship that facilitates communication between the two groups. 
When federation has been established, users in the two organizations can send each other instant messages, subscribe for presence notifications, and otherwise communicate with one another by using SIP applications such as Lync 2010.
Lync Server 2010 allows for three types of federation: 1) direct federation between your organization and another; 2) federation between your organization and a public provider; and, 3) federation between your organization and a third-party hosting provider.

Setting up direct federation with another organization involves several tasks.
To begin with, you must enable your servers running the Lync Server Access Edge service  to allow federation.
In addition, the other organization must enable federation with you; federation cannot be established unless both parties agree to the relationship.

To establish a federated relationship you might also need to manage two federation-related lists: the allowed list and the blocked list.
The allowed list represents the organizations you have chosen to federate with; if a domain appears on the allowed list then (depending on your configuration settings) your users will be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with users who have accounts in that federated domain.
Conversely, the blocked list represents domains that users are expressly forbidden from federating with; for example, messages sent from a blocked domain will automatically be rejected by Lync Server 2010.

The New-CsBlockedDomain cmdlet enables you to add a domain to the list of blocked domains.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsBlockedDomain cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsBlockedDomain"}

Federation is a means by which two organizations can set up a trust relationship that facilitates communication between the two groups.
When federation has been established, users in the two organizations can send each other instant messages, subscribe for presence notifications, and otherwise communicate with one another by using SIP applications such as Skype for Business.
Skype for Business Server 2015 allows for three types of federation: 1) direct federation between your organization and another; 2) federation between your organization and a public provider; and, 3) federation between your organization and a third-party hosting provider.

Setting up direct federation with another organization involves several tasks.
To begin with, you must enable your servers running the Skype for Business Server 2015 Access Edge service to allow federation.
In addition, the other organization must enable federation with you; federation cannot be established unless both parties agree to the relationship.

To establish a federated relationship you might also need to manage two federation-related lists: the allowed list and the blocked list.
The allowed list represents the organizations you have chosen to federate with; if a domain appears on the allowed list then (depending on your configuration settings) your users will be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with users who have accounts in that federated domain.
Conversely, the blocked list represents domains that users are expressly forbidden from federating with; for example, messages sent from a blocked domain will automatically be rejected by Skype for Business Server 2015.

The New-CsBlockedDomain cmdlet enables you to add a domain to the list of blocked domains.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsBlockedDomain -Identity "fabrikam.com" -Comment "Blocked per Ken Myer."
```

In the preceding example, the domain fabrikam.com is added to the list of blocked domains.
To do this, New-CsBlockedDomain is called, along with the Identity parameter, which is assigned the name of the domain to be blocked.
In addition, the Comment parameter is included in order to add a comment to the blocked domain.
Note that this command will fail if fabrikam.com is already on the blocked list or on the allowed list.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 1, the domain fabrikam.com is added to the list of blocked domains.
To do this, New-CsBlockedDomain is called, along with the Identity parameter, which is assigned the name of the domain to be blocked.
In addition, the Comment parameter is included in order to add a comment to the blocked domain.
Note that this command will fail if fabrikam.com is already on the blocked list or on the allowed list.

New-CsBlockedDomain -Identity "fabrikam.com" -Comment "Blocked per Ken Myer."

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 1, the domain fabrikam.com is added to the list of blocked domains.
To do this, the New-CsBlockedDomain cmdlet is called, along with the Identity parameter, which is assigned the name of the domain to be blocked.
In addition, the Comment parameter is included in order to add a comment to the blocked domain.
Note that this command will fail if fabrikam.com is already on the blocked list or on the allowed list.

New-CsBlockedDomain -Identity "fabrikam.com" -Comment "Blocked per Ken Myer."

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
$x = New-CsBlockedDomain -Identity "fabrikam.com" -InMemory
$x.Comment = "Blocked per Ken Myer."
Set-CsBlockedDomain -Instance $x
```

Example 2 demonstrates how you can use the InMemory parameter to create a new blocked domain that initially exists only in memory.
After you modify the property values of this in-memory-only domain you can then call Set-CsBlockedDomain to add the domain to the blocked list.

To perform this task, the first line in the command uses New-CsBlockedDomain and the InMemory parameter to create a blocked domain with the Identity fabrikam.com.
Upon creation, this virtual domain is stored in the variable $x.

In the second line, the Comment property of the virtual domain is modified.
After that, line 3 uses the Set-CsBlockedDomain cmdlet to add the virtual domain to the blocked list.
Without line 3, the virtual domain would exist only in memory and would never be added to the blocked list.
Instead, the virtual domain will disappear as soon as you end your Windows PowerShell session or delete the variable $x.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

After that, line 3 uses the Set-CsBlockedDomain cmdlet to add the virtual domain to the blocked list.
Without line 3, the virtual domain would exist only in memory and would never be added to the blocked list.
Instead, the virtual domain will disappear as soon as you end your Windows PowerShell session or delete the variable $x.

$x = New-CsBlockedDomain -Identity "fabrikam.com" -InMemory

$x.Comment = "Blocked per Ken Myer."

Set-CsBlockedDomain -Instance $x

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 demonstrates how you can use the InMemory parameter to create a new blocked domain that initially exists only in memory.
After you modify the property values of this in-memory-only domain you can then call the Set-CsBlockedDomain cmdlet to add the domain to the blocked list.

$x = New-CsBlockedDomain -Identity "fabrikam.com" -InMemory

$x.Comment = "Blocked per Ken Myer."

Set-CsBlockedDomain -Instance $x
