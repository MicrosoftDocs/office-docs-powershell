## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

The Remove-CsCallParkOrbit cmdlet deletes the call park orbit range with the name passed to the Identity parameter (this parameter is required).
Each call park orbit within an organization must have a unique range of numbers.
Removing a call park orbit frees up the range that was in that call park orbit.
The freed numbers can then be used in a newly defined call park orbit.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsCallParkOrbit cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

```

The command in this example removes all call park orbit ranges that have been defined for an organization.
