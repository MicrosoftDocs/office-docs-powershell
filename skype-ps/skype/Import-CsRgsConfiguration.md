The ability to export and import Response Group configuration data is particularly useful disaster recovery scenarios.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.



## SYNTAX

```
Import-CsRgsConfiguration -Destination <RgsIdentity> -FileName <String> [-Force] [-OverwriteOwner]
 [-ReplaceExistingRgsSettings] [-ResolveNameConflicts] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The Export-CsRgsConfiguration and Import-CsRgsConfiguration cmdlets enable you to export data about your current implementation of the Response Group application (including such things as workflows, queues, agent groups, holiday sets and business hours, as well as audio files and service configuration settings) and then later import (or re-import) that information.
This can be extremely useful in a disaster recovery scenario (for example, in a case where the server hosting the Response Group application has failed) or if you simply need to transfer the Response Group application to a different pool.

Note that the Export-CsRgsConfiguration and Import-CsRgsConfiguration cmdlets are designed to work only with Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview.
If you want to migrate Response Group data from Microsoft Lync Server 2010 to Lync Server 2013 Preview, you should use the Move-CsRgsConfiguration cmdlet instead.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Import-CsRgsConfiguration"}

Lync Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the Import-CsRgsConfiguration cmdlet are not available in the Lync Server Control Panel.
