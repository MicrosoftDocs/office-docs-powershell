# Invoke-CsUcsRollback

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Removes a user's contacts from the Unified Contact Store and, instead, stores that contact information in Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview.
The Unified Contact Store provides a way for users to maintain a single set of contacts that can be accessed using Lync 2013 Preview, Microsoft Outlook, and/or Microsoft Outlook Web Access.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013 Preview.

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Removes a user's contacts from the Unified Contact Store and, instead, stores that contact information in Skype for Business Server 2015.
The Unified Contact Store provides a way for users to maintain a single set of contacts that can be accessed using Skype for Business, Microsoft Outlook, and/or Microsoft Outlook Web Access.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.



## SYNTAX

```
Invoke-CsUcsRollback [-Identity] <UserIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-Force] [-PassThru]
 [-WhatIf] [-AsJob] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The unified contact store introduced in Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview gives administrators the option of storing a user's contacts in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Preview instead of in Lync Server; in turn that allows the user to access the same set of contacts in Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Web Access as well as in Microsoft Lync 2013 Preview.
(Alternatively, you can continue to store contacts in Lync Server.
In that case, users will have to maintain two separate sets of contacts: one for use with Outlook and Outlook Web Access, and one for use with Lync 2013 Preview.)

In order to take advantage of the unified contact store you must (among other things) assign the user a user services policy that enables the use of the unified contact store; if all the other prerequisites have been met, then the next time the user logs on using Lync Server 2013 Preview his or her contacts will automatically be moved from Lync Server to the unified contact store.
See the help topic for the Set-CsUserServicesPolicy cmdlet for more information.

If later decide to move those contacts back to Lync Server (and out of the unified contact store) then you need to do two things.
First, you must assign the user a new user services policy, one that prohibits the use of the unified contact store.
Second, you must use the Invoke-CsUcsRollback cmdlet to "manually" migrate the contacts from the unified contact store back to Lync Server.
Simply changing the user services policy will not remove the user's contacts from the unified contact store; that can only be done by calling Invoke-CsUcsRollback.

Note.
Technically, calling Invoke-CsUcsRollback by itself, without modifying the user services policy, will remove a user's contacts from the unified contact store.
However, this change will only be temporary: if you do not change the user services policy then, after a 7-day waiting period, the user's contacts will automatically be moved back into the unified contact store.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Invoke-CsUcsRollback"}

The unified contact store introduced in Skype for Business Server 2015 gives administrators the option of storing a user's contacts in Exchange instead of in Skype for Business Server 2015; in turn that allows the user to access the same set of contacts in Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Web Access as well as in Skype for Business.
(Alternatively, you can continue to store contacts in Skype for Business Server 2015.
In that case, users will have to maintain two separate sets of contacts: one for use with Outlook and Outlook Web Access, and one for use with Skype for Business Server 2015.)

In order to take advantage of the unified contact store you must (among other things) assign the user a user services policy that enables the use of the unified contact store; if all the other prerequisites have been met, then the next time the user logs on using Skype for Business Server 2015 his or her contacts will automatically be moved from Skype for Business Server 2015 to the unified contact store.
See the help topic for the Set-CsUserServicesPolicy cmdlet for more information.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 removes the user Ken Myer from the unified contact store.

Invoke-CsUcsRollback -Identity "Ken Myer"

### Example 1 (Skype for Business Online)
```
PS C:\> {{ Add example code here }}
```

{{ Add example description here }}

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 removes the user Ken Myer from the unified contact store.

Invoke-CsUcsRollback -Identity "Ken Myer"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, all the users homed on the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com are removed from the unified contact store.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsUser along with the Filter parameter; the filter value {RegistrarPool -eq "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} limits the returned data to users homed on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
Those user accounts are then piped to the Invoke-CsUcsRollback cmdlet, which removes each user from the unified contact store.
In order to suppress the confirmation prompt that would otherwise occur each time the cmdlet rolls back a user account, the Confirm parameter is included using this syntax:-Confirm:$False

Get-CsUser -Filter {RegistrarPool -eq "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} | Invoke-CsUcsRollback -Confirm:$False

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, all the users homed on the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com are removed from the unified contact store.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsUser cmdlet along with the Filter parameter; the filter value {RegistrarPool -eq "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} limits the returned data to users homed on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
Those user accounts are then piped to the Invoke-CsUcsRollback cmdlet, which removes each user from the unified contact store.
In order to suppress the confirmation prompt that would otherwise occur each time the cmdlet rolls back a user account, the Confirm parameter is included using this syntax:-Confirm:$False

Get-CsUser -Filter {RegistrarPool -eq "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} | Invoke-CsUcsRollback -Confirm:$False

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Indicates the Identity of the user account to be rolled back.
User Identities are typically specified using one of four formats: 1) the user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (for example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).

You can also reference a user account by using the user's Active Directory distinguished name.

You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
For example, the Identity "* Smith" returns all the users who have a display name that ends with the string value " Smith".
