## SYNTAX

```
Import-CsDeviceUpdate [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> -FileName <String> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Periodically, Microsoft releases a new set of device update rules for Lync 2010 Phone Edition.
These rules represent firmware updates for devices that run Lync 2010 Phone Edition.
After these rules have been imported, administrators can test the firmware updates and then, assuming the tests succeed, can make the updates available to all the relevant devices used in the organization.

The only way to create new update rules is to download update packs from Microsoft; you cannot create your own device update rules.
To obtain the latest set of device update rules, go to the Help and Support page on Microsoft.com and search for "Phone Edition".
Download the update package and extract the files to a folder on the computer where the updates are to be uploaded.
After the files have been extracted, you can then use the Import-CsDeviceUpdate cmdlet to import the device update rules found in the extracted .CAB file (which will have the name UCUpdates.cab).

As noted, updates can only be loaded locally; you will need to copy UCUpdates.cab to any computer running the Web Services service that needs to host device update rules.
Keep in mind as well that device update rules are not replicated from server-to-server.
If you want all the device update rules throughout your organization to remain in sync you will need to perform the same operation on each server hosting these rules.
For example, if you remove a rule from one Web Services server you will then need to remove that same rule from your other Web Services servers.
Otherwise, your device update rules will no longer be in sync.

Update rules can only be imported to services; they are not applicable at the global, site, or per-user scopes.
Note, however, that Import-CsDeviceUpdate does not automatically add rules and updates to every service in a site; instead, it loads those rules and updates only to the specified service.
For example, if you have three servers in a site running Web Services, you will need to run Import-CsDeviceUpdate three times, one for each instance of Web Services.
Alternatively, you can use a command like the one shown in Example 3; this one command retrieves the Identity of all your   servers Web Services and then runs Import-CsDeviceUpdate against each of those servers.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Import-CsDeviceUpdate cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "Import-CsDeviceUpdate"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Import-CsDeviceUpdate -Identity "service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -FileName C:\Updates\UCUpdates.cab
```

The command shown in Example 1 imports device update rules from the file C:\Updates\UCUpdates.cab.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 imports device update rules from the file C:\Updates\UCUpdates.cab.

Import-CsDeviceUpdate -Identity "service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -FileName C:\Updates\UCUpdates.cab

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 imports device update rules from the file C:\Updates\UCUpdates.cab.

Import-CsDeviceUpdate -Identity "service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -FileName C:\Updates\UCUpdates.cab

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Import-CsDeviceUpdate -Identity "service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -FileName \\atl-fs-001\Updates\UCUpdates.cab
```

The command shown in Example 2 imports device update rules from the UNC path \\\\atl-fs-001\Updates\UCUpdates.cab.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 imports device update rules from the UNC path \\\\atl-fs-001\Updates\UCUpdates.cab.

Import-CsDeviceUpdate -Identity "service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -FileName \\\\atl-fs-001\Updates\UCUpdates.cab

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 imports device update rules from the UNC path \\\\atl-fs-001\Updates\UCUpdates.cab.

Import-CsDeviceUpdate -Identity "service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -FileName \\\\atl-fs-001\Updates\UCUpdates.cab

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsService -WebServer | ForEach-Object {Import-CsDeviceUpdate -Identity $_.Identity -FileName C:\Updates\UCUpdates.cab}
```

Example 3 shows how you can use a single command to import device update rules to all your servers running Web Services.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsService, along with the WebServer parameter, in order to return a collection of all of your servers running the Web Services service.
This collection is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which loops through each server in the collection and uses Import-CsDeviceUpdate to update the latest device update rules to those servers.
Note that this command will work only if you have copied UCUpdates.cab to the same location (C:\Updates) on all your servers.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 shows how you can use a single command to import device update rules to all your servers running Web Services.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsService, along with the WebServer parameter, in order to return a collection of all of your servers running the Web Services service.
This collection is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which loops through each server in the collection and uses Import-CsDeviceUpdate to update the latest device update rules to those servers.
Note that this command will work only if you have copied UCUpdates.cab to the same location (C:\Updates) on all your servers.

Get-CsService -WebServer | ForEach-Object {Import-CsDeviceUpdate -Identity $_.Identity -FileName C:\Updates\UCUpdates.cab}

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 3 shows how you can use a single command to import device update rules to all your servers running Web Services.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsService cmdlet, along with the WebServer parameter, in order to return a collection of all of your servers running the Web Services service.
