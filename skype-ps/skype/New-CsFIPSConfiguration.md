## SYNTAX

```
New-CsFIPSConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Confirm] [-Force] [-InMemory]
 [-RequireFIPSCompliantMedia <Boolean>] [-Tenant <Guid>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are a series of standards and guidelines used by computers engaged in work for the United States government; for example, there are FIPS standards that govern the use of such things as cryptography, encryption, and digital signatures.
(See http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/by-num.htm (http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/by-num.htm) for more information.) Lync Server 2013 provides an option that enables the software to use only algorithms that meet the FIPS standards.
If you need to work with the United States government (or with other entities that follow FIPS) then you can enable FIPS compliance in Lync Server 2013.

Keep in mind, however, that, for the on-premises version of Lync Server, you have only a single, global collection of FIPS configuration settings: FIPS compliance can only be enabled or disabled for your entire Lync Server implementation.
You cannot selectively enable or disable FIPS compliance on, say, an individual site or an individual Registrar pool.
If you do enable FIPS compliance, you could potentially encounter problems when trying to communicate with organizations that do not fully adhere to the FIPS standards.
That means that the New-CsFIPSConfiguration cmdlet is primarily used to manage FIPS compliance for Office 365 tenants.

By default, FIPS compliance is disabled in Lync Server 2013 Preview.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsFIPSConfiguration"}

Lync Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the New-CsFIPSConfiguration cmdlet are not available in the Lync Server Control Panel.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The commands shown in Example 1 create a new, in-memory-only set of FIPS configuration settings and then later use these settings to update the global collection of FIPS configuration settings.
In order to do this, the first command in the example uses New-CsFIPSConfiguration and the InMemory parameter to create a new collection of FIPS configurations settings with the Identity "global"; the resulting settings object is stored in a variable named $x.

In the second command, the Set-CsFIPSConfiguration cmdlet and the Instance parameter are then used to replace the existing global collection of FIPS settings with the new collection stored in $x.

Although this example works, it is easier to modify FIPS configuration settings by using the Set-CsFIPSConfiguration cmdlet.

$x = New-CsFIPSConfiguration -Identity "global" -RequireFIPSCompliantMedia $False -InMemory

Set-CsFIPSConfiguration -Instance $x

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Unique identifier for the new collection of FIPS configuration settings.
Because Lync Server 2013 Preview only supports a single, global collection of FIPS settings, the only way you can use this parameter is to create a "new" global collection that exists only in memory.
You will also need to use the InMemory parameter in order to do that.

Unique identifier for the new collection of FIPS configuration settings.
Because Skype for Business Server 2015 only supports a single, global collection of FIPS settings, the only way you can use this parameter is to create a "new" global collection that exists only in memory.
You will also need to use the InMemory parameter in order to do that.

### -RequireFIPSCompliantMedia
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

When set to True, Lync Server 2013 Preview will only allow media sessions with entities that use FIPS compliant algorithms for authentication and authorization.
