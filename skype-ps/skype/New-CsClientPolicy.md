# New-CsClientPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Creates a new client policy.
Among other things, client policies help determine the features of Microsoft Lync 2010 that are made available to users; for example, you might give some users the right to transfer files while denying this right to other users.

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

In Lync Server 2010, client policies replace the Group Policy settings used in previous versions of the product.
In Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 and Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2, Group Policy helped determine what users could do with Communicator and other clients; for example, there were Group Policy settings that determined whether or not users could save a transcript of their instant messaging sessions; whether information from Microsoft Outlook was incorporated into their presence information; and whether or not users could include emoticons or formatted text in instant messages.

As useful as Group Policy is, however, the technology does have some limitations when applied to Lync Server 2010.
For one thing, Group Policy is designed to be applied on a per-domain or per-organizational unit (OU) basis, which makes it difficult to target policies toward a more select group of users (for example, all the users who work in a particular department, or all the users who have a particular job title).
For another, Group Policy is only applied to users who log on to the domain and who log on using a computer; Group Policy is not applied to users who access Lync Server 2010 over the Internet or who access the system by using a mobile phone.
This means that the same user can have a different experience depending on the device he or she uses to log on, and where he or she logs on from.

To help address these inconsistencies, Lync Server 2010 uses client policies instead of Group Policy.
Client policies are applied each time a user accesses the system, regardless of where the user logs on from and regardless of the type of device the user logs on with.
In addition, client policies, like other Lync Server 2010 policies, can readily be targeted towards selected groups of users.
You can even create a custom policy that gets assigned to a single user.

The New-CsClientPolicy cmdlet enables you to create new client policies at either the site or the per-user scope.
Note that any given site can have, at most, a single client policy; if you try to create a policy for the Redmond site and that site already hosts a client policy, your command will fail.
Likewise, your command will fail if you try to create a new client policy at the global scope because the global scope already contains a client policy.
If you need to make changes to the global policy, use the Set-CsClientPolicy cmdlet instead.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsClientPolicy cmdlet: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsClientPolicy"}

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Client policies are applied each time a user accesses the system, regardless of where the user logs on from and regardless of the type of device the user logs on with.
In addition, client policies, like other Skype for Business Server 2015 policies, can readily be targeted toward selected groups of users.
You can even create a custom policy that gets assigned to a single user.

The New-CsClientPolicy cmdlet enables you to create new client policies at either the site or the per-user scope.
Note that any given site can have, at most, a single client policy; if you try to create a policy for the Redmond site and that site already hosts a client policy, your command will fail.
Likewise, your command will fail if you try to create a new client policy at the global scope because the global scope already contains a client policy.
If you need to make changes to the global policy, use the Set-CsClientPolicy cmdlet instead.

Keep in mind that client policies differ from many other policies in that most of the policy settings do not have default values.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsClientPolicy -Identity RedmondClientPolicy -DisableCalendarPresence $True -DisablePhonePresence $True -DisplayPhoto "PhotosFromADOnly"
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new client policy with the Identity RedmondClientPolicy.
In addition to specifying the Identity, this command also includes three optional parameters and their parameter values: DisableCalendarPresence, DisablePhonePresence, and DisplayPhoto.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new client policy with the Identity RedmondClientPolicy.
In addition to specifying the Identity, this command also includes three optional parameters and their parameter values: DisableCalendarPresence, DisablePhonePresence, and DisplayPhoto.

New-CsClientPolicy -Identity RedmondClientPolicy -DisableCalendarPresence $True -DisablePhonePresence $True -DisplayPhoto "PhotosFromADOnly"

### Example 1 (Skype for Business Online)
```
PS C:\> {{ Add example code here }}
```

{{ Add example description here }}

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new client policy with the Identity RedmondClientPolicy.
In addition to specifying the Identity, this command also includes three optional parameters and their parameter values: DisableCalendarPresence, DisablePhonePresence, and DisplayPhoto.

New-CsClientPolicy -Identity RedmondClientPolicy -DisableCalendarPresence $True -DisablePhonePresence $True -DisplayPhoto "PhotosFromADOnly"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
$x = New-CsClientPolicy -Identity RedmondClientPolicy -InMemory
$x.DisableCalendarPresence = $True 
$x.DisablePhonePresence = $True 
$x.DisplayPhoto = "PhotosFromADOnly"
Set-CsClientPolicy -Instance $x
```

Example 2 also creates a new client policy with the Identity RedmondClientPolicy; the difference between these commands and the command used in Example 1 is that, in Example 2, the new policy is created in memory only, and is only later turned into an actual client policy.
To do this, New-CsClientPolicy is first called along with two parameters: Identity (to specify the Identity for the new policy), and InMemory, which specifies that the new policy should be created in memory only and not immediately put into use.
Because this policy is created in memory only, it must be stored in a variable; in this example, that's a variable named $x.

After the virtual policy has been created, the next three commands are used to modify properties for this virtual policy; for example, command 2 sets the value of the DisableCalendarPresence property to True ($True).
After all the desired modifications have been made, the final command uses Set-CsClientPolicy to turn this virtual policy into an actual client policy that can be assigned to users.
Note that this final command is critical.
If you do not call Set-CsClientPolicy the policy RedmondClientPolicy will not be created, and the virtual policy will disappear as soon as you end your Windows PowerShell session or delete the variable $x.

### -SearchPrefixFlags
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Represents the Address Book attributes that should be used any time a user searches for a new contact.
The search prefix flags are constructed as a binary number like 11101111, in which a 1 indicates that the attribute should be searched and a 0 indicates that the attribute should not be searched.
The attributes in the binary value are (from right to left):

Primary email address

Email alias

All email addresses

Company

Display name

First name

Last name

The binary value 1110111 means that all attributes should be searched except attribute 4: Company.
To search only last name, first name, and display name you would construct this value:

1110000

After the binary value has been constructed, it must then be converted to a decimal value before being assigned to SearchPrefixFlags.
To convert a binary number to a decimal number, you can use the a Windows PowerShell command similar to this:

\[Convert\]::ToInt32("1110111", 2)
