# Set-CsAccessEdgeConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Modifies the property values of an existing collection of Access Edge configuration settings for computers running the Access Edge service.

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Edge servers (also known as access proxy servers) provide a way for you to extend the capabilities of Microsoft Lync Server 2010 to people who are not logged on to your internal network.
For example, if you have remote users, authenticated users who log on to Lync Server over the Internet rather than through the internal network, you will need to set up an Edge server in order to provide access to these users.
Likewise, Edge Servers are required if you want to establish federation with another organization, or if you want to give your users the right to communicate with people who have accounts with a public instant messaging service such as Yahoo!, AOL, or MSN.
Access Edge servers are located on the perimeter network, and are used to make and validate SIP connections between users inside and users outside your internal network.

In Lync Server 2010, the Access Edge servers are managed using a single, global collection of configuration settings; the Set-CsAccessEdgeConfiguration cmdlet enables you to modify these global settings.
Note that the properties that can be modified depend on the routing type you choose for your Edge Servers.
For example, if you choose to use Domain Name System (DNS) service routing, you will see and be able to change the property values BeClearinghouse and EnablePartnerDiscovery.
If you use default routing, those two property values will not be available.
Instead, you will see and be able to change the property values VerificationLevel and IsPublicProvider.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsAccessEdgeConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control RBAC roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsAccessEdgeConfiguration"}
