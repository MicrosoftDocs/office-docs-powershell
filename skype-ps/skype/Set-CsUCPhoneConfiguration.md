## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Lync 2010 Phone Edition represents the merging of the telephone and Microsoft Lync 2010.
Lync 2010 Phone Edition uses special hardware (that is, a Lync 2010-compatible telephone) that can function as a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone.
In addition, this hardware can also act as a Lync 2010-like endpoint: you can set your current status; check the status of your Lync 2010 contacts; search for new contacts; and carry out many of the other activities you are used to doing with Lync 2010.

The CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlets enable you to use configuration settings to manage phones running Lync 2010 Phone Edition.
For example, you can control such things as the minimum length of the personal identification number (PIN) used to log on to the phone and whether or not the phone will automatically lock itself after a specified period of inactivity.

Unified communications (UC) phone configuration settings can be applied at either the global scope or at the site scope.
When you first install Lync Server, a single set of UC phone configuration settings is created and applied at the global scope.
However, at any time after that you can use the New-CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlet to create a collection of settings that are applied at the site scope.
This lets you tailor UC phone management to the unique needs of each individual site.

In addition to creating new collections of UC phone settings, you can use the Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlet to modify the property values of an existing collection.
For example, by default logging is disabled for UC phones.
To enable logging at the global level, you can use Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration to change the value of the global collection's LoggingLevel property to True.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration"}

UC phones represent the merging of the telephone and Skype for Business Server 2015.
UC phones use special hardware (that is, a Skype for Business-compatible telephone) that can function as a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone.
In addition, this hardware can also act as a Skype for Business-like endpoint: you can set your current status; check the status of your Skype for Business contacts; search for new contacts; and carry out many of the other activities you are used to doing with Skype for Business.

The CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlets enable you to use configuration settings to manage phones running Skype for Business.
For example, you can control such things as the minimum length of the personal identification number (PIN) used to log on to the phone and whether or not the phone will automatically lock itself after a specified period of inactivity.

Unified communications (UC) phone configuration settings can be applied at either the global scope or at the site scope.
When you first install Skype for Business Server 2015, a single set of UC phone configuration settings is created and applied at the global scope.
However, at any time after that you can use the New-CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlet to create a collection of settings that are applied at the site scope.
This lets you tailor UC phone management to the unique needs of each individual site.

In addition to creating new collections of UC phone settings, you can use the Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlet to modify the property values of an existing collection.
For example, by default logging is disabled for UC phones.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Identity global -SIPSecurityMode "Medium"
```

The command shown in Example 1 sets the SIP security mode of the global UC phone settings to Medium.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 sets the SIP security mode of the global UC phone settings to Medium.

Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Identity global -SIPSecurityMode "Medium"

### Example 1 (Skype for Business Online)
```
PS C:\> {{ Add example code here }}
```

{{ Add example description here }}

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 sets the SIP security mode of the global UC phone settings to Medium.

Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Identity global -SIPSecurityMode "Medium"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -PhoneLockTimeout "00:30:00"
```

The preceding command modifies the UC phone settings configured for the Redmond site.
In this case, the PhoneLockTimeout property is set to 30 minutes; this is done by including the PhoneLockTimeout parameter and the parameter value "00:30:00" (00 hours: 30 minutes: 00 seconds).

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 modifies the UC phone settings configured for the Redmond site.
In this case, the PhoneLockTimeout property is set to 30 minutes; this is done by including the PhoneLockTimeout parameter and the parameter value "00:30:00" (00 hours: 30 minutes: 00 seconds).

Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -PhoneLockTimeout "00:30:00"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 modifies the UC phone settings configured for the Redmond site.
In this case, the PhoneLockTimeout property is set to 30 minutes; this is done by including the PhoneLockTimeout parameter and the parameter value "00:30:00" (00 hours: 30 minutes: 00 seconds).

Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -PhoneLockTimeout "00:30:00"

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Filter "site:*" | Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -PhoneLockTimeout "00:30:00"
```

Example 3 is a variation of the command shown in Example 2.
This time, however, the PhoneLockTimeout property is modified for all the UC phone settings configured at the site scope.
To do this, the command starts off by calling Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration; the Filter parameter and the filter value "site:*" limit the returned data to phone settings configured at the site scope.
This filtered collection is then piped to Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration, which uses the PhoneLockTimeout parameter and the parameter value "00:30:00" (00 hours: 30 minutes: 00 seconds) to set the phone lock timeout value for each item in the collection to 30 minutes.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 is a variation of the command shown in Example 2.
This time, however, the PhoneLockTimeout property is modified for all the UC phone settings configured at the site scope.
To do this, the command starts off by calling Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration; the Filter parameter and the filter value "site:*" limit the returned data to phone settings configured at the site scope.
This filtered collection is then piped to Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration, which uses the PhoneLockTimeout parameter and the parameter value "00:30:00" (00 hours: 30 minutes: 00 seconds) to set the phone lock timeout value for each item in the collection to 30 minutes.

Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Filter "site:*" | Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -PhoneLockTimeout "00:30:00"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 3 is a variation of the command shown in Example 2.
This time, however, the PhoneLockTimeout property is modified for all the UC phone settings configured at the site scope.
To do this, the command starts off by calling the Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlet; the Filter parameter and the filter value "site:*" limit the returned data to phone settings configured at the site scope.
This filtered collection is then piped to the Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlet, which uses the PhoneLockTimeout parameter and the parameter value "00:30:00" (00 hours: 30 minutes: 00 seconds) to set the phone lock timeout value for each item in the collection to 30 minutes.

Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Filter "site:*" | Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -PhoneLockTimeout "00:30:00"

### -------------------------- Example 4 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.SIPSecurityMode -ne "High"} | Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -EnforcePhoneLock $True -PhoneLockTimeout "00:30:00"
```

The preceding command configures the EnforcePhoneLock and the PhoneLockTimeout properties for all the UC phone settings where the SIP security mode is set to either Low or Medium.
To perform this task, the command first uses Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration to return all the UC phone configuration settings in the organization; this information is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those settings where the SIPSecurityMode property is not equal to High.
(Because SIP security can only be set to Low, Medium, or High, this clause will select all the settings where SIPSecurityMode is set to either Low or Medium.) The filtered collection is then piped to Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration, which uses the EnforcePhoneLock and the PhoneLockTimeout parameters to modify the phone locking and phone lock timeout properties.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 4 configures the EnforcePhoneLock and the PhoneLockTimeout properties for all the UC phone settings where the SIP security mode is set to either Low or Medium.
To perform this task, the command first uses Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration to return all the UC phone configuration settings in the organization; this information is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those settings where the SIPSecurityMode property is not equal to High.
(Because SIP security can only be set to Low, Medium, or High, this clause will select all the settings where SIPSecurityMode is set to either Low or Medium.) The filtered collection is then piped to Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration, which uses the EnforcePhoneLock and the PhoneLockTimeout parameters to modify the phone locking and phone lock timeout properties.

Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.SIPSecurityMode -ne "High"} | Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -EnforcePhoneLock $True -PhoneLockTimeout "00:30:00"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 4 configures the EnforcePhoneLock and the PhoneLockTimeout properties for all the UC phone settings where the SIP security mode is set to either Low or Medium.
To perform this task, the command first uses the Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlet to return all the UC phone configuration settings in the organization; this information is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those settings where the SIPSecurityMode property is not equal to High.
(Because SIP security can only be set to Low, Medium, or High, this clause will select all the settings where SIPSecurityMode is set to either Low or Medium.) The filtered collection is then piped to the Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlet, which uses the EnforcePhoneLock and the PhoneLockTimeout parameters to modify the phone locking and phone lock timeout properties.

Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.SIPSecurityMode -ne "High"} | Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -EnforcePhoneLock $True -PhoneLockTimeout "00:30:00"

### -------------------------- Example 5 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.PhoneLockTimeout -lt "00:10:00"} | Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -PhoneLockTimeout "00:10:00"
```

In Example 5, the phone lock timeout value is set to 10 minutes for all the UC phone settings where the PhoneLockTimeout property is currently less than 10 minutes.
(In effect, this makes 10 minutes the minimum phone lock timeout for the entire organization.) To do this, the command first uses Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration to return a collection of all the UC phone settings currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to Where-Object, which picks out only those settings where the PhoneLockTimeout property is less than  10 minutes (00 hours: 10 minutes: 00 seconds).
In turn, the filtered collection is piped to Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration, which sets the PhoneLockTimeout value for each item in the collection to 10 minutes.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 5 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 5, the phone lock timeout value is set to 10 minutes for all the UC phone settings where the PhoneLockTimeout property is currently less than 10 minutes.
(In effect, this makes 10 minutes the minimum phone lock timeout for the entire organization.) To do this, the command first uses Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration to return a collection of all the UC phone settings currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to Where-Object, which picks out only those settings where the PhoneLockTimeout property is less than 10 minutes (00 hours: 10 minutes: 00 seconds).
In turn, the filtered collection is piped to Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration, which sets the PhoneLockTimeout value for each item in the collection to 10 minutes.

Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.PhoneLockTimeout -lt "00:10:00"} | Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -PhoneLockTimeout "00:10:00"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 5 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 5, the phone lock timeout value is set to 10 minutes for all the UC phone settings where the PhoneLockTimeout property is currently less than 10 minutes.
(In effect, this makes 10 minutes the minimum phone lock timeout for the entire organization.) To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlet to return a collection of all the UC phone settings currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those settings where the PhoneLockTimeout property is less than 10 minutes (00 hours: 10 minutes: 00 seconds).
In turn, the filtered collection is piped to the Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration cmdlet, which sets the PhoneLockTimeout value for each item in the collection to 10 minutes.

Get-CsUCPhoneConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.PhoneLockTimeout -lt "00:10:00"} | Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -PhoneLockTimeout "00:10:00"
