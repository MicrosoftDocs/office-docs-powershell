## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Microsoft Lync Server 2010 works with Exchange UM to provide several voice-related capabilities, including Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access.
When Exchange UM is provided as a hosted service (rather than on-premises), contact objects must be created by using Windows PowerShell to apply the Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access functionality.
Any of the objects that are created can be removed with the Remove-CsExUmContact cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsExUmContact cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins.
To return a list of all the rule-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsExUmContact"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Remove-CsExUmContact -Identity sip:exumsa1@fabrikam.com
```

This example removes the Exchange UM contact with the SIP address exumsa1@fabrikam.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example removes the Exchange UM contact with the SIP address exumsa1@fabrikam.com.

Remove-CsExUmContact -Identity sip:exumsa1@fabrikam.com

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example removes the Exchange UM contact with the SIP address exumsa1@fabrikam.com.

Remove-CsExUmContact -Identity sip:exumsa1@fabrikam.com

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsExUmContact -Filter {LineURI -like "tel:425*"} | Remove-CsExUmContact
```

This example removes all Exchange UM contacts with LineURI values beginning with tel:425.
The first part of this command calls the Get-CsExUmContact cmdlet with the Filter parameter, using this expression as the filter: LineURI -like "tel:425*".
That filter specifies that we want to retrieve the Exchange UM contact objects that have a LineURI matching the wildcard string tel:425*.
In other words, all line URIs that start with the string tel:425 and end with any set of characters.
Once we have that collection of objects, we pipe the collection to the Remove-CsExUmContact cmdlet, which removes all the items in the collection.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```
