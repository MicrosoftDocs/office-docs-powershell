# Set-CsUserServicesPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Modifies an existing User Services policy.
User Services policies determine whether or not a user's contacts are stored in Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview or in the Unified Contact Store.
The Unified Contact Store provides a way for users to maintain a single set of contacts that can be accessed using Microsoft Lync 2013 Preview, Microsoft Outlook, and/or Microsoft Outlook Web Access.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013 Preview.

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The unified contact store introduced in Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview gives administrators the option of storing a user's contacts in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Preview instead of in Lync Server; in turn that allows the user to access the same set of contacts in Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Web Access as well as in Microsoft Lync 2013 Preview.
(Alternatively, you can continue to store contacts in Lync Server 2013 Preview.
In that case, users will have to maintain two separate sets of contacts: one for use with Outlook and Outlook Web Access, and one for use with Lync 2013 Preview.)

In order to take advantage of the unified contact store you must (among other things) assign the user a user services policy that enables the use of the unified contact store.
User service policies (which can be configured at the global, site, or the per-user scope) contain only a single property: UcsAllowed.
When this property is set to True then (assuming all the other prerequisites have been met) the next time a user logs on to Lync Server 2013 Preview his or her contacts will automatically be migrated to the unified contact store.

If this property is set to False this automatic migration will not take place.
However, simply setting UcsAllowed will not cause a user's contacts to be moved from the unified contact store back to Lync Server.
In order to do that, you must first assign the user a user services policy that does not allow the use of the unified contact store.
After that, you must then use the Invoke-UcsRollback cmdlet to "manually" migrate the contacts from the unified contact store back to Lync Server.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsUserServicesPolicy"}

The unified contact store introduced in Lync Server 2013 gives administrators the option of storing a user's contacts in Exchange instead of in Skype for Business Server 2015; in turn that allows the user to access the same set of contacts in Outlook and Outlook Web Access as well as.
(Alternatively, you can continue to store contacts in Skype for Business Server 2015.
In that case, users will have to maintain two separate sets of contacts: one for use with Outlook and Outlook Web Access, and one for use with Skype for Business.)

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 disables the use of the Unified Contact Store for the per-user User Services policy RedmondUserServicesPolicy.
This means that users managed by this policy will not have their contacts stored in the Unified Contact Store.

Set-CsUserServicesPolicy -Identity "RedmondUserServicesPolicy" -UcsAllowed $False

### Example 1 (Skype for Business Online)
```
PS C:\> {{ Add example code here }}
```

{{ Add example description here }}

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 disables the use of the Unified Contact Store for the per-user User Services policy RedmondUserServicesPolicy.
This means that users managed by this policy will not have their contacts stored in the Unified Contact Store.

Set-CsUserServicesPolicy -Identity "RedmondUserServicesPolicy" -UcsAllowed $False

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, all the User Services policies configured at the site scope are modified to disable the use of the Unified Contact Store.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsUserServicesPolicy and the Filter parameter to return a collection of all the policies configured at the site scope.
This collection is then piped to the Set-CsUserServicesPolicy cmdlet, which takes each policy in the collection and sets the UcsAllowed property to False ($False).

Get-CsUserServicesPolicy -Filter "site:*" | Set-CsUserServicesPolicy -UcsAllowed $False

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, all the User Services policies configured at the site scope are modified to disable the use of the Unified Contact Store.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsUserServicesPolicy cmdlet and the Filter parameter to return a collection of all the policies configured at the site scope.
This collection is then piped to the Set-CsUserServicesPolicy cmdlet, which takes each policy in the collection and sets the UcsAllowed property to False ($False).

Get-CsUserServicesPolicy -Filter "site:*" | Set-CsUserServicesPolicy -UcsAllowed $False
