# New-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Creates a new collection of dial-in conferencing configuration settings.
These settings determine how Microsoft Lync Server 2010 responds when users join or leave a dial-in conference.
In particular, information is returned regarding whether or not participants are required to record their name when joining a conference, and how (or if) the system announces that someone has joined or left the call.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Creates a new collection of dial-in conferencing configuration settings.
These settings determine how Lync Server responds when users join or leave a dial-in conference.
In particular, information is returned regarding whether or not participants are required to record their name when joining a conference, and how (or if) the system announces that someone has joined or left the call.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

When users join (or leave) a dial-in conference, Lync Server 2010 can respond in different ways.
For example, participants might be asked to record their name before they can enter the conference.
Likewise, administrators can decide whether they want to have Lync Server announce that dial-in participants have either left or joined a conference.

These conference "join behaviors" are managed using dial-in conferencing configuration settings; these settings can be configured at the global scope or at the site scope.
(Settings configured at the site scope take precedence over settings configured at the global scope.) When you first install Lync Server, the only dial-in conferencing configuration settings you will have are the ones at the global scope; however, you can create new settings at the site scope by using the New-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EnableNameRecording $False
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of dial-in conferencing configuration settings that are applied to the Redmond site.
In addition, the optional parameter EnableNameRecording is included in order to set the EnableNameRecording property to False.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of dial-in conferencing configuration settings that are applied to the Redmond site.
In addition, the optional parameter EnableNameRecording is included in order to set the EnableNameRecording property to False.

New-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EnableNameRecording $False

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of dial-in conferencing configuration settings that are applied to the Redmond site.
In addition, the optional parameter EnableNameRecording is included in order to set the EnableNameRecording property to False.

New-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EnableNameRecording $False

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
$x = New-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -InMemory
$x.EnableNameRecording = $False
Set-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration -Instance $x
```

In Example 2 the InMemory parameter is used to create a new collection of dial-in conferencing configuration settings that initially exist only in memory.
To do this, the example first calls New-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration, and the InMemory parameter to create a virtual settings collection that is stored in the variable $x.
(Note that this collection is given the Identity site:Redmond.) After creating the virtual collection, line 2 is used to modify the value of the  EnableNameRecording property.
Finally, line 3 in the example calls Set-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration to transform the virtual configuration settings stored in $x into an actual collection of settings applied to the Redmond site.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2 the InMemory parameter is used to create a new collection of dial-in conferencing configuration settings that initially exist only in memory.
To do this, the example first calls New-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration, and the InMemory parameter to create a virtual settings collection that is stored in the variable $x.
(Note that this collection is given the Identity site:Redmond.) After creating the virtual collection, line 2 is used to modify the value of the EnableNameRecording property.
Finally, line 3 in the example calls Set-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration to transform the virtual configuration settings stored in $x into an actual collection of settings applied to the Redmond site.

$x = New-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -InMemory

$x.EnableNameRecording = $False

Set-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration -Instance $x

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2 the InMemory parameter is used to create a new collection of dial-in conferencing configuration settings that initially exist only in memory.
To do this, the example first calls the New-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration cmdlet, and the InMemory parameter to create a virtual settings collection that is stored in the variable $x.
(Note that this collection is given the Identity site:Redmond.) After creating the virtual collection, line 2 is used to modify the value of the EnableNameRecording property.
Finally, line 3 in the example calls the Set-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration cmdlet to transform the virtual configuration settings stored in $x into an actual collection of settings applied to the Redmond site.

$x = New-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -InMemory

$x.EnableNameRecording = $False

Set-CSDialInConferencingConfiguration -Instance $x

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Indicates the Identity of the dial-in conferencing configuration settings to be created.
Because these settings can only be created at the site scope, use syntax similar to this, with the prefix "site:" followed by the name of the site: -Identity site:Redmond.

Note that there can only be one set of dial-in conferencing configuration settings per site.
The sample command will fail if a collection of settings with the Identity site:Redmond already exists.
