## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Many Lync Server 2010 components run as standard Windows services; for example, the Conferencing Attendant application is actually a service named RTCCAA.
If one of your Lync Server services is currently stopped, you can restart that service by using the Start-CsWindowsService cmdlet.

Note, however, that Start-CsWindowsService can only start Lync Server services; an error will occur if you attempt to start a non-Lync Server service (such as the print spooler) using this cmdlet.

Functionally, Start-CsWindowsService is very similar to the generic Windows PowerShell cmdlet Start-Service; if you want, you could also use Start-Service to start a Lync Server service.
On the other hand, Start-CsWindowsService includes a ComputerName parameter that makes it easy to start a service on a remote computer: you simply include the ComputerName parameter followed by the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the remote computer.
Stop-Service does not have a comparable parameter.
In addition, the cmdlet's Report parameter enables you to keep a log of any errors that might occur when calling Start-CsWindowsService.

Like other Windows services, some Lync Server services have a dependency on another service; for example, the Lync Server Conferencing Attendant service cannot run unless the Application service is already running.
If you try to start a service that depends on another service, Start-CsWindowsService will start both of those services.
That means that, if you try to start the Conferencing Attendant service, the cmdlet will first start the Application service and then start the Conferencing Attendant service.
However, Start-CsWindowsService will not automatically start any dependent services of a service: if you start the Application service, the command will not automatically start the Conferencing Attendant service as well.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Start-CsWindows cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
In addition, you must also have local administrator rights on the destination computer in order to run this cmdlet.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Start-CsWindowsService"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Start-CsWindowsService
```

The command shown in Example 1 starts all the Lync Server services on the local computer.
This is done by calling Start-CsWindowsService without any parameters.
Note that you will not receive an error if you try to start a service that has already been started.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 starts all the Lync Server services on the local computer.
This is done by calling Start-CsWindowsService without any parameters.
Note that you will not receive an error if you try to start a service that has already been started.

Start-CsWindowsService

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 starts all the Skype for Business Server 2015 services on the local computer.
This is done by calling the Start-CsWindowsService cmdlet without any parameters.
Note that you will not receive an error if you try to start a service that has already been started.

Start-CsWindowsService

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Start-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS"
```

The preceding command starts the Response Group application service on the local computer.
To do this, the command uses the Name parameter followed by the service name: RTCRGS.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 starts the Response Group application service on the local computer.
To do this, the command uses the Name parameter followed by the service name: RTCRGS.

Start-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 starts the Response Group application service on the local computer.
To do this, the command uses the Name parameter followed by the service name: RTCRGS.

Start-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS"

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Start-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS" -ComputerName atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
```

The command shown in Example 3 also starts the Response Group application service; in this case, however, the service is started on the remote computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To start a service on a remote computer, include the ComputerName parameter followed by the FQDN of the remote computer.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 3 also starts the Response Group application service; in this case, however, the service is started on the remote computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

Start-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS" -ComputerName atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 3 also starts the Response Group application service; in this case, however, the service is started on the remote computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To start a service on a remote computer, include the ComputerName parameter followed by the FQDN of the remote computer.

Start-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS" -ComputerName atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

### -------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.Status -ne "Running"} | Start-CsWindowsService
```

In Example 4, the command searches the local computer for all the Lync Server services that are not currently running, then starts each of these inactive services.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsWindowsService to return a collection of all the Lync Server services.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those services where the Status property is not equal to Running.
This filtered collection is then piped to Start-CsWindowsService, which starts each service in the collection.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 4, the command searches the local computer for all the Lync Server services that are not currently running, then starts each of these inactive services.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsWindowsService to return a collection of all the Lync Server services.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those services where the Status property is not equal to Running.
This filtered collection is then piped to Start-CsWindowsService, which starts each service in the collection.

Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.Status -ne "Running"} | Start-CsWindowsService

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 4, the command searches the local computer for all the Skype for Business Server 2015 services that are not currently running, then starts each of these inactive services.
