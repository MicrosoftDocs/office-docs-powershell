## SYNTAX

Get-CsUICulture [-Verbose] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Although Microsoft Lync Server 2010 is available in multiple languages, the software is not a true MUI (multilingual user interface) application.
Among other things, this means that the user interface for the Lync Server Management Shell does not change languages any time you change the operating system language.
For example, suppose you have installed the U.S.
English version of Lync Server 2010 and are also running the Windows operating system under U.S.
English.
If you change the operating system culture (that is, the language and regional settings) to Danish, the Lync Server Management Shell will not automatically follow suit; instead, the Lync Server Management Shell user interface (including error messages and help text) will remain in U.S.
English.
If you need to change the culture for the Lync Server Management Shell, you must run the Set-CsUICulture cmdlet.

The Get-CsUICulture cmdlet provides a way for you to determine the culture currently used in the Lync Server Management Shell.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Get-CsUICulture cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins, RTCUniversalServerAdmins, RTCUniversalReadOnlyAdmins.
