## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

This cmdlet modifies a named voice normalization rule.
These rules are a required part of phone authorization and call routing.
They define the requirements for converting (or translating) numbers from an internal Lync Server 2010 format to a standard (E.164) format.
An understanding of regular expressions is helpful in order to define number patterns that will be translated.

Rules that are modified by using this cmdlet are part of the dial plan and, in addition to being accessible through the Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule cmdlet, can also be accessed through the NormalizationRules property returned by a call to the Get-CsDialPlan cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity "site:Redmond/Prefix Redmond" -Description "Add a prefix to all numbers on site Redmond"
```

This example sets the description of the rule Prefix Redmond on site Redmond to "Add a prefix to all numbers on site Redmond".

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example sets the description of the rule Prefix Redmond on site Redmond to "Add a prefix to all numbers on site Redmond".

Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity "site:Redmond/Prefix Redmond" -Description "Add a prefix to all numbers on site Redmond"

### Example 1 (Skype for Business Online)
```
PS C:\> {{ Add example code here }}
```

{{ Add example description here }}

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example sets the description of the rule Prefix Redmond on site Redmond to "Add a prefix to all numbers on site Redmond".

Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity "site:Redmond/Prefix Redmond" -Description "Add a prefix to all numbers on site Redmond"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity global/SeattleFourDigit -Description "Translate an internal four-digit extension" -Translation '+1206556$1'
```

This example modifies the voice normalization rule with the Identity global/SeattleFourDigit.
A new Description has been specified to reflect the modifications to the rule.
In addition, a Translation value has been specified that modifies the rule to translate any number matching the existing pattern of this rule to the same number but with the prefix +1206556.
For example, if the existing pattern matched any four-digit number and the number 1234 were entered, this rule would translate that extension to the number +12065561234.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example modifies the voice normalization rule with the Identity global/SeattleFourDigit.
A new Description has been specified to reflect the modifications to the rule.
In addition, a Translation value has been specified that modifies the rule to translate any number matching the existing pattern of this rule to the same number but with the prefix +1206556.
For example, if the existing pattern matched any four-digit number and the number 1234 were entered, this rule would translate that extension to the number +12065561234.

Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity global/SeattleFourDigit -Description "Translate an internal four-digit extension" -Translation '+1206556$1'

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example modifies the voice normalization rule with the Identity global/SeattleFourDigit.
A new Description has been specified to reflect the modifications to the rule.
In addition, a Translation value has been specified that modifies the rule to translate any number matching the existing pattern of this rule to the same number but with the prefix +1206556.
For example, if the existing pattern matched any four-digit number and the number 1234 were entered, this rule would translate that extension to the number +12065561234.

Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity global/SeattleFourDigit -Description "Translate an internal four-digit extension" -Translation '+1206556$1'

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
$a = Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity global/RedmondFourDigit
$a.name = "RedmondRule"
Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Instance $a
```

Example 3 changes the name of the normalization rule.
Keep in mind that changing the name also changes the name portion of the Identity.
The Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule cmdlet doesn't have a Name parameter, so in order to change the name we first call Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule to retrieve the rule with the Identity global/RedmondFourDigit and assign the returned object to the variable $a.
We then assign the string RedmondRule to the Name property of the object.
Next, we pass the variable to the Instance parameter of Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule to make the change permanent.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 changes the name of the normalization rule.
Keep in mind that changing the name also changes the name portion of the Identity.
The Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule cmdlet doesn't have a Name parameter, so in order to change the name we first call Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule to retrieve the rule with the Identity global/RedmondFourDigit and assign the returned object to the variable $a.
We then assign the string RedmondRule to the Name property of the object.
Next, we pass the variable to the Instance parameter of Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule to make the change permanent.

$a = Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity global/RedmondFourDigit

$a.name = "RedmondRule"

Set-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Instance $a

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 3 changes the name of the normalization rule.
Keep in mind that changing the name also changes the name portion of the Identity.
