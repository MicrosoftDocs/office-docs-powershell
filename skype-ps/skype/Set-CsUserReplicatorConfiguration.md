## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Although Lync Server 2010 maintains its own database of user accounts and user account data, Lync Server 2010 still strongly on AD DS as the ultimate source for user information.
For example, when a new Active Directory user account is created, you must supply basic information about the user account (such the Active Directory display name).
When a user is enabled for Lync Server, however, you do not need to specify a new display name.
That's because Lync Server uses the display name already stored in AD DS.

User account information, including the Active Directory display name, is subject to change over time.
For example, a user who gets married might change her last name and, in turn, need to change her display name as well.
In order to ensure that the Lync Server database and AD DS remain in synch, Lync Server must periodically check in with AD DS, retrieve the latest user account updates, and then modify the Lync Server user database accordingly.
This synchronization between AD DS and Lync Server is carried out by the User Replicator.

When you install Lync Server, a global set of User Replicator configuration settings is created for you.
By default, these settings are used to manage the User Replicator on an organization-wide basis.
Management of the User Replicator consists of identifying the domains that Lync Server needs to synch with in addition to indicating how often the User Replicator checks AD DS for user account updates.
By default, the User Replicator discovers and synchs with all available domains.
However, by using the AdDomainNamingContextList property you can restrict synchronization to a specific set of domains: the domains that appear in the AdDomainNamingContextList  property.

You can also create additional collections at the service scope, but only if you are working with Microsoft Lync Online 2010.

The Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration cmdlet enables you to modify any of the User Replicator settings currently in use in your organization.
You can use this cmdlet to add or remove domains from the list of domains the User Replicator must synchronize with, and to modify the time interval between replication cycles.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the RBAC roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom role-based access control (RBAC) roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity global -ReplicationCycleInterval "00:05:00"
```

The preceding command sets the value of the ReplicationCycleInterval of the global User Replicator settings to five minutes (00 hours: 05 minutes: 00 seconds).

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 1 sets the value of the ReplicationCycleInterval of the global User Replicator settings to five minutes (00 hours: 05 minutes: 00 seconds).

Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity global -ReplicationCycleInterval "00:05:00"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity global -ADDomainNamingContextList $Null
```

The command shown in Example 2 clears the value of the ADDomainNamingContextList property.
This task is carried out by including the ADDomainNamingContextList parameter and setting the parameter value to null.
By setting this value to null the User Replicator will automatically discover and synchronize with all the available domains.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 clears the value of the ADDomainNamingContextList property.
This task is carried out by including the ADDomainNamingContextList parameter and setting the parameter value to null.
By setting this value to null the User Replicator will automatically discover and synchronize with all the available domains.

Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity global -ADDomainNamingContextList $Null

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 clears the value of the ADDomainNamingContextList property.
This task is carried out by including the ADDomainNamingContextList parameter and setting the parameter value to null.

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity global -ADDomainNamingContextList @{Add="dc=fabrikam,dc=com"}
```

In Example 3 an additional name is added to the ADDomainNamingContextList property of the global User Replicator settings.
To do this, the syntax @{Add=} is used, along with the distinguished name of the domain being added.
When this command is executed, fabrikam.com will be added to the list of domain names.
To configure the global settings so that only fabrikam.com is on the list use this syntax:

-ADDomainNamingContextList @{Replace="dc=fabrikam,dc=com"}

When the AdDomainNamingContextList property is set to anything but a null value, the User Replicator will only synchronize with the domains listed in the property value.
This will be the case even if there are other domains in the deployment.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 3 an additional name is added to the ADDomainNamingContextList property of the global User Replicator settings.
