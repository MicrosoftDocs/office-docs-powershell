Use this cmdlet to assign the settings that enable and disable these features for a specific user.

You can check whether a user has been granted a per-user voice policy by calling a command in this format: Get-CsUser "\<user name\>" | Select-Object VoicePolicy.
For example:

Get-CsUser "Ken Myer" | Select-Object VoicePolicy
