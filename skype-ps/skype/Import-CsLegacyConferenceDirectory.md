## SYNTAX

```
Import-CsLegacyConferenceDirectory [-Report <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Import-CsLegacyConferenceDirectory is used in conjunction with the Merge-CsLegacyTopology cmdlet to enable organizations to migrate from Office Communications Server 2007 R2 to Lync Server 2010.
Import-CsLegacyConfiguration imports conferencing directories from  Communications Server 2007 R2 to Lync Server.

Before you can run Import-CsLegacyConferenceDirectory, you must first install the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Backward Compatibility interfaces package; this application is installed by running OCSWMIBC.msi.
(OCSWMIBC.msi can be found on the Lync Server 2010 installation DVD in the Setup folder.) After installing the Compatibility interfaces package, you should next run Merge-CsLegacyTopology.

When Merge-CsLegacyTopology finishes running, you can call Import-CsLegacyConferenceDirectory.
The Import-CsLegacyConferenceDirectory cmdlet first uses WMI to read legacy data from Communications Server 2007 R2, then takes the retrieved data and creates corresponding objects in Lync Server: for each conferencing directory found in your installation of Communications Server 2007 R2, a corresponding directory will be created in your new installation of Lync Server.

Import-CsLegacyConferenceDirectory should be rerun anytime conferences directories are added, deleted, or moved in the Communications Server 2007 R2 environment.
Import-CsLegacyConferenceDirectory should also be run anytime Merge-CsLegacyTopology is run; this helps to ensure the conference directories and the topology remain in sync.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Import-CsLegacyConferenceDirectory cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "Import-CsLegacyConferenceDirectory"}
