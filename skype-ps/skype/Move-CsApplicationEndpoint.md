# Move-CsApplicationEndpoint

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Moves an endpoint to a different Registrar pool.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Moves an endpoint to a different Registrar pool.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Move-CsApplicationEndpoint [-Identity] <UserIdParameter> [-TargetApplicationPool] <Fqdn>
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-Force] [-PassThru] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-IgnoreBackendStoreException]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

This cmdlet moves an existing endpoint contact object in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) from a Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 application pool to a Microsoft Lync Server 2010 application pool, or from one Lync Server 2010 application pool to another.
The application associated with the given endpoint must exist on the target pool.
To determine which application is associated with the endpoint, run the Get-CsTrustedApplicationEndpoint or Get-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber cmdlet.

This cmdlet is also used to upgrade the Active Directory contact object properties when an application deployed against Office Communications Server 2007 R2 is retargeted against Lync Server 2010.
Note that the source and target application pool will be the same in that case.
Also, if an application originally designed to work against Office Communications Server 2007 R2 is directly deployed against Lync Server 2010, then this cmdlet must be used with the Force flag to upgrade the Active Directory contact object properties.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Move-CsApplicationEndpoint cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Move-CsApplicationEndpoint"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Move-CsApplicationEndpoint -Identity sip:endpoint1@litwareinc.com -TargetApplicationPool TrustPoolA.litwareinc.com
```

This example moves the application endpoint contact object with the SIP address endpoint1@litwareinc.com to the trusted Registrar pool TrustPoolA.litwareinc.com.
Use this command to upgrade a UCMA 2.0 application to a Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA) 3.0 application after coexistence.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example moves the application endpoint contact object with the SIP address endpoint1@litwareinc.com to the trusted Registrar pool TrustPoolA.litwareinc.com.
Use this command to upgrade a UCMA 2.0 application to a Lync Server application after coexistence.

Move-CsApplicationEndpoint -Identity sip:endpoint1@litwareinc.com -TargetApplicationPool TrustPoolA.litwareinc.com

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example moves the application endpoint contact object with the SIP address endpoint1@litwareinc.com to the trusted Registrar pool TrustPoolA.litwareinc.com.
Use this command to upgrade a UCMA 2.0 application to a Skype for Business Server 2015 application after coexistence.

Move-CsApplicationEndpoint -Identity sip:endpoint1@litwareinc.com -TargetApplicationPool TrustPoolA.litwareinc.com

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Move-CsApplicationEndpoint -Identity sip:endpoint2@litwareinc.com -TargetApplicationPool TrustPoolA.litwareinc.com -Force
```

This example moves the application endpoint contact object with the SIP address endpoint2@litwareinc.com to the trusted Registrar pool TrustPoolA.litwareinc.com.
This example differs from Example 1 in that this command includes the Force parameter.
Use this command for an in-place migration of a UCMA 2.0 application or for direct deployment of a UCMA 2.0 application against a pure Lync Server 2010 deployment.
This will update an existing object in Active Directory with the necessary attributes so that routing can occur through the Lync Server 2010 Registrar.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example moves the application endpoint contact object with the SIP address endpoint2@litwareinc.com to the trusted Registrar pool TrustPoolA.litwareinc.com.
This example differs from Example 1 in that this command includes the Force parameter.
Use this command for an in-place migration of a UCMA 2.0 application or for direct deployment of a UCMA 2.0 application against a pure Lync Server deployment.

Move-CsApplicationEndpoint -Identity sip:endpoint2@litwareinc.com -TargetApplicationPool TrustPoolA.litwareinc.com -Force

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
