**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Removes an existing trunk configuration that describes the settings for a trunking peer entity such as a public switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway, IP-public branch exchange (PBX), or Session Border Controller (SBC) at the service provider.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsTrunkConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Use this cmdlet to remove a trunking configuration applicable to PSTN gateway entities.
Each configuration contains specific settings for a trunking peer entity such as a PSTN gateway, IP-PBX, or SBC at the service provider.
These settings configure such things as whether media bypass is enabled on this trunk, whether real-time transport control protocol (RTCP) packets are sent under certain conditions, and whether to require secure real-time protocol (SRTP) encryption.

Note that if you call Remove-CsTrunkConfiguration on the Global configuration, that trunk configuration will not be removed.
Instead the configuration will be "reset" and all custom settings will be replaced with default values.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsTrunkConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the  Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsTrunkConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Remove-CsTrunkConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond
```

This example removes the trunk configuration with the Identity site:Redmond.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example removes the trunk configuration with the Identity site:Redmond.

Remove-CsTrunkConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example removes the trunk configuration with the Identity site:Redmond.

Remove-CsTrunkConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsTrunkConfiguration -Filter site:* | Remove-CsTrunkConfiguration
```

Example 2 removes all trunk configurations defined at the site level.
The first part of the command is a call to the Get-CsTrunkConfiguration cmdlet that uses the Filter parameter to retrieve all trunk configurations with an Identity beginning with site: (that is, all trunk configurations defined at the site level).
This collection of configurations is then piped to the Remove-CsTrunkConfiguration cmdlet, which removes each object in the collection.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 removes all trunk configurations defined at the site level.
The first part of the command is a call to the Get-CsTrunkConfiguration cmdlet that uses the Filter parameter to retrieve all trunk configurations with an Identity beginning with site: (that is, all trunk configurations defined at the site level).
This collection of configurations is then piped to the Remove-CsTrunkConfiguration cmdlet, which removes each object in the collection.

Get-CsTrunkConfiguration -Filter site:* | Remove-CsTrunkConfiguration

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 removes all trunk configurations defined at the site level.
The first part of the command is a call to the Get-CsTrunkConfiguration cmdlet that uses the Filter parameter to retrieve all trunk configurations with an Identity beginning with site: (that is, all trunk configurations defined at the site level).
