This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber [-Identity] <UserIdParameter> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

Dial-in conferencing enables users to use any kind of telephone (such as a standard "land line," a mobile phone, or a Voice over Internet Protocol phone) to join the audio portion of a conference.
This enables users to participate in the meeting even if they do not have a computer or an Internet connection.
Users have full audio capabilities: they can speak to other participants and hear everything that takes place.
They just aren't able to see shared slides, video feeds, or other visual elements.

In order to provide users with dial-in conferencing capabilities, you must create dial-in conferencing access numbers: phone numbers users can call in order to be connected to a meeting.
Dial-in conferencing access numbers are created by using the New-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber cmdlet.
When you create a new dial-in conferencing access number, you actually create a new contact object in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS); this contact object is used to represent the access number and all its properties.
The Remove-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber cmdlet enables you to delete any of the dial-in conferencing numbers created by using New-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber.
When you run Remove-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber, the cmdlet not only deletes the number from the collection of dial-in conferencing access numbers but also deletes the Active Directory contact object that represents the given access number.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber"}

```
Get-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber -Filter {LineUri -like "tel:+1800*"} | Remove-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber
```

The preceding command deletes all the toll free dial-in conferencing access numbers; in this example, that means any numbers that have a LineUri that begins with "tel:+1800".
To do this, the command uses Get-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber and the Filter parameter to return a collection of all the toll free access numbers configured for use in the organization; the filter value {LineUri -like "tel:+1800*"} limits the returned data to those numbers where the LineUri property begins with the string value "tel:+1800".
This filtered collection is then piped to Remove-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber, which deletes each number in the collection.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 deletes all the toll free dial-in conferencing access numbers; in this example, that means any numbers that have a LineUri that begins with "tel:+1800".
