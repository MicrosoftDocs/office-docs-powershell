# Remove-CsMediaConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Removes the specified collection of media configuration settings

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Removes the specified collection of media configuration settings.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsMediaConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

This cmdlet removes a collection of media settings.
These settings relate to audio and video calls between client endpoints.

This cmdlet can also be used to remove the global media settings.
In that case, however, the settings will not actually be removed; instead, they will simply be reset to their default values.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsMediaConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsMediaConfiguration"}

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

This cmdlet removes a collection of media settings.
These settings relate to audio and video calls between client endpoints.

This cmdlet can also be used to remove the global media settings.
In that case, however, the settings will not actually be removed; instead, they will simply be reset to their default values.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Remove-CsMediaConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1
```

In Example 1, Remove-CsMediaConfiguration is used to delete the media configuration collection with the Identity site:Redmond1.
When media settings are removed from the site scope, that site will automatically begin to use the global media settings.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 1, Remove-CsMediaConfiguration is used to delete the media configuration collection with the Identity site:Redmond1.
When media settings are removed from the site scope, that site will automatically begin to use the global media settings.

Remove-CsMediaConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 1, the Remove-CsMediaConfiguration cmdlet is used to delete the media configuration collection with the Identity site:Redmond1.
When media settings are removed from the site scope, that site will automatically begin to use the global media settings.

Remove-CsMediaConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsMediaConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.EncryptionLevel -eq "RequireEncryption"} | Remove-CsMediaConfiguration
```

In the preceding example, three cmdlets--Get-CsMediaConfiguration, Where-Object, and Remove-CsMediaConfiguration--are used to remove all the media configuration collections where encryption is required of all parties involved in the conversation.
To do this, Get-CsMediaConfiguration is first used to return all the media configuration collections in the organization.
That information is then piped to Where-Object, which applies a filter that restricts the pipeline data to those collections where the EncryptionLevel property is equal to (-eq) RequireEncryption.
Finally, that filtered set of data is passed to Remove-CsMediaConfiguration, which deletes each item in the set.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, three cmdlets--Get-CsMediaConfiguration, Where-Object, and Remove-CsMediaConfiguration--are used to remove all the media configuration collections where encryption is required of all parties involved in the conversation.
To do this, Get-CsMediaConfiguration is first used to return all the media configuration collections in the organization.
That information is then piped to Where-Object, which applies a filter that restricts the pipeline data to those collections where the EncryptionLevel property is equal to (-eq) RequireEncryption.
Finally, that filtered set of data is passed to Remove-CsMediaConfiguration, which deletes each item in the set.

Get-CsMediaConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.EncryptionLevel -eq "RequireEncryption"} | Remove-CsMediaConfiguration

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, three cmdlets--the Get-CsMediaConfiguration cmdlet, the Where-Object cmdlet, and the Remove-CsMediaConfiguration cmdlet--are used to remove all the media configuration collections where encryption is required of all parties involved in the conversation.
To do this, the Get-CsMediaConfiguration cmdlet is first used to return all the media configuration collections in the organization.
That information is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which applies a filter that restricts the pipeline data to those collections where the EncryptionLevel property is equal to (-eq) RequireEncryption.
Finally, that filtered set of data is passed to the Remove-CsMediaConfiguration cmdlet, which deletes each item in the set.

Get-CsMediaConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.EncryptionLevel -eq "RequireEncryption"} | Remove-CsMediaConfiguration

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsMediaConfiguration -Filter service:* | Remove-CsMediaConfiguration
```

In this example all media configurations defined at the service scope (meaning the configuration applies to a specific service) are removed.
This is accomplished by first calling Get-CsMediaConfiguration using the Filter service:*.
This filter retrieves all media configuration collections with an Identity starting with service, which means all collections at the service scope.
That set of collections is then piped the Remove-CsMediaConfiguration, which removes them all.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In this example all media configurations defined at the service scope (meaning the configuration applies to a specific service) are removed.
This is accomplished by first calling Get-CsMediaConfiguration using the Filter service:*.
This filter retrieves all media configuration collections with an Identity starting with service, which means all collections at the service scope.
That set of collections is then piped the Remove-CsMediaConfiguration, which removes them all.

Get-CsMediaConfiguration -Filter service:* | Remove-CsMediaConfiguration

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In this example all media configurations defined at the service scope (meaning the configuration applies to a specific service) are removed.
This is accomplished by first calling the Get-CsMediaConfiguration cmdlet using the Filter service:*.
This filter retrieves all media configuration collections with an Identity starting with service, which means all collections at the service scope.
That set of collections is then piped the Remove-CsMediaConfiguration cmdlet, which removes them all.

Get-CsMediaConfiguration -Filter service:* | Remove-CsMediaConfiguration
