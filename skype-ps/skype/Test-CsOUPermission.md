**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Test-CsOUPermission -ObjectType <ObjectType> -OU <String> [-Domain <Fqdn>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-GlobalCatalog <Fqdn>] [-Report <String>] [-Verbose] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

If you have locked down your Active Directory domain (that is, if you have disabled permission inheritance), then the domain preparation that takes place when you install Microsoft Lync Server 2010 will not be able to add the permissions needed to manage users, computers, contacts, application contacts, and InetOrg persons.
(Domain administrators will still be able to manage these objects, but no one else, including members of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group, will have management permissions.) In that case, you will need to use the Grant-CsOUPermission cmdlet to grant the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group the appropriate permissions.
In addition, you will need to do this on a container-by-container basis.

The Test-CsOUPermission cmdlet enables you to determine whether or not the required permissions have been added to a specified Active Directory container.
Test-CsOUPermission returns True if the correct permissions have been applied, and returns False if the correct permissions have not been applied.
If the cmdlet returns False, you will then need to run Grant-CsOUPermission in order to make the necessary changes.

Who can run this cmdlet: To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Test-CsOUPermission"}
