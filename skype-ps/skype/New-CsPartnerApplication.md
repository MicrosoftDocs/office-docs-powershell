## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

In Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Preview, server-to-server authentication (for example, the authentication that enables Lync Server 2013 Preview and Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Preview to share information) is carried out using the OAuth security protocol.
This type of authentication typically requires three servers: the two servers that need to communicate with one another (Server A and B) and a third-party security token server.
If Servers A and B need to communicate with one another, the two servers contact the token server (also known as an OAuth server) and obtain mutually-trusted security tokens that the two servers can exchange in order to prove their identities.

If you are using an on-premises version of Lync Server 2013 Preview and you need to communicate with another server product that fully supports the OAuth protocol (for example, Exchange 2013 Preview or Microsoft SharePoint 2013) then you typically do not need to use a token server; that's because these server products are able to issue their own security tokens.
However, you will need to configure the other server product (e.g., Exchange 2013 Preview) as a partner application.
(You will also need to configure Lync Server 2013 Preview as a partner application for the other server product.) In Lync Server 2013 Preview, partner applications are managed by using the CsPartnerApplication cmdlets.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsPartnerApplication"}

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

In Skype for Business Server 2015, server-to-server authentication (for example, the authentication that enables Skype for Business Server 2015 and Exchange to share information) is carried out by using the OAuth security protocol.
This type of authentication typically requires three servers: the two servers that need to communicate with one another (Server A and B) and a third-party security token server.
If Servers A and B need to communicate with one another, the two servers contact the token server (also known as an OAuth server) and obtain mutually-trusted security tokens that the two servers can exchange in order to prove their identities.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new partner application with the Identity "MicrosoftExchange".
In this example, the new partner application uses the metadata URL https://autodiscover.litwareinc.com/metadata/json1.

New-CsPartnerApplication -Identity "MicrosoftExchange" -ApplicationIdentifier "microsoft.exchange" -ApplicationTrustLevel "Full" -MetadataUrl"https://autodiscover.litwareinc.com/metadata/json/1"

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new partner application with the Identity "MicrosoftExchange".
In this example, the new partner application uses the metadata URL https://autodiscover.litwareinc.com/metadata/json/1.

New-CsPartnerApplication -Identity "MicrosoftExchange" -ApplicationTrustLevel "Full" -MetadataUrl"https://autodiscover.litwareinc.com/metadata/json/1"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 also creates a new partner application with the Identity "MicrosoftExchange".
In this case, however, the new partner application does not use a metadata URL but, instead, is configured to use a predefined OAuth Server.
To do this, the command uses the UseOAuthServer parameter instead of the MetadataUrl parameter.

New-CsPartnerApplication -Identity "MicrosoftExchange" -ApplicationIdentifier "microsoft.exchange" -ApplicationTrustLevel "Full" -UseOAuthServer

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 also creates a new partner application with the Identity "MicrosoftExchange".
In this case, however, the new partner application does not use a metadata URL but, instead, is configured to use a predefined OAuth Server.
To do this, the command uses the UseOAuthServer parameter instead of the MetadataUrl parameter.

New-CsPartnerApplication -Identity "MicrosoftExchange" -ApplicationIdentifier "microsoft.exchange" -ApplicationTrustLevel "Full" -UseOAuthServer
