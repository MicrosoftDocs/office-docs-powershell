## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Lync Server 2010 enables users to connect to the system or to join public switched telephone network (PSTN) conferences via telephone.
Typically, logging on to the system or joining a conference requires the user to enter a user name or password; unfortunately, entering a user name and password can be a problem if you are using a phone that does not have an alphanumeric keypad.
Because of that, Lync Server enables you to supply users with numeric-only PINs; when prompted, users can then log on to the system or join a conference by entering the PIN instead of a user name and password.

Lync Server uses PIN policies to manage PIN authentication properties; for example, you can specify the minimum length for a PIN as well as determine whether you will allow PINs that use "common patterns" such as repeating digits (for example, a PIN like 11223344).
PIN policies can be configured at the global or the site scope; in addition, PIN policies can be configured at the per-user scope and then assigned to a user or a specified set of users.
In order to assign a per-user policy you must use the Grant-CsPinPolicy cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Grant-CsPinPolicy cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "Grant-CsPinPolicy"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Grant-CsPinPolicy -Identity "kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -PolicyName RedmondUsersPinPolicy
```

The command shown in Example 1 assigns the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy to the user kenmyer@litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 assigns the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy to the user kenmyer@litwareinc.com.

Grant-CsPinPolicy -Identity "kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -PolicyName RedmondUsersPinPolicy

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 assigns the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy to the user kenmyer@litwareinc.com.

Grant-CsPinPolicy -Identity "kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -PolicyName RedmondUsersPinPolicy

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Grant-CsPinPolicy -Identity kenmyer@litwareinc.com -PolicyName $Null
```

Example 2 unassigns any per-user PIN policy previously assigned to the user kenmyer@litwareinc.com.
Calling Grant-CsPinPolicy and setting the policy name to a null value ($Null) removes any per-user policy assigned to the user.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 unassigns any per-user PIN policy previously assigned to the user kenmyer@litwareinc.com.
Calling Grant-CsPinPolicy and setting the policy name to a null value ($Null) removes any per-user policy assigned to the user.

Grant-CsPinPolicy -Identity kenmyer@litwareinc.com -PolicyName $Null

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 unassigns any per-user PIN policy previously assigned to the user kenmyer@litwareinc.com.
Calling the Grant-CsPinPolicy cmdlet and setting the policy name to a null value ($Null) removes any per-user policy assigned to the user.

Grant-CsPinPolicy -Identity kenmyer@litwareinc.com -PolicyName $Null

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsUser -LDAPFilter "l=Redmond" | Grant-CsPinPolicy -PolicyName RedmondUsersPinPolicy
```

In Example 3, the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy is assigned to all the users who work in the city of Redmond.
To do this, the Get-CsUser cmdlet first retrieves a collection of all the users who work in Redmond; this is done by including the LDAPFilter parameter and using the filter value "l=Redmond".
(With LDAP filters, l, a lowercase L, represents the user's locality.) That collection of users is then piped to Grant-CsPinPolicy, which assigns each user the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 3, the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy is assigned to all the users who work in the city of Redmond.
To do this, the Get-CsUser cmdlet first retrieves a collection of all the users who work in Redmond; this is done by including the LdapFilter parameter and using the filter value "l=Redmond".
(With LDAP filters, l, a lowercase L, represents the user's locality.) That collection of users is then piped to Grant-CsPinPolicy, which assigns each user the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy.

Get-CsUser -LdapFilter "l=Redmond" | Grant-CsPinPolicy -PolicyName RedmondUsersPinPolicy

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 3, the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy is assigned to all the users who work in the city of Redmond.
To do this, the Get-CsUser cmdlet first retrieves a collection of all the users who work in Redmond; this is done by including the LdapFilter parameter and using the filter value "l=Redmond".
(With LDAP filters, l, a lowercase L, represents the user's locality.) That collection of users is then piped to the Grant-CsPinPolicy cmdlet, which assigns each user the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy.

Get-CsUser -LdapFilter "l=Redmond" | Grant-CsPinPolicy -PolicyName RedmondUsersPinPolicy

### -------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsUser -Filter {PinPolicy -eq $Null} | Grant-CsPinPolicy -PolicyName RedmondUsersPinPolicy
```

In the preceding command, the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy is assigned to all the users who have not been assigned a per-user PIN policy.
To determine which users have not been assigned a PIN policy, the Get-CsUser cmdlet is called, along with the Filter parameter; the filter value {ClientPinPolicy -eq $Null} returns only those users where the ClientPinPolicy property is null (that is, no per-user PIN policy has been assigned).
That collection of users is then piped to Grant-CsPinPolicy, which assigns the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy to each person in the collection.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 4, the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy is assigned to all the users who have not been assigned a per-user PIN policy.
To determine which users have not been assigned a PIN policy, the Get-CsUser cmdlet is called, along with the Filter parameter; the filter value {ClientPinPolicy -eq $Null} returns only those users where the ClientPinPolicy property is null (that is, no per-user PIN policy has been assigned).
That collection of users is then piped to Grant-CsPinPolicy, which assigns the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy to each person in the collection.

Get-CsUser -Filter {PinPolicy -eq $Null} | Grant-CsPinPolicy -PolicyName RedmondUsersPinPolicy

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 4, the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy is assigned to all the users who have not been assigned a per-user PIN policy.
To determine which users have not been assigned a PIN policy, the Get-CsUser cmdlet is called, along with the Filter parameter; the filter value {ClientPinPolicy -eq $Null} returns only those users where the ClientPinPolicy property is null (that is, no per-user PIN policy has been assigned).
That collection of users is then piped to the Grant-CsPinPolicy cmdlet, which assigns the policy RedmondUsersPinPolicy to each person in the collection.

Get-CsUser -Filter {PinPolicy -eq $Null} | Grant-CsPinPolicy -PolicyName RedmondUsersPinPolicy

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Indicates the Identity of the user account to be assigned the per-user PIN policy.
User Identities can be specified using one of four formats: 1) the user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (four example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).
User Identities can also be specified by using the user's Active Directory distinguished name.

In addition, you can use the asterisk (*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
For example, the Identity "* Smith" returns all the users who have a display name that ends with the string value " Smith".

```yaml
Type: UserIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)

```

### -PolicyName
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

"Name" of the policy to be assigned.
The PolicyName is simply the policy Identity minus the policy scope (the "tag:" prefix).
For example, a policy with the Identity tag:Redmond has a PolicyName equal to Redmond; a policy with the Identity tag:RedmondUsersPinPolicy has a PolicyName equal to  RedmondUsersPinPolicy.
To unassign a per-user policy previously assigned to a user, set the PolicyName to a null value ($Null).
