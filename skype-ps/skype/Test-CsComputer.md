## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Test-CsComputer is an example of a Lync Server 2010 "synthetic transaction." Synthetic transactions are used in Lync Server 2010 to verify that users are able to successfully complete common tasks such as logging on to the system, exchanging instant messages, or making calls to a phone located on the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
These tests can be conducted manually by an administrator, or they can be run automatically by an application such as Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (formerly Microsoft Operations Manager).

Test-CsComputer, which can be run only on the local computer, verifies the status of all the Lync Server 2010 services on that computer.
The cmdlet also checks to see if the appropriate firewall ports have been opened on the computer, and determines whether or not the Active Directory groups created when you installed Lync Server 2010 have been added to the corresponding local groups.
For example, Test-CsComputer will verify that the Active Directory group RTCUniversalUserAdmins has been added to the local Administrators group.
