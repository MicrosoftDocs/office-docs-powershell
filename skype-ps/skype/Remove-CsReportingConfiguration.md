### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)

```

In Example 2, all the reporting configuration settings currently in use in the organization are removed.
To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsReportingConfiguration cmdlet to return a collection of all the reporting configuration settings.
This collection is then piped to Remove-CsReportingConfiguration, which removes each item in the collection.

Get-CsReportingConfiguration | Remove-CsReportingConfiguration

That filtered collection is then piped to Remove-CsReportingConfiguration, which removes each item in the collection.

Get-CsReportingConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.ReportingUrl -eq "https://atl-sql-002.litwareinc.com/lync_reports" | Remove-CsReportingConfiguration
