```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Reporting configuration settings are used to specify the home page for the Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Monitoring Reports; if you are not using Monitoring Reports then there is no reason for you to modify the reporting configuration settings.

If you do not know the URL for the Monitoring Reports home page you can determine that URL by doing the following:

Open the SQL Server Reporting Services Configuration Manager for the SQL Server instance that contains your monitoring database.

In the Configuration Manager, click Report Manager URL and then click the URL for your Monitoring Reports.
If you see two URLs, click the one that uses the https protocol.

In SQL Server Reporting Services, click LyncServerReports.

On the LyncServerReports page, click Reports Home Page.
That will take you to the home page for the Monitoring Reports.
You can then copy the URL and use that URL in conjunction with the CsReportingConfiguration cmdlets.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsReportingConfiguration"}
