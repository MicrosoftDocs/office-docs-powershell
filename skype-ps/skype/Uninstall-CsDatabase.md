## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Lync Server 2010 makes extensive use of SQL Server databases such as the Central Management store and the Archiving database.
These databases are set up at the same time you install Lync Server 2010 or at the same time you install a Lync Server 2010 role (such as Monitoring Server) that requires a database back end.
After the databases have been installed, you will rarely need to uninstall them.

However, it is possible that you might need to uninstall a Lync Server 2010 database at some point; for example, a hardware failure or an issue with network connectivity might make an existing database unusable.
Regardless of the reason, the Uninstall-CsDatabase cmdlet provides a way for you to remove or detach any of the SQL Server databases used by Lync Server 2010.

Who can run this cmdlet: You must be a member of the domain, a SQL Server administrator, and a local administrator on the computer where SQL Server is installed in order to run the Uninstall-CsDatabase cmdlet locally.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Uninstall-CsDatabase"}
