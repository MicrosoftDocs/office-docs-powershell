## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

Before implementing voice routes and voice policies, it's a good idea to test them out on various phone numbers to ensure the results are what you're expecting.
You can do this testing by creating test scenarios with this cmdlet.

The New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration cmdlet defines the voice route, usage, dial plan, and voice policy against which to test a specified phone number.
All of this information can be defined and retrieved using other cmdlets; see the parameter descriptions for this topic for more information.

The configurations created with this cmdlet are tested using the Test-CsVoiceTestConfiguration cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration -Identity TestConfig1
```

This example creates a new voice test configuration with default values that has the Identity TestConfig1.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example creates a new voice test configuration with default values that has the Identity TestConfig1.

New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration -Identity TestConfig1

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example creates a new voice test configuration with default values that has the Identity TestConfig1.

New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration -Identity TestConfig1

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration TestConfig1 -TargetDialplan site:Redmond1
```

This example creates a new voice test configuration named TestConfig1 and sets the TargetDialplan parameter to site:Redmond1.
This will result in the tests for expected number, usage, and route to be run against the settings for the dial plan for the site Redmond1.

In this example we declared TestConfig1 without specifying the Identity parameter.
Identity is a positional parameter, so the first value in the command following the cmdlet name is recognized by the cmdlet as the Identity.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example creates a new voice test configuration named TestConfig1 and sets the TargetDialplan parameter to site:Redmond1.
This will result in the tests for expected number, usage, and route to be run against the settings for the dial plan for the site Redmond1.

In this example we declared TestConfig1 without specifying the Identity parameter.
Identity is a positional parameter, so the first value in the command following the cmdlet name is recognized by the cmdlet as the Identity.

New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration TestConfig1 -TargetDialplan site:Redmond1

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example creates a new voice test configuration named TestConfig1 and sets the TargetDialplan parameter to site:Redmond1.
This will result in the tests for expected number, usage, and route to be run against the settings for the dial plan for the site Redmond1.

In this example we declared TestConfig1 without specifying the Identity parameter.
Identity is a positional parameter, so the first value in the command following the cmdlet name is recognized by the cmdlet as the Identity.

New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration TestConfig1 -TargetDialplan site:Redmond1

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration -Identity TestConfig1 -DialedNumber 5551212 -ExpectedTranslatedNumber +5551212
```

This example creates a new voice test configuration named TestConfig1.
This configuration will use the default values to test the DialedNumber 5551212 against an expected output (ExpectedTranslatedNumber) of +5551212.
This expectation is based on the normalization rules associated with the dial plan that will be used when a test is run against this object.
That test must be run using the Test-CsVoiceTestConfiguration cmdlet.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example creates a new voice test configuration named TestConfig1.
This configuration will use the default values to test the DialedNumber 5551212 against an expected output (ExpectedTranslatedNumber) of +5551212.
This expectation is based on the normalization rules associated with the dial plan that will be used when a test is run against this object.
That test must be run using the Test-CsVoiceTestConfiguration cmdlet.

New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration -Identity TestConfig1 -DialedNumber 5551212 -ExpectedTranslatedNumber +5551212

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example creates a new voice test configuration named TestConfig1.

New-CsVoiceTestConfiguration -Identity TestConfig1 -DialedNumber 5551212 -ExpectedTranslatedNumber +5551212

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
A string uniquely identifying this test scenario.

This string can be up to 32 characters in length and may contain any alphanumeric characters plus the backslash (\\), period (.) or underscore (_).

The value of this parameter does not include scope because this object can be created only at the global scope.
Therefore only a unique name is required.
