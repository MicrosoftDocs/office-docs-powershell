```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

The domain preparation that takes place when you install Lync Server 2010 does not automatically add the permissions that enable members of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group to run the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet.
That means that, by default, you must be a domain administrator in order to enable a topology.
To give members of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group the right to enable a topology, you must run the Grant-CsSetupPermissions cmdlet.
In addition, you will need to run this cmdlet against each Active Directory container that houses computers running Lync Server.

The Test-CsSetupPermission cmdlet enables you to determine whether or not the requisite permissions have been added to a given Active Directory container (that is, a container hosting computers running Lync Server).
Test-CsSetupPermission returns True if the correct permissions have been applied, and returns False if the correct permissions have not been applied.
If the cmdlet returns False, you will need to run Grant-CsSetupPermission in order to make the necessary changes to the Active Directory container.

Who can run this cmdlet: To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShellWindows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Test-CsSetupPermission"}
