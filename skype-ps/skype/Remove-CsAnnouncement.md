## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsAnnouncement [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

An organization can own phone numbers that are not assigned to users or phones, but that are still valid numbers that can be called.
By default when someone dials one of those numbers, that person will receive a busy signal and the call may result in an error returned to the SIP client.
By applying announcement settings to unassigned numbers, administrators have the option of playing a message, returning a busy signal, or redirecting the call.
This cmdlet removes one or more of these announcement settings.

If you attempt to remove an announcement that is associated with an unassigned number range, by default you'll receive a prompt asking if you really want to remove the announcement.
If you delete the announcement, the AnnouncementName property of that range will be displayed as Null and no announcement will be played when those numbers are reached, only a busy signal will be heard.
However, the AnnouncementId property value (the GUID of the Announcement that was removed) will remain visible.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsAnnouncement cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsAnnouncement"}
