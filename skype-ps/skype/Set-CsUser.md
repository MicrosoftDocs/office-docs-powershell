## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

Set-CsUser enables you to modify the Lync Server-related user account attributes that are stored in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
For example, you can disable or re-enable a user for Lync Server; enable or disable a user for audio/video (A/V) communications; or modify a user's private line and line URI numbers.
Set-CsUser can be used only for users who have been enabled for Lync Server.

The only attributes you can modify using Set-CsUser are attributes related to Lync Server.
Other user account attributes, such as the user's job title or department, cannot be modified by using this cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsUser cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsUser\b"}

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Online

The Set-CsUser cmdlet enables you to modify property values for one or more Skype for Business Online user accounts; for example, you can disable or re-enable a user for Skype for Business Online.
However, the only attributes you can modify using the Set-CsUser cmdlet are attributes related to Skype for Business Online.
Other user account attributes, such as the user's job title or department, cannot be modified by using this cmdlet.

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

The Set-CsUser cmdlet enables you to modify the Skype for Business Server 2015-related user account attributes that are stored in Active Directory Domain Services.
For example, you can disable or re-enable a user for Skype for Business Server 2015; enable or disable a user for audio/video (A/V) communications; or modify a user's private line and line URI numbers.
The Set-CsUser cmdlet can be used only for users who have been enabled for Skype for Business Server 2015.

The only attributes you can modify using the Set-CsUser cmdlet are attributes related to Skype for Business Server 2015.
Other user account attributes, such as the user's job title or department, cannot be modified by using this cmdlet.
Keep in mind, however, that the Skype for Business Server 2015 attributes should only be modified by using the Set-CsUser cmdlet or the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
You should not attempt to manually configure these attributes.

```

### -HostedVoiceMail
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

When set to True, enables a user's voice mail calls to be routed to a hosted version of Microsoft Exchange Server.
In addition, setting this option to True enables Lync 2010 users to directly place a call to another user's voice mail.



**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

When set to True, enables a user's voice mail calls to be routed to a hosted version of Microsoft Exchange Server.
In addition, setting this option to True enables Lync users to directly place a call to another user's voice mail.

Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LineURI
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Phone number assigned to the user.
The line Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) must be specified using the E.164 format and use the "TEL:" prefix.
For example: TEL:+14255551297.
Any extension number should be added to the end of the line URI, for example: TEL:+14255551297;ext=51297.



**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Phone number assigned to the user.
The line Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) must be specified using the E.164 format and use the "TEL:" prefix.
For example: TEL:+14255551297.
Any extension number should be added to the end of the line URI, for example: TEL:+14255551297;ext=51297.

It is important to note that Lync Server treats TEL:+14255551297 and TEL:+14255551297;ext=51297 as two different numbers.
If you assign Ken Myer the line URI TEL:+14255551297 and later try to assign Pilar Ackerman the line URI TEL:+14255551297;ext=51297, that assignment will succeed; the number assigned to Pilar will not be flagged as a duplicate number.
This is due to the fact that, depending on your setup, those two numbers could actually be different.
For example, in some organizations dialing 1-425-555-1297 routes your call to an Exchange Auto Attendant.
Conversely, dialing just the extension (51297) or using Lync to dial the number 1-425-555-1297 extension 51297 will route your call directly to the user.



**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Online

**Below Content Applies To:** Skype for Business Server 2015

Phone number assigned to the user.
The line Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) must be specified using the E.164 format and use the "TEL:" prefix.
For example: TEL:+14255551297.
Any extension number should be added to the end of the line URI, for example: TEL:+14255551297;ext=51297.

It is important to note that Skype for Business Server 2015 treats TEL:+14255551297 and TEL:+14255551297;ext=51297 as two different numbers.
If you assign Ken Myer the line URI TEL:+14255551297 and later try to assign Pilar Ackerman the line URI TEL:+14255551297;ext=51297, that assignment will succeed; the number assigned to Pilar will not be flagged as a duplicate number.
This is due to the fact that, depending on your setup, those two numbers could actually be different.
For example, in some organizations dialing 1-425-555-1297 routes your call to an Exchange Auto Attendant.
Conversely, dialing just the extension (51297) or using Skype for Business to dial the number 1-425-555-1297 extension 51297 will route your call directly to the user.

### -PrivateLine
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

Phone number for the user's private telephone line.
A private line is a phone number that is not published in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and, as a result, is not readily available to other people.
In addition, this private line bypasses most in-bound call routing rules; for example, a call to a private line will not be forwarded to a person's delegates.
Private lines are often used for personal phone calls or for business calls that should be kept separate from other team members.

The private line value should be specified using the E.164 format, and be prefixed by the "TEL:" prefix.
For example: TEL:+14255551297.

### -OnPremLineURI
Specifies the phone number assigned to the user if no number is assigned to that user in the Skype for Business hybrid environment.
The line Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) must be specified using the E.164 format and use the "TEL:" prefix.
For example: TEL:+14255551297.
Any extension number should be added to the end of the line URI, for example: TEL:+14255551297;ext=51297.

Note that Skype for Business treats TEL:+14255551297 and TEL:+14255551297;ext=51297 as two different numbers.
If you assign Ken Myer the line URI TEL:+14255551297 and later try to assign Pilar Ackerman the line URI TEL:+14255551297;ext=51297, that assignment will succeed.
Depending on your setup, those two numbers could actually be different.
For example, in some organizations dialing 1-425-555-1297 routes your call to an Exchange Auto Attendant.
Conversely, dialing just the extension (51297) or using Skype for Business to dial the number 1-425-555-1297 extension 51297 will route your call directly to the user.
