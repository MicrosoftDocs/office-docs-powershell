## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

Many organizations (including organizations involved in health care and organizations involved in the financial industry) are required to maintain archives of all their electronic communications; this includes conversations that might take place using the Persistent Chat service.
Lync Server allows you to create a separate compliance database that keeps a detailed of archive of everything that happens in your Persistent Chat chat rooms.
Persistent Chat compliance can be enabled or disabled at the site scope or at the service scope (that is, compliance can be enabled or disabled for a given Persistent Chat pool).
In addition, Persistent Chat compliance can only be managed using Windows PowerShell; there are no options available in the Lync Server 2013 Preview Control Panel for managing Persistent Chat compliance.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsPersistentChatComplianceConfiguration"}

Lync Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the New-CsPersistentChatComplianceConfiguration cmdlet are not available in the Lync Server Control Panel.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of Persistent Chat compliance configuration settings for the Redmond site.
In this example, both the AddUserDetails and the AddChatRoomDetails properties are set to True ($True).

New-CsPersistentChatComplianceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" -AddUserDetails $True -AddChatRoomDetails $True

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of Persistent Chat compliance configuration settings for the Redmond site.
In this example, both the AddUserDetails and the AddChatRoomDetails properties are set to True ($True).

New-CsPersistentChatComplianceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" -AddUserDetails $True -AddChatRoomDetails $True

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 also demonstrates how to create a new collection of Persistent Chat compliance configuration settings for the Redmond site.
In this example, the RunInterval property is set to 30 minutes; that is, 00 hours : 30 minutes : 00 seconds.

New-CsPersistentChatComplianceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" -RunInterval "00:30:00"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 also demonstrates how to create a new collection of Persistent Chat compliance configuration settings for the Redmond site.
In this example, the RunInterval property is set to 30 minutes; that is, 00 hours : 30 minutes : 00 seconds.

New-CsPersistentChatComplianceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" -RunInterval "00:30:00"

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the new Persistent Chat compliance settings being created.
New compliance settings can be created at either the site or the service scope (for the Persistent Chat Server service, only).
To create new settings at the site scope, use syntax similar to this:

-Identity "site:Redmond"

To create new settings at the service scope, use syntax like this:

-Identity "service:PersistentChatServer:atl-gc-001.litwareinc.com"
