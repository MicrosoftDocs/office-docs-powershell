# Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Removes one or more Kerberos account assignments.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Removes one or more Kerberos account assignments.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

In Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 and Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2, IIS ran under a standard user account.
This had the potential to cause issues: if that password expired you could lose your Web Services, an issue that was often difficult to diagnose.
To help avoid the issue of expiring passwords, Microsoft Lync Server 2010 enables you to create a computer account (for a computer that doesn't actually exist) that can serve as the authentication principal for all the computers in a site that are running IIS.
Because these accounts use the Kerberos authentication protocol, the accounts are referred to as Kerberos accounts, and the new authentication process is known as Kerberos web authentication.
This enables you to manage all your IIS servers by using a single account.

To run your servers under this new authentication principal, you must first create a computer account (which, again, is not tied to an actual computer) by using the New-CsKerberosAccount cmdlet; this account is then assigned to one or more sites.
After the assignment has been made, the association is enabled by running the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet; among other things, this creates the required service principal name (SPN) in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
SPNs provide a way for client applications to locate a particular service.

Each Lync Server 2010 site can be associated with, at most, a single Kerberos account.
(However, each account can be associated with multiple sites.) At any time you can use the Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet to remove the association between a site and an account.
This cmdlet does not delete the account in question; it simply severs the association between the account and the site, effectively disabling Kerberos web authentication in that site.

Note that, after running Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment, you must then run Enable-CsTopology.
This removes the account's service principal name from Active Directory, and complete disables Kerberos web authentication.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment -Identity "site:Redmond"
Enable-CsTopology
```

The preceding commands remove the Kerberos account assignment from the Redmond site, then call Enable-CsTopology to finish disabling Kerberos web authentication.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The commands shown in Example 1 remove the Kerberos account assignment from the Redmond site, then call Enable-CsTopology to finish disabling Kerberos web authentication.

Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment -Identity "site:Redmond"

Enable-CsTopology

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The commands shown in Example 1 remove the Kerberos account assignment from the Redmond site, then call the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet to finish disabling Kerberos web authentication.

Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment -Identity "site:Redmond"

Enable-CsTopology

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsKerberosAccountAssignment | Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment
Enable-CsTopology
```

In Example 2, all the Kerberos account assignments currently in use are deleted.
To do this, the first command calls Get-CsKerberosAccountAssignment (without any parameters) in order to return a collection of all the Kerberos account assignments.
This collection is then piped to Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment, which deletes each assignment in the collection.
When that's done, the second command in the example calls Enable-CsTopology to finish disabling Kerberos web authentication.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, all the Kerberos account assignments currently in use are deleted.
To do this, the first command calls Get-CsKerberosAccountAssignment (without any parameters) in order to return a collection of all the Kerberos account assignments.
This collection is then piped to Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment, which deletes each assignment in the collection.
When that's done, the second command in the example calls Enable-CsTopology to finish disabling Kerberos web authentication.

Get-CsKerberosAccountAssignment | Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment

Enable-CsTopology

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, all the Kerberos account assignments currently in use are deleted.
To do this, the first command calls the Get-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet (without any parameters) in order to return a collection of all the Kerberos account assignments.
This collection is then piped to the Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet, which deletes each assignment in the collection.
When that's done, the second command in the example calls the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet to finish disabling Kerberos web authentication.

Get-CsKerberosAccountAssignment | Remove-CsKerberosAccountAssignment

Enable-CsTopology
