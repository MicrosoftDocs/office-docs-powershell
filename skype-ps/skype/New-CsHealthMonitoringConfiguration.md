## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Synthetic transactions are used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010 to verify that users are able to successfully complete common tasks such as logging on to the system, exchanging instant messages, or making calls to a phone located on the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
These tests can be conducted "manually" by an administrator, or they can be automatically run by an application such as Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (formerly Microsoft Operations Manager).

Synthetic transactions can be conducted in two different ways.
Many administrators will use the CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration cmdlets to set up test accounts for each of their Registrar pools.
These test accounts are a pair of user accounts that have been preconfigured for use with synthetic transactions.
(Typically these are test accounts and not accounts that belong to actual users.) When these test accounts are configured for a pool, administrators can run a synthetic transaction against that pool without having to specify the identities of (and supply the credentials for) the user accounts involved in the test.
Instead, the synthetic transaction will automatically use the preconfigured test accounts when performing its checks.

Alternatively, administrators can run a synthetic transaction using actual user accounts.
For example, if two users are unable to exchange instant messages, an administrator can run a synthetic transaction using the two user accounts in question (as opposed to a pair of test accounts).
If you decide to conduct a synthetic transaction using actual user accounts you will have to supply the credentials for each user.

The New-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration cmdlet provides a way for you to create a new health monitoring configuration settings for a Registrar or Director pool.
When creating a new collection of health monitoring configuration settings, you must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the pool, as well as the SIP addresses of the two accounts that will serve as the pool test accounts.
(However, you do not need to provide the passwords for those test accounts.) Note that each pool can host, at most, a single collection of health monitoring configuration settings.
If you try to create a new collection for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com and this pool has already been assigned a Registrar, then your command will fail.

When you run New-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration you might receive a warning if you have pools that have not been assigned test users; this might include Director pools as well as Office Communications Server pools.
These warnings can be ignored.
If you prefer, you can assign test users homed on other pools to your Director pools; that would enable you to run the Test-CsRegistration cmdlet against the Director.
However, test users cannot be assigned to Office Communications Server pools.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -Identity atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -SecondTestUserSipUri "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com"
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of health monitoring configuration settings for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
These new settings will use sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com and sip:pilar@litwareinc.com as the preconfigured test accounts.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of health monitoring configuration settings for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
These new settings will use sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com and sip:pilar@litwareinc.com as the preconfigured test accounts.

New-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -Identity atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -SecondTestUserSipUri "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of health monitoring configuration settings for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
These new settings will use sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com and sip:pilar@litwareinc.com as the preconfigured test accounts.

New-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -Identity atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -SecondTestUserSipUri "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
$x = Get-CsService -Registrar | Select-Object PoolFqdn
foreach ($i in $x)
   {New-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -Identity $i.PoolFqdn -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -SecondTestUserSipUri "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com"}
```

Example 2 creates a new collection of health monitoring configuration settings for all the Registrar pools in the organization.
To do that, the first command in the example uses the Get-Service cmdlet and the Registrar parameter to return a collection of all the Registrar pools.
This collection is then piped to the Select-Object cmdlet, which picks out only the PoolFqdn property.
(This property returns the FQDN of a Registrar pool.) These FQDNs are stored in a variable named $x.

In the second command, a foreach loop is created to loop through each Registrar pool FQDN.
For each FQDN, New-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration is called to create a new collection of configuration settings, with the FQDN stored in $x used as the Identity for the new collection.
Each collection is also assigned the same two test accounts: sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com and sip:pilar@litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 creates a new collection of health monitoring configuration settings for all the Registrar pools in the organization.
To do that, the first command in the example uses the Get-Service cmdlet and the Registrar parameter to return a collection of all the Registrar pools.
This collection is then piped to the Select-Object cmdlet, which picks out only the PoolFqdn property.
(This property returns the FQDN of a Registrar pool.) These FQDNs are stored in a variable named $x.

In the second command, a foreach loop is created to loop through each Registrar pool FQDN.
For each FQDN, New-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration is called to create a new collection of configuration settings, with the FQDN stored in $x used as the Identity for the new collection.
Each collection is also assigned the same two test accounts: sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com and sip:pilar@litwareinc.com.

$x = Get-CsService -Registrar | Select-Object PoolFqdn

foreach ($i in $x)

{New-CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration -Identity $i.PoolFqdn -FirstTestUserSipUri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -SecondTestUserSipUri "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com"}
