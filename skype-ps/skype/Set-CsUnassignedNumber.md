## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Unassigned numbers are phone numbers that have been assigned to an organization but that have not been assigned to specific users or phones.
Microsoft Lync Server 2010 can be set up to route calls to appropriate destinations when an unassigned number is called.
This cmdlet modifies the settings that define that routing.

In order to modify some of the settings for this cmdlet, your system must already either have Announcements defined or an Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) Auto Attendant set up.
To determine whether you have Announcements, call the Get-CsAnnouncement cmdlet.
To create a new Announcement, call New-CsAnnouncement.
To check on Exchange UM Auto Attendant settings, run the Get-CsExUmContact cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsUnassignedNumber cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsUnassignedNumber"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsUnassignedNumber -Identity UNSet1 -NumberRangeStart "+14255551000" -NumberRangeEnd "+14255551900"
```

This example modifies the unassigned number range with the name UNSet1.
We first pass the Identity parameter the value UNSet1, the name of the unassigned number range we want to modify.
We then use the NumberRangeStart (+14255551000) and NumberRangeEnd (+14255551900) parameters to modify the range of unassigned numbers to which the specified announcement or Auto Attendant will apply.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example modifies the unassigned number range with the name UNSet1.
We first pass the Identity parameter the value UNSet1, the name of the unassigned number range we want to modify.
We then use the NumberRangeStart (+14255551000) and NumberRangeEnd (+14255551900) parameters to modify the range of unassigned numbers to which the specified announcement or Auto Attendant will apply.

Set-CsUnassignedNumber -Identity UNSet1 -NumberRangeStart "+14255551000" -NumberRangeEnd "+14255551900"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example modifies the unassigned number range with the name UNSet1.
We first pass the Identity parameter the value UNSet1, the name of the unassigned number range we want to modify.
We then use the NumberRangeStart (+14255551000) and NumberRangeEnd (+14255551900) parameters to modify the range of unassigned numbers to which the specified announcement or Auto Attendant will apply.

Set-CsUnassignedNumber -Identity UNSet1 -NumberRangeStart "+14255551000" -NumberRangeEnd "+14255551900"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsUnassignedNumber | Where-Object {$_.AnnouncementName -match "Welcome"} | Set-CsUnassignedNumber -AnnouncementService ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com -AnnouncementName "Help Desk Announcement"
```

This example modifies the Announcement of all unassigned number range settings that currently have an Announcement with the string "Welcome" in the name.
First we call Get-CsUnassignedNumber to retrieve all unassigned number settings.
We pipe that collection of settings to Where-Object, which narrows down the collection to only those settings where the AnnouncementName property contains (-match) the string Welcome.
Once we have those settings, we pipe them to Set-CsUnassignedNumber, where we modify the Application Server ID of the Announcement Service (ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com) with the AnnouncementService parameter and the name of the new announcement (Help Desk Announcement) with the AnnouncementName parameter.
Note that even if the new Announcement has a different name but the same service ID, you must still specify the service ID along with the name.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This example modifies the Announcement of all unassigned number range settings that currently have an Announcement with the string "Welcome" in the name.
First we call Get-CsUnassignedNumber to retrieve all unassigned number settings.
We pipe that collection of settings to Where-Object, which narrows down the collection to only those settings where the AnnouncementName property contains (-match) the string Welcome.

Note that even if the new Announcement has a different name but the same service ID, you must still specify the service ID along with the name.

Get-CsUnassignedNumber | Where-Object {$_.AnnouncementName -match "Welcome"} | Set-CsUnassignedNumber -AnnouncementService ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com -AnnouncementName "Help Desk Announcement"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This example modifies the Announcement of all unassigned number range settings that currently have an Announcement with the string "Welcome" in the name.
First we call the Get-CsUnassignedNumber cmdlet to retrieve all unassigned number settings.
We pipe that collection of settings to the Where-Object cmdlet, which narrows down the collection to only those settings where the AnnouncementName property contains (-match) the string Welcome.
Once we have those settings, we pipe them to the Set-CsUnassignedNumber cmdlet, where we modify the Application Server ID of the Announcement Service (ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com) with the AnnouncementService parameter and the name of the new announcement (Help Desk Announcement) with the AnnouncementName parameter.
