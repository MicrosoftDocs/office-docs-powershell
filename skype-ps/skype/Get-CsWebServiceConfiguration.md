## SYNTAX

### Identity

```

### Filter

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Many Microsoft Lync Server 2010 components are web-based: these components either use web services or web pages to carry out their tasks.
For example, users employ a web service when searching for new contacts in the Address Book or when using group expansion to view the individual members of a distribution group.
Likewise, components ranging from dial-in conferencing to Microsoft Lync Server 2010 Control Panel use web pages as the interface between Lync Server 2010 and users.

The CsWebServiceConfiguration cmdlets enable administrators to manage Web Services configuration settings throughout the organization; this includes managing group expansion, certificate settings, and allowed authentication methods.
Because you can configure different settings at the global, site, and service scope (albeit for the only the Web Services service), you can customize Web Services capabilities for different users and different locations.

The Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration cmdlet enables you to return detailed information about the Web Services configuration settings currently in use in your organization.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins, RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration
```

The preceding command returns information about all the Web Services configuration settings currently in use in the organization.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 1 returns information about all the Web Services configuration settings currently in use in the organization.

Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 1 returns information about all the Web Services configuration settings currently in use in the organization.

Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond
```

The command shown in Example 2 returns information about the Web Services configuration settings that have the Identity site:Redmond.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 returns information about the Web Services configuration settings that have the Identity site:Redmond.

Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 2 returns information about the Web Services configuration settings that have the Identity site:Redmond.

Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Filter "site:*"
```

Example 3 returns all the Web Services configuration settings that have been assigned at the site scope.
To do this, the Filter parameter is included when calling Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration; the filter value "site:*" ensures that only those settings that have an Identity that begins with the string value "site:" are returned.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 returns all the Web Services configuration settings that have been assigned at the site scope.
To do this, the Filter parameter is included when calling Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration; the filter value "site:*" ensures that only those settings that have an Identity that begins with the string value "site:" are returned.

Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Filter "site:*"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 3 returns all the Web Services configuration settings that have been assigned at the site scope.

### -------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.UsePinAuth -eq $False}
```

In Example 4, the command returns all the Web Services configuration settings that do not allow personal identification number (PIN) authentication.
This is done by first calling Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration to return all the Web Services configuration settings currently in use.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those settings where the UsePinAuth property is equal to False.
