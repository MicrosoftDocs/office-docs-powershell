# Test-CsVoicePolicy

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Tests a telephone number against a voice policy and determines which voice route would be used against that policy for that number.

**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

Tests a telephone number against a voice policy and determines which voice route would be used against that policy for that number.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Test-CsVoicePolicy -TargetNumber <PhoneNumber> -VoicePolicy <VoicePolicy>
 [-RouteSettings <PstnRoutingSettings>] [-Force] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Voice policies are tied to voice routes through public switched telephone network (PSTN) usages.
A call from a user who has been assigned a particular voice policy can only be sent through a route that has a PSTN usage matching a usage on the policy as well as a number pattern that matches the number dialed.
Call the Test-CsVoicePolicy cmdlet to determine which (if any) route will be used to route a call from a user with a particular voice policy, as well as what phone usage ties the policy to the route.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Test-CsVoicePolicy cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself) run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Test-CsVoicePolicy"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsVoicePolicy -Identity site:Redmond | Test-CsVoicePolicy -TargetNumber "+14255559999"
```

This example runs a voice policy test against the voice policy with the Identity site:Redmond.
First the Get-CsVoicePolicy cmdlet is run to retrieve the policy with the Identity site:Redmond.
That policy object is then piped to the Test-CsVoicePolicy cmdlet, where the policy is tested against the telephone number +14255559999.
The output will be the first voice route (based on the Priority property of the route) that has a number pattern matching the TargetNumber value and a phone usage matching a phone usage in the policy.
If no matching route is found (for example, if the number pattern matches the pattern for an 11-digit number and you supply a 7-digit number) a null value will be returned.

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
$a = Get-CsVoicePolicy -Identity site:Redmond
Test-CsVoicePolicy -TargetNumber "+14255559999" -VoicePolicy $a
```

Example 2 is identical to Example 1 except that instead of piping the results of the Get operation directly to the Test cmdlet, the object is first stored in the variable $a and then is passed as the value to the parameter VoicePolicy to be used as the policy against which the test will run.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 is identical to Example 1 except that instead of piping the results of the Get operation directly to the Test cmdlet, the object is first stored in the variable $a and then is passed as the value to the parameter VoicePolicy to be used as the policy against which the test will run.

$a = Get-CsVoicePolicy -Identity site:Redmond

Test-CsVoicePolicy -TargetNumber "+14255559999" -VoicePolicy $a

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

Example 2 is identical to Example 1 except that instead of piping the results of the Get operation directly to the Test-CsVoicePolicy cmdlet, the object is first stored in the variable $a and then is passed as the value to the parameter VoicePolicy to be used as the policy against which the test will run.

$a = Get-CsVoicePolicy -Identity site:Redmond

Test-CsVoicePolicy -TargetNumber "+14255559999" -VoicePolicy $a

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsVoicePolicy | Test-CsVoicePolicy -TargetNumber "+12065559999"
```

This example runs a voice policy test against all voice policies defined within the Lync Server 2010 deployment.
First the Get-CsVoicePolicy cmdlet is run (with no parameters) to retrieve all the voice policies.
The collection of policies that is returned is then piped to the Test-CsVoicePolicy cmdlet, where each policy in the collection is checked for a matching route based on the target phone number provided (+12065559999) and phone usages.
The output will be a list of matching routes along with the phone usages that were matched.
