## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

This cmdlet removes a named voice normalization rule.
These rules are a required part of phone authorization and call routing.
They define the requirements for converting (or translating) numbers from an internal Lync Server 2010 format to a standard (E.164) format.
An understanding of regular expressions is helpful in order to define number patterns that will be translated.

Rules that are removed by using this cmdlet will be deleted from the dial plans of the organization, so they won't be returned by the Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule cmdlet and will not appear in the NormalizationRules property returned by a call to the Get-CsDialPlan cmdlet.
This means that calling Remove-CsVoiceNormalizationRule could leave a dial plan with no normalization rules.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsVoiceNormalizationRule cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsVoiceNormalizationRule"}
