## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsServerApplication [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Server applications refer to the individual programs that run under Lync Server 2010.
The Remove-CsServerApplication cmdlet provides a way for administrators to remove any application running as part of Lync Server.
Note that deleting a server application is not the same thing as uninstalling that application.
When you run Remove-CsServerApplication, the application no longer runs under Lync Server.
However, the software itself is not uninstalled, and the application can be re-enabled by running the New-CsServerApplication cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsServerApplication cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsServerApplication }

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Remove-CsServerApplication -Identity "service:EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor"
```

In Example 1, the server application that has the Identity service: EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor is removed.
Because Identities must be unique, this command will never delete more than a single application.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 1, the server application that has the Identity service: EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor is removed.
Because Identities must be unique, this command will never delete more than a single application.

Remove-CsServerApplication -Identity "service:EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 1, the server application that has the Identity service: EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor is removed.
Because Identities must be unique, this command will never delete more than a single application.

Remove-CsServerApplication -Identity "service:EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor"

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsServerApplication | Where-Object {$_.Critical -eq $False} | Remove-CsServerApplication
```

In Example 2, all the non-critical server applications are removed.
To carry out this task, the command first calls Get-CsServerApplication in order to return a collection of all the server applications currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to Where-Object, which picks all the applications where the Critical property is equal to False.
This filtered collection is then piped to Remove-CsServerApplication, which deletes each item in the collection.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

In Example 2, all the non-critical server applications are removed.
To carry out this task, the command first calls Get-CsServerApplication in order to return a collection of all the server applications currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to Where-Object, which picks all the applications where the Critical property is equal to False.
This filtered collection is then piped to Remove-CsServerApplication, which deletes each item in the collection.

Get-CsServerApplication | Where-Object {$_.Critical -eq $False} | Remove-CsServerApplication

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

In Example 2, all the non-critical server applications are removed.
To carry out this task, the command first calls the Get-CsServerApplication cmdlet in order to return a collection of all the server applications currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks all the applications where the Critical property is equal to False.
This filtered collection is then piped to the Remove-CsServerApplication cmdlet, which deletes each item in the collection.

Get-CsServerApplication | Where-Object {$_.Critical -eq $False} | Remove-CsServerApplication

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsServerApplication -Filter "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/*" | Remove-CsServerApplication
```

The preceding command deletes all the server applications that have been configured for use by the service EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, Get-CsServerApplication is used along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/*" returns all the applications that have an Identity that begins with the characters "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/".
In turn, that collection is piped to Remove-CsServerApplication, which deletes each application from the EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 3 deletes all the server applications that have been configured for use by the service EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, Get-CsServerApplication is used along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/*" returns all the applications that have an Identity that begins with the characters "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/".
In turn, that collection is piped to Remove-CsServerApplication, which deletes each application from the EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

Get-CsServerApplication -Filter "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/*" | Remove-CsServerApplication

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 3 deletes all the server applications that have been configured for use by the service EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, the Get-CsServerApplication cmdlet is used along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/*" returns all the applications that have an Identity that begins with the characters "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/".
In turn, that collection is piped to the Remove-CsServerApplication cmdlet, which deletes each application from the EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

Get-CsServerApplication -Filter "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/*" | Remove-CsServerApplication
