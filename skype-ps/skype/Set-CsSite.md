## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Lync Server 2010 introduces a new concept to the Lync Server topology: sites.
Sites (which should not be confused with Active Directory sites or Microsoft Exchange Server sites) are a collection of Lync Server pools and servers that are typically organized according to geography and network bandwidth.
For example, if all your computers in Redmond are located on the same local area network with high-speed, low-latency connections, you might designate a Redmond site that encompasses those computers.
If your computers in Dublin are located on their own local area network, and share high-speed, low-latency connections, then you might create a separate Dublin site as well.
Sites also play a key role in Lync Server management: many policies and settings can be configured at the site scope, making it easy to do such things as apply one set of dial plans to users in Redmond and a different set of dial plans to users in Dublin.

Sites are created by using Topology Builder, and any changes to the site infrastructure (for example, adding new pools) must also be made by using Topology Builder.
However, you can use the Set-CsSite cmdlet to change the display name, the description, and the federation route of any site in your organization.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Set-CsSite cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsSite"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsSite -Identity Redmond -Description "Full-time employees in Redmond, WA."
```

The command shown in Example 1 modifies the Description property for the Redmond site (-Identity Redmond).

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 modifies the Description property for the Redmond site (-Identity Redmond).

Set-CsSite -Identity Redmond -Description "Full-time employees in Redmond, WA."

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 modifies the Description property for the Redmond site (-Identity Redmond).

Set-CsSite -Identity Redmond -Description "Full-time employees in Redmond, WA."

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Set-CsSite -Identity Redmond -DisplayName "US Headquarters"
```

The preceding command changes the display name for the Redmond site to "US Headquarters".

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 changes the display name for the Redmond site to "US Headquarters".

Set-CsSite -Identity Redmond -DisplayName "US Headquarters"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 changes the display name for the Redmond site to "US Headquarters".

Set-CsSite -Identity Redmond -DisplayName "US Headquarters"

### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsSite | Where-Object {$_.Description -eq $Null} | ForEach-Object {Set-CsSite $_.Identity -Description "Litwareinc.com"}
```

The command shown in Example 3 locates all the sites that do not have a Description, and then assigns each of those sites the generic description "Litwareinc.com." To do this, the command first calls Get-CsSite without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the Lync Server sites.
The returned collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those sites where the Description property is equal to (-eq) a null value ($Null).
These sites are then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet.
This cmdlet takes each item in the collection and uses Set-CsSite to modify the value of the Description property.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 3 locates all the sites that do not have a Description, and then assigns each of those sites the generic description "Litwareinc.com." To do this, the command first calls Get-CsSite without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the Lync Server sites.
The returned collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those sites where the Description property is equal to (-eq) a null value ($Null).
These sites are then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet.
This cmdlet takes each item in the collection and uses Set-CsSite to modify the value of the Description property.

Get-CsSite | Where-Object {$_.Description -eq $Null} | ForEach-Object {Set-CsSite $_.Identity -Description "Litwareinc.com"}

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 3 locates all the sites that do not have a Description, and then assigns each of those sites the generic description "Litwareinc.com." To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsSite cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the Skype for Business Server 2015 sites.
The returned collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those sites where the Description property is equal to (-eq) a null value ($Null).
These sites are then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet.
This cmdlet takes each item in the collection and uses the Set-CsSite cmdlet to modify the value of the Description property.

Get-CsSite | Where-Object {$_.Description -eq $Null} | ForEach-Object {Set-CsSite $_.Identity -Description "Litwareinc.com"}
