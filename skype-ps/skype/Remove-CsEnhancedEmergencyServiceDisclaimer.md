## SYNTAX

Remove-CsEnhancedEmergencyServiceDisclaimer [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013

In order for an Enterprise Voice implementation to provide E9-1-1 service, locations must be mapped to ports, subnets, switches, and wireless access points to identify the caller's location.
When the caller is connecting from outside one of these mapped points, he must enter his location manually for it to be received by emergency services.
This cmdlet removes the text string that will be displayed to users who choose not to enter their location information.
This message will be displayed only if the LocationRequired property of the user's location policy is set to Disclaimer.
(You can retrieve location policy settings by calling Get-CsLocationPolicy.) After calling this cmdlet, a blank message will be displayed to users in this case.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsEnhancedEmergencyServiceDisclaimer cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:
