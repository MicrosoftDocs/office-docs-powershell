```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Proxy servers provide a way for users outside your internal network to access resources on your internal network.
Each proxy server must be associated with a realm; realms (also known as protection domains) indicate where a user's logon credentials should be processed.
By default, Microsoft Lync Server 2010 uses SIP Communications Service as its default realm; however, it is possible to change the realm employed by a proxy server.
If you change the realm and then want to revert back to using the default realm, you can do so by creating a SipProxy.UseDefault object, and then assigning that object to the Realm property of the appropriate proxy server (or servers).

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsSipProxyUseDefault cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsSipProxyUseDefault"}
