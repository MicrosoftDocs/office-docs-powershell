## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

Conferencing is an important part of Microsoft Lync Server 2010: conferencing enables groups of users (as few as two people to as many as 250 people) to come together online to view slides and video, share applications, exchange files, and otherwise communicate and collaborate.

It's important for administrators to maintain control over conferences and conference settings.
In some cases, there might be security concerns: by default, anyone, including unauthenticated users, can participate in meetings and save any of the slides or handouts distributed during those meetings.
In other cases, there might be bandwidth concerns: having a multitude of simultaneous meetings, each involving hundreds of participants and each featuring video feeds and file sharing, has the potential to cause problems with your network.
In addition, there might be occasional legal concerns.
For example, by default meeting participants are allowed to make annotations on shared content; however, these annotations are not saved when the meeting is archived.
If your organization is required to keep a record of all electronic communication, you might want to disable annotations.

Needing to manage conferencing settings is one thing; actually managing these settings is another.
In Lync Server 2010, conferences are managed by using conferencing policies.
(In previous versions of the software, these were known as meeting policies.) As noted, conferencing policies determine the features and capabilities that can be used in a conference, including everything from whether or not the conference can include IP audio and video to the maximum number of people who can attend a meeting.
Conferencing policies can be configured at the global scope; at the site scope; or at the per-user scope.
This provides administrators with enormous flexibility when it comes to deciding which capabilities will be made available to which users.

The New-CsConferencingPolicy cmdlet enables you to create new conferencing policies at either the site or the per-user scope.
You cannot create a new global policy because the global policy already exists.
However, you can modify the property values of the global policy by using Set-CsConferencingPolicy.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsConferencingPolicy cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object  {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsConferencingPolicy"}

Conferencing is an important part of Skype for Business Server 2015: conferencing enables groups of users to come together online to view slides and video, share applications, exchange files, and otherwise communicate and collaborate.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsConferencingPolicy -Identity SalesConferencingPolicy -MaxMeetingSize 50
```

The preceding command uses New-CsConferencingPolicy to create a new conferencing policy with the Identity SalesConferencingPolicy.
This policy will use all the default values for a conferencing policy except one: MaxMeetingSize; in this example, the maximum size for a meeting will be set to 50 instead of the default value of 250.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 uses New-CsConferencingPolicy to create a new conferencing policy with the Identity SalesConferencingPolicy.
This policy will use all the default values for a conferencing policy except one: MaxMeetingSize; in this example, the maximum size for a meeting will be set to 50 instead of the default value of 250.

New-CsConferencingPolicy -Identity SalesConferencingPolicy -MaxMeetingSize 50
