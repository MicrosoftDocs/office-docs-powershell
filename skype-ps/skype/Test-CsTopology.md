## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

The Test-CsTopology cmdlet provides a way for you to verify that Lync Server 2010 is functioning correctly at a global level.
By default, the cmdlet checks your entire Lync Server infrastructure, verifying that the required services are running and that the appropriate permissions have been set for these services and for the universal security groups created when you install Lync Server.

In addition to verifying the validity of Lync Server as a whole, Test-CsTopology also lets you check the validity of a specific service.
For example, this command checks the state of the A/V Conferencing server on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com:

Test-CsTopology -Service "ConferencingServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com".

Who can run this cmdlet: To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Test-CsTopology"}
