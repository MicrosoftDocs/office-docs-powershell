## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The Set-CsPersistentChatActiveServer cmdlet allows administrators to essentially enable or disable the Persistent Chat service on one or more servers in a Persistent Chat pool.
Servers that appear on the active servers list are able to accept new client connections.
Servers that do not appear on the list are not able to accept new client connections.
(However, the server will continue to any client connections that were made before the server was removed from the list.) To enable the Persistent Chat service on a Persistent Chat server, add that server to the active server list.
To disable the service, remove the server from the active server list.

To enable/disable the Persistent Chat service on all the servers in a pool, use the Set-CsPersistentChatState cmdlet.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Set-CsPersistentChatActiveServer"}
