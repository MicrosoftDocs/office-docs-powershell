## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

This cmdlet creates a policy that configures a user account enabled for Microsoft Lync Server 2010 or Office Communications Server to use an Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) hosted voice mail service.
The policy determines how to route unanswered calls to the user to a hosted Exchange UM service.

A user must be enabled for Exchange UM hosted voice mail for this policy to take effect.
You can call the Get-CsUser cmdlet and check the HostedVoiceMail property to determine whether a user is enabled for hosted voice mail.
(A value of True means the user is enabled.)

Policies created at the site scope will be automatically assigned to the users homed on those sites.
Policies created at the per-user scope must be assigned to users or contact objects with the Grant-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)
```
New-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond -Destination ExUM.fabrikam.com -Description "Hosted voicemail policy for Redmond users." -Organization "corp1.litwareinc.com, corp2.litwareinc.com"
```

This command creates a new hosted voice mail policy named ExRedmond.
(The fact that no scope is specified means that this policy can be assigned to individual users or contacts.) This policy defines the Exchange UM destination for this policy to be at FQDN ExUM.fabrikam.com.
In addition, the Lync Server 2010 users of this policy can be spread across the corp1 and corp2 organizations of litwareinc.
This policy is described as (has a Description parameter value of) "Hosted voice mail property for Redmond users."

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

This command creates a new hosted voice mail policy named ExRedmond.
(The fact that no scope is specified means that this policy can be assigned to individual users or contacts.) This policy defines the Exchange UM destination for this policy to be at FQDN ExUM.fabrikam.com.
In addition, the Lync Server users of this policy can be spread across the corp1 and corp2 organizations of litwareinc.
This policy is described as (has a Description parameter value of) "Hosted voice mail property for Redmond users."

New-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond -Destination ExUM.fabrikam.com -Description "Hosted voicemail policy for Redmond users." -Organization "corp1.litwareinc.com, corp2.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

This command creates a new hosted voice mail policy named ExRedmond.
(The fact that no scope is specified means that this policy can be assigned to individual users or contacts.) This policy defines the Exchange UM destination for this policy to be at FQDN ExUM.fabrikam.com.
In addition, the Skype for Business Server 2015 users of this policy can be spread across the corp1 and corp2 organizations of litwareinc.
This policy is described as (has a Description parameter value of) "Hosted voice mail property for Redmond users."

New-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond -Destination ExUM.fabrikam.com -Description "Hosted voicemail policy for Redmond users." -Organization "corp1.litwareinc.com, corp2.litwareinc.com"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The commands shown in Example 2 are a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the new hosted voicemail policy is assigned to the Lync Online tenant with the tenant ID 73d355dd-ce5d-4ab9-bf49-7b822c18dd98.
To create a new policy for a Lync Online tenant you must include the InMemory parameter and store the resulting policy in a variable.
That's what happens in the first command, with the new policy stored in a variable named $x.
Note, too that you must set the Identity to Global and the Tenant parameter to the appropriate tenant ID.

To create the new policy, the second command then calls Set-CsHostedVoiceMailPolicy along with the Instance parameter and the Tenant parameter.

$x = New-CsHostedVoiceMailPolicy -Identity global -Tenant "73d355dd-ce5d-4ab9-bf49-7b822c18dd98" -Destination ExUM.fabrikam.com -Description "Hosted voicemail policy for Redmond users." -Organization "corp1.litwareinc.com, corp2.litwareinc.com"

Set-CsHostedVoiceMailPolicy -Instance $x -Tenant "73d355dd-ce5d-4ab9-bf49-7b822c18dd98"

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The commands shown in Example 2 are a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the new hosted voicemail policy is assigned to the Skype for Business Online tenant with the tenant ID 73d355dd-ce5d-4ab9-bf49-7b822c18dd98.
To create a new policy for a Skype for Business Online tenant you must include the InMemory parameter and store the resulting policy in a variable.
That's what happens in the first command, with the new policy stored in a variable named $x.
Note, too that you must set the Identity to Global and the Tenant parameter to the appropriate tenant ID.

To create the new policy, the second command then calls the Set-CsHostedVoiceMailPolicy cmdlet along with the Instance parameter and the Tenant parameter.

$x = New-CsHostedVoiceMailPolicy -Identity global -Tenant "73d355dd-ce5d-4ab9-bf49-7b822c18dd98" -Destination ExUM.fabrikam.com -Description "Hosted voicemail policy for Redmond users." -Organization "corp1.litwareinc.com, corp2.litwareinc.com"

Set-CsHostedVoiceMailPolicy -Instance $x -Tenant "73d355dd-ce5d-4ab9-bf49-7b822c18dd98"
