**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015

This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Unpublish-CsLisConfiguration [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

In order to implement Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) in Microsoft Lync Server 2010, you must create a location mapping (called a wiremap).
This mapping includes matching physical addresses to ports, subnets, switches, and wireless access points so emergency calls made over an Enterprise Voice connection will reach the nearest emergency operator and provide that operator with the correct location of the caller.
This mapping configuration, created by calling cmdlets such as Set-CsLisPort and Set-CsLisSubnet, is stored in the location configuration database.
A configuration can be committed from the location configuration database to the Central Management store by calling the Publish-CsLisConfiguration cmdlet, which allows for replication of the data to the Location Information Server.
The Unpublish-CsLisConfiguration cmdlet removes the LIS configuration from the Central Management store.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Unpublish-CsLisConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Unpublish-CsLisConfiguration"}
