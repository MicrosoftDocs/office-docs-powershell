## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsConferenceDirectory [-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

When you create a dial-in conferencing Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) those URIs are assigned unique SIP addresses.
However, SIP addresses are difficult to translate to devices that are not SIP-aware; for example, a public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephone can't translate a SIP address.
Because of that, Microsoft Lync Server 2010 uses conference directories as a way to help these devices locate, and connect to, dial-in conferences.
This is done by creating a SIP conference directory that is associated with each dial-in conferencing URI, and is identified by an integer value rather than a SIP URI.
PSTN telephones and other devices can then use these numbers (rather than a SIP URI) when connecting to conferences; the directory number is included in the PSTN conference identification users enter when connecting to a dial-in conference.

Conference directories are created by using the New-CsConferenceDirectory cmdlet.
Occasionally, you might need to delete one or more of these directories; for example, you might need to decommission the pool where the directories were hosted.
Conference directories can be removed by calling the Remove-CsConferenceDirectory cmdlet.
Note that if you need to move a directory from one pool to another, you can do so by calling the Move-CsConferenceDirectory cmdlet.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsConferenceDirectory cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsConferenceDirectory"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Remove-CsConferenceDirectory -Identity 2
```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes the conference directory with the Identity 2.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes the conference directory with the Identity 2.

Remove-CsConferenceDirectory -Identity 2

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes the conference directory with the Identity 2.

Remove-CsConferenceDirectory -Identity 2

### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------ (Lync Server 2010)
```
Get-CsConferenceDirectory | Where-Object {$_.ServiceID -match "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} | Remove-CsConferenceDirectory
```

The preceding command deletes all the conference directories found on the service UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsConferenceDirectory without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the conference directories currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those directories hosted on the service UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In turn, that filtered collection is piped to, and deleted by, the Remove-CsConferenceDirectory cmdlet.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2013)
```

```

Example 2 deletes all the conference directories found on the service UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, the command first calls Get-CsConferenceDirectory without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the conference directories currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those directories hosted on the service UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In turn, that filtered collection is piped to, and deleted by, the Remove-CsConferenceDirectory cmdlet.

Get-CsConferenceDirectory | Where-Object {$_.ServiceID -match "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} | Remove-CsConferenceDirectory

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

```

Example 2 deletes all the conference directories found on the service UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsConferenceDirectory cmdlet without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the conference directories currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those directories hosted on the service UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
