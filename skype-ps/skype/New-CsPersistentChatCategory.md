# New-CsPersistentChatCategory

## SYNOPSIS
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

Creates a new Persistent Chat category.
A Persistent Chat category represents a collection of Persistent Chat chat rooms.
Each chat room must be associated with a category.
Note that you cannot assign chat rooms to a category when you create that category.
Instead, existing rooms must later be assigned to a category by using the Set-CsPersistentChatRoom cmdlet.
However, new chat rooms can be assigned to the category at the same time the room is created.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013 Preview.

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2013

The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

Persistent Chat categories provide a way for administrators to organize, and manage, Persistent Chat chat rooms.
Categories provide a way for administrators to group related chat rooms; for example, all chat rooms used by the finance department can be grouped in the same category.
Likewise, categories provide a way for administrators to manage permissions to these rooms, dictating which users are allowed access to the rooms, which users are denied access to the rooms, and which users are allowed to create new chat rooms within the category.

Note that all chat rooms must belong to a category; you cannot create a chat room without assigning that room to a category.
That means that you must create at least one category before you can add any chat rooms to your Persistent Chat implementation.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsPersistentChatCategory"}

Lync Server Control Panel: To create a new Persistent Chat category using the Lync Server Control Panel, click Persistent Chat, click Category, and then click New.
