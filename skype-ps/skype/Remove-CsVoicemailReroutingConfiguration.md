Remove-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**Below Content Applies To:** Lync Server 2010

This cmdlet allows you to remove settings that determine where Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access calls are rerouted to over PSTN when IP connectivity is lost.

Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access are features of Exchange UM.
The Auto Attendant feature provides voice recognition and touch-tone control (dual-tone multifrequency, or DTMF) for outside callers to navigate a company's phone system to reach the desired department or employee or, in Message Taking Mode, to accept messages for users.
(Voice rerouting for Message Taking Mode is recommended.) Subscriber Access allows internal users to access their Microsoft Outlook mailbox from a phone.
The numbers provided by these settings allow callers to leave voice mail messages for Enterprise Voice users (the AutoAttendantNumber setting) and for those users to retrieve voice mail even if the IP connectivity from the Lync Server 2010 deployment at a remote site to Exchange UM in the data center is unavailable (the SubscriberAccessNumber setting).

Note that if you call this cmdlet to remove the Global settings, those settings will simply be reset to their defaults.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Remove-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Remove-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration"}
