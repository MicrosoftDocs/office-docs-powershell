# Learn How To Contribute
Anyone who is interested can contribute to the Microsoft Office PowerShell reference topics.
When you contribute your work will go directly into the Microsoft Office products and show up in Get-Help for the given Office cmdlet.

> Notice that if you are looking into contributing for the **PnP PowerShell cmdlets**, their documentation is automatically generated from the code, and you should be submitting your change towards the original code at https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-powershell. See, for example, how the attributes are used in the code for the [Get-PnPList](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/blob/master/Commands/Lists/GetList.cs) cmdlet.

# Quick Start

## Contribute using the GitHub website

[![Image of Quick Start video](images/edit_video_capture.jpg)](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/edit-powershell-cmdlet-in-github-dcd20227-3764-48ce-ad6e-763af8b48daf?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US)

1. Open your browser, log in to GitHub, and then navigate to https://github.com/microsoftdocs/office-docs-powershell
2. Browse to the file you want to edit. In this example, we will edit https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/office-docs-powershell/blob/master/teams/teams-ps/teams/New-Team.md and add a link in the Related Links section.
3. Click the Edit icon which looks like a pencil in the upper right corner.

4. Your browser will then open the file in an edit window. We want to add a link. So we scroll down to the Related Links section and add the link in the correct format.

**Note** Since you are likely not a maintainer of the Git repository, GitHub will automatically 'Fork' the project into your personal GitHub account. A fork is just an exact copy of the repository in your own account so that you have total access to make edits. You are now 'editing' a copy of the project in your own GitHub account. You can always find it again by looking at your GitHub Repositories in your GitHub Profile (drop-down from your name in the top right).

5. You can click the Preview changes link to see what the changes will look like.

   **IMPORTANT** The layout of headings and subheadings must follow a very specific schema that is required for PowerShell Get-Help.
   Any deviation will throw errors in the Pull Request. The schema can be found here: https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS/blob/master/platyPS.schema.md 

6. Once you are satisfied with your work, go to the **Propose file change** area at the bottom of the topic. Enter a title and other description information, and then click **Propose file change**.
