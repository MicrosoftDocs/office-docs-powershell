# Security & Compliance Center PowerShell

Security & Compliance Center PowerShell is the administrative interface that enables you to manage the features that are available in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and the Microsoft 365 compliance center from the command line. For example, you can use Security & Compliance Center PowerShell to perform Compliance Searches. The following articles provide information about using Security & Compliance Center PowerShell:

- To create a remote PowerShell session that supports both modern authentication and multi-factor authentication (MFA), see [Connect to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](connect-to-scc-powershell.md). Note that the connection instructions are different from Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) PowerShell (the _ConnectionUri_ value is different).

- To learn about the structure and layout of the cmdlet reference articles in Security & Compliance Center PowerShell, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](exchange-cmdlet-syntax.md).

Many of the cmdlets that are available in Security & Compliance Center PowerShell correspond to features that are only available in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, so the related cmdlets are exclusive to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell. But, some cmdlets that are available in Security & Compliance Center PowerShell have the same names and functionality as those in Exchange Online PowerShell (for example, [Get-User](/powershell/module/exchange/get-user)).

Also, some features that are available in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (for example, [anti-spam and anti-malware](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/anti-spam-and-anti-malware-protection) cmdlets are only available in [Exchange Online PowerShell](exchange-online-powershell.md)). Check the **Applies to** value in the cmdlet reference article to verify where the cmdlet actually resides.
