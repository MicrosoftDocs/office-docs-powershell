# Security & Compliance Center PowerShell

Security & Compliance Center PowerShell is the administrative interface that enables you to manage your Security & Compliance Center settings from the command line. For example, you can use Security & Compliance Center PowerShell to perform Compliance Searches and configure access to the Security & Compliance Center. The following topics provide information about using Security & Compliance Center PowerShell:

- To create a remote PowerShell session to the Security & Compliance Center, see [Connect to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](connect-to-scc-powershell.md). Note that the connection instructions are different from Exchange Online or Exchange Online Protection (the _ConnectionUri_ value is different).

- A cmdlet is a lightweight command that is imported into your local Windows PowerShell session. Note that some cmdlets are available only in the Security & Compliance Center. Other cmdlets have the same names and functionality as those in Exchange Online, but they are also available in the Security & Compliance Center.
