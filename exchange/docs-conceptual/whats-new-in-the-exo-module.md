## June 2023

- [Virtually all](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/deprecation-of-remote-powershell-rps-protocol-in-security-and/ba-p/3815432) Security & Compliance PowerShell cmdlets are now backed by the REST API, and REST API is used by default. To connect using remote PowerShell mode (which requires [Basic authentication in WinRM](exchange-online-powershell-v2.md#turn-on-basic-authentication-in-winrm)), use the _UseRPSSession_ switch in the **Connect-IPPSSession** command.

  For information about what's in this release, see [Version 3.2.0](exchange-online-powershell-v2.md#version-320).

## May 2023

- The end of support for remote PowerShell in Security & Compliance PowerShell has been announced. For more information, see [Announcing Deprecation of Remote PowerShell (RPS) Protocol in Exchange Online PowerShell](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/deprecation-of-remote-powershell-rps-protocol-in-security-and/ba-p/3815432).

- [Version 3.2.0-Preview4](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/3.2.0-Preview4) has been released.

  This version supports the Preview of Security & Compliance cmdlets backed by the REST API. Some, but not all cmdlets are supported. Basic authentication in WinRM is not required in Security & Compliance PowerShell for REST API cmdlets.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The default value of the _UseRPSSession_ switch in **Connect-IPSSession** is now the same as **Connect-ExchangeOnline**. To connect in REST API mode, don't use the _UseRPSSession_ switch in the **Connect-IPPSSession** command. To connect using remote PowerShell mode (which requires [Basic authentication in WinRM](exchange-online-powershell-v2.md#turn-on-basic-authentication-in-winrm)), use the _UseRPSSession_ switch in the **Connect-IPPSSession** command.
  >
  > REST API connections in the EXO V3 module require the PowerShellGet and PackageManagement modules. For more information, see [PowerShellGet for REST-based connections in Windows](exchange-online-powershell-v2.md#powershellget-for-rest-api-connections-in-windows).

## April 2023

- [Version 3.2.0-Preview3](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/3.2.0-Preview3) has been released.

  This version supports the Preview of Security & Compliance cmdlets backed by the REST API. Some, but not all cmdlets are supported. Basic authentication in WinRM is not required in Security & Compliance PowerShell for REST API cmdlets.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The default value of the _UseRPSSession_ switch in **Connect-IPSSession** is opposite of **Connect-ExchangeOnline**. To connect in REST API mode, use `-UseRPSSession:$false` in the **Connect-IPPSSession** command. To connect using remote PowerShell mode (which requires [Basic authentication in WinRM](exchange-online-powershell-v2.md#turn-on-basic-authentication-in-winrm)), don't use the _UseRPSSession_ switch in the **Connect-IPPSSession** command. The default behavior will change in a later version of the module as more Security & Compliance cmdlets are available in REST API mode.

## January 2023

- [Version 3.1.0](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/3.1.0) has been released.

  For information about what's in this release, see [Version 3.1.0](exchange-online-powershell-v2.md#version-310).

## December 2022

- The end of support for remote PowerShell in Exchange Online PowerShell (not in Security & Compliance PowerShell) has been announced. For more information, see [Announcing Deprecation of Remote PowerShell (RPS) Protocol in Exchange Online PowerShell](https://aka.ms/RPSDeprecation).

## September 2022

- Version 3.0.0 has been released, and is now known as the Exchange Online PowerShell V3 module (abbreviated as the EXO V3 module):
  - Version 3.0.0 is the Generally Availability (GA) release of the 2.0.6-PreviewX versions of the module.
  - All Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlets are now backed by the REST API. Basic authentication in WinRM is not required in Exchange Online PowerShell for REST API cmdlets.

    > [!TIP]
    > REST API connections in the EXO V3 module require the PowerShellGet and PackageManagement modules. For more information, see [PowerShellGet for REST-based connections in Windows](exchange-online-powershell-v2.md#powershellget-for-rest-api-connections-in-windows).
