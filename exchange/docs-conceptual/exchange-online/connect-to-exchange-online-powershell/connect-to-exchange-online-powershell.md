# Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell

Exchange Online PowerShell allows you to manage your Exchange Online settings from the command line. You use Windows PowerShell on your local computer to create a remote PowerShell session to Exchange Online. It's a simple three-step process where you enter your Office 365 credentials, provide the required connection settings, and then import the Exchange Online cmdlets into your local Windows PowerShell session so that you can use them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, you need to download and use the Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module. For more information, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell using multi-factor authentication](mfa-connect-to-exchange-online-powershell.md). <br/><br/> If you're a standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) customer (for example, you're using EOP to protect your on-premises email environment), use the connection instructions in [Connect to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell](../../exchange-eop/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell.md). If your standalone EOP subscription is Exchange Enterprise CAL with Services (includes data loss prevention (DLP) and reporting using web services), the connection instructions in this topic will work for you.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes

- You can use the following versions of Windows:

  - Windows 10

  - Windows 8.1

  - Windows Server 2019

  - Windows Server 2016

  - Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2

  - Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1)<sup>*</sup>

  - Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1<sup>*</sup>

    <sup>*</sup> For older versions of Windows, you need to install the Microsoft.NET Framework 4.5 or later and then an updated version of the Windows Management Framework: 3.0, 4.0, or 5.1 (only one). For more information, see [Installing the .NET Framework](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=257868), [Windows Management Framework 3.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=272757), [Windows Management Framework 4.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=391344), and [Windows Management Framework 5.1](https://aka.ms/wmf5download).

- Windows PowerShell needs to be configured to run scripts, and by default, it isn't. You'll get the following error when you try to connect:

  `Files cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. Provide a valid certificate with which to sign the files.`

  To require all PowerShell scripts that you download from the internet are signed by a trusted publisher, run the following command in an elevated Windows PowerShell window (a Windows PowerShell window you open by selecting **Run as administrator**):

  ```PowerShell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```

  You need to configure this setting only once on your computer, not every time you connect.

> [!TIP]
> Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at: [Exchange Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=267542), or [Exchange Online Protection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=285351).

## Connect to Exchange Online

1. On your local computer, open Windows PowerShell and run the following command.

   ```PowerShell
   $UserCredential = Get-Credential
   ```

   In the **Windows PowerShell Credential Request** dialog box, type your work or school account and password, and then click **OK**.

2. Run the following command:

   ```PowerShell
   $Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection
   ```

   **Notes**:

   - For Office 365 operated by 21Vianet, use the _ConnectionUri_ value: `https://partner.outlook.cn/PowerShell`

   - For Office 365 Germany, use the _ConnectionUri_ value: `https://outlook.office.de/powershell-liveid/`

   - For Office 365 Government Community Cloud High (GCC High), use the _ConnectionUri_ value: `https://outlook.office365.us/powershell-liveid/`

   - If you're behind a proxy server, run this command first: `$ProxyOptions = New-PSSessionOption -ProxyAccessType <Value>`, where the _ProxyAccessType_ value is `IEConfig`, `WinHttpConfig`, or `AutoDetect`.

     Then, add the following parameter and value to the end of the $Session = ... command: `-SessionOption $ProxyOptions`.

     For more information, see [New-PSSessionOption](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/new-pssessionoption).

3. Run the following command:

   ```PowerShell
   Import-PSSession $Session -DisableNameChecking
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to disconnect the remote PowerShell session when you're finished. If you close the Windows PowerShell window without disconnecting the session, you could use up all the remote PowerShell sessions available to you, and you'll need to wait for the sessions to expire. To disconnect the remote PowerShell session, run the following command.

```PowerShell
Remove-PSSession $Session
```

## How do you know this worked?

After Step 3, the Exchange Online cmdlets are imported into your local Windows PowerShell session and tracked by a progress bar. If you don't receive any errors, you connected successfully. A quick test is to run an Exchange Online cmdlet, for example, **Get-Mailbox**, and see the results.

If you receive errors, check the following requirements:

- A common problem is an incorrect password. Run the three steps again and pay close attention to the user name and password you enter in Step 1.

- To help prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, you're limited to three open remote PowerShell connections to your Exchange Online organization.

- The account you use to connect to Exchange Online must be enabled for remote PowerShell. For more information, see [Enable or disable access to Exchange Online PowerShell](../disable-access-to-exchange-online-powershell.md).

- TCP port 80 traffic needs to be open between your local computer and Office 365. It's probably open, but it's something to consider if your organization has a restrictive internet access policy.

- If your organization uses federated authentication, and your identity provider (IDP) and/or security token service (STS) isn't publicly available, you can't use a federated account to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. Instead, create and use a non-federated account in Office 365 to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell.
