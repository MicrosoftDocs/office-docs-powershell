# Exchange Online Protection PowerShell

Exchange Online Protection PowerShell is the administrative interface that enables you to manage security features in Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations from the command line. For example, you can use Exchange Online Protection PowerShell to configure anti-spam policies, mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) and connectors.

> [!TIP]
> Microsoft 365 organizations with cloud mailboxes (Microsoft 365 A3/E3/G3, A5/E5/G5, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, etc.) use [Exchange Online PowerShell](exchange-online-powershell.md) to manage these same features.

Exchange Online Protection PowerShell includes the following environments:

- **Standalone EOP organizations**: Your Microsoft 365 subscription includes no Exchange Online mailboxes, because you use EOP to protect your on-premises email environment.
- **Exchange Enterprise CAL with Services**: The licenses for your on-premises Exchange organization include Exchange Enterprise CAL with Services (EOP is one of the services).
