# Exchange Online Protection PowerShell for cloud protection of on-premises email environments

Exchange Online Protection PowerShell is the administrative interface that enables you to manage cloud protection features for on-premises email environments from the command line. For example, you can use Exchange Online Protection PowerShell to configure anti-spam policies, mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) and connectors to support on-premises email protection.

> [!TIP]
> All organizations with cloud mailboxes (Microsoft 365 A3/E3/G3, A5/E5/G5, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, etc.) use [Exchange Online PowerShell](exchange-online-powershell.md) to manage these same features for cloud email protection.

Exchange Online Protection PowerShell for cloud protection of on-premises email environments is available in the following scenarios:

- **On-premises email environments (not just Microsoft Exchange)**: Mail from the internet passes through cloud protection and filtering before delivery to on-premises recipients. The cloud environment contains no mailboxes.
- **Exchange Enterprise CAL with Services**: The licenses for your on-premises Exchange organization include Exchange Enterprise CAL with Services (cloud protection of on-premises mailboxes is one of the services).
