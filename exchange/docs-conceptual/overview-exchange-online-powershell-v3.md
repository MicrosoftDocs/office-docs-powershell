# About the Exchange Online PowerShell V3 module

The Exchange Online PowerShell V3 module (EXO V3 module) supports modern authentication and enables the use of Exchange Online cmdlets via REST API calls. EXO V3 is an upgrade over the V2 module, which had RPS cmdlets and 9 REST-based EXO cmdlets. The V3 module's preview version was called the V2.0.6 preview, and therefore there are similarities between this preview module and the V3 Module.

The EXO V3 module includes REST equivalents of all cmdlets available within the V2 module, and new features will be introduced later.

> [!NOTE]
> The cmdlets for Security & Compliance PowerShell and standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) PowerShell still have only their RPS versions available. The REST equivalents of these cmdlets should be available in the V3 Module in the upcoming releases.
