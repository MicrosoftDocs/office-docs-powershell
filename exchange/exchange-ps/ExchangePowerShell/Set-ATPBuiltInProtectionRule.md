# Set-ATPBuiltInProtectionRule

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Set-ATPBuiltInProtectionRule cmdlet to modify the rule for the Built-in protection preset security policy that effectively provides default policies for Safe Links and Safe Attachments in Microsoft Defender for Office 365. The rule specifies exceptions to the policy.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-ATPBuiltInProtectionRule [-Identity] <DehydrateableRuleIdParameter>
 [-Comments <String>]
 [-Confirm]

## DESCRIPTION
For more information about preset security policies in PowerShell, see [Preset security policies in Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/preset-security-policies#preset-security-policies-in-exchange-online-powershell).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Different types of recipient exceptions use OR logic (the recipient must satisfy **any** of the specified exceptions). For more information, see [Profiles in preset security policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/preset-security-policies#profiles-in-preset-security-policies).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-ATPBuiltInProtectionRule -Identity "ATP Built-In Protection Rule" -ExceptIfSentToMemberOf "Test Group1","Test Group2"
```

This example provides exceptions to the Built-in protection preset security policy for members of the specified groups.

### Example 2
```powershell
Set-ATPBuiltInProtectionRule -Identity "ATP Built-In Protection Rule" -ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs (Get-AcceptedDomain).Name
```

This example provides exceptions to the Built-in protection preset security policy for recipients in all accepted domains. To see all of your accepted domains, run the following command: `Get-AcceptedDomain | Format-List Name,DomainName`.

### Example 3
```powershell
Set-ATPBuiltInProtectionRule -Identity "ATP Built-In Protection Rule" -ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs $null -ExceptIfSentTo $null -ExceptIfSentToMemberOf $null
```

This example remove all exceptions from the Built-in protection preset security policy.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Online

The Identity parameter specifies the rule that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the rule. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

The name of the only rule is ATP Built-In Protection Rule.

```yaml
Type: DehydrateableRuleIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Comments

> Applicable: Exchange Online

The Comments parameter specifies informative comments for the rule, such as what the rule is used for or how it has changed over time. The length of the comment can't exceed 1024 characters.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Online

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs

> Applicable: Exchange Online

The ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients with email addresses in the specified domains. You can specify multiple domains separated by commas.

```yaml
Type: Word[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfSentTo

> Applicable: Exchange Online

The ExceptIfSentTo parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients in messages. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

- Name
- Alias
- Distinguished name (DN)
- Canonical DN
- Email address
- GUID

You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfSentToMemberOf

> Applicable: Exchange Online

The ExceptIfSentToMemberOf parameter specifies an exception that looks for messages sent to members of groups. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

- Name
- Alias
- Distinguished name (DN)
- Canonical DN
- Email address
- GUID

Dynamic distribution groups are not supported.

You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

If you remove the group after you create the rule, no exception is made for messages that are sent to members of the group.

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Online

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
