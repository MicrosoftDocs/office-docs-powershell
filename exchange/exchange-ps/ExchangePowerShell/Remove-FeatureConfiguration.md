## SYNTAX

```
Remove-FeatureConfiguration [-Identity] <PolicyIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
To use this cmdlet in Security & Compliance PowerShell, you need to be assigned permissions. For more information, see [Permissions in Security & Compliance](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=511920).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-FeatureConfiguration -Identity "Engineering Group"
```

This example removes the specified feature configuration.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Security & Compliance

The Identity policy specifies the feature configuration that you want to remove. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the configuration. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

```yaml
Type: PolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Security & Compliance

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Security & Compliance

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
