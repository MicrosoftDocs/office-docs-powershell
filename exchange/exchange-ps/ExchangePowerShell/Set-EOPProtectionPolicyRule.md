# Set-EOPProtectionPolicyRule

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Set-EOPProtectionPolicyRule cmdlet to modify rules associated with the built-in security features for all cloud mailboxes in preset security policies.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## DESCRIPTION
For more information about preset security policies in PowerShell, see [Preset security policies in Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/preset-security-policies#preset-security-policies-in-exchange-online-powershell).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Different types of recipient conditions use AND logic (the recipient must satisfy **all** specified conditions). Different types of recipient exceptions use OR logic (the recipient must satisfy **any** of the specified exceptions). For more information, see [Profiles in preset security policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/preset-security-policies#profiles-in-preset-security-policies).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this article lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you might not have access to some parameters if they aren't included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-EOPProtectionPolicyRule -Identity "Standard Preset Security Policy" -ExceptIfSentToMemberOf "Test Group1","Test Group2"
```

This example provides exceptions to the built-in security features for all cloud mailboxes in the Standard preset security policy for members of the specified groups.

### Example 2
```powershell
Set-EOPProtectionPolicyRule -Identity "Standard Preset Security Policy" -SentTo $null -ExceptIfSentTo $null -SentToMemberOf $null -ExceptIfSentToMemberOf $null -RecipientDomainIs $null -ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs $null
```

This example removes all conditions and exceptions from the Standard preset security policy. No restrictions are placed on who the Defender for Office 365 protections apply to.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The Identity parameter specifies the rule that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the rule. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

By default, the available rules (if they exist) are named Standard Preset Security Policy and Strict Preset Security Policy.

```yaml
Type: RuleIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Comments

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The Comments parameter specifies informative comments for the rule, such as what the rule is used for or how it has changed over time. The length of the comment can't exceed 1024 characters.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients with email addresses in the specified domains. You can specify multiple domains separated by commas.

```yaml
Type: Word[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfSentTo

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The ExceptIfSentTo parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients in messages. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

- Name
- Alias
- Distinguished name (DN)
- Canonical DN
- Email address
- GUID

You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfSentToMemberOf

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The ExceptIfSentToMemberOf parameter specifies an exception that looks for messages sent to members of groups. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

- Name
- Alias
- Distinguished name (DN)
- Canonical DN
- Email address
- GUID

You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

If you remove the group after you create the rule, no exception is made for messages that are sent to members of the group.

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the rule. The maximum length is 64 characters.

By default, the rules are named Standard Preset Security Policy or Strict Preset Security Policy. We highly recommend that you use the default rule names for clarity and consistency.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Priority

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The Priority parameter specifies a priority value for the rule that determines the order of rule processing. A lower integer value indicates a higher priority, the value 0 is the highest priority, and rules can't have the same priority value.

The default value for the rule that's associated with the Strict preset security policy is 0, and the default value for the rule that's associated with the Standard preset security policy is 1.

You must use the default value for the rule.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RecipientDomainIs

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The RecipientDomainIs parameter specifies a condition that looks for recipients with email addresses in the specified domains. You can specify multiple domains separated by commas.

```yaml
Type: Word[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SentTo

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The SentTo parameter specifies a condition that looks for recipients in messages. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

- Name
- Alias
- Distinguished name (DN)
- Canonical DN
- Email address
- GUID

You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SentToMemberOf

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The SentToMemberOf parameter specifies a condition that looks for messages sent to members of distribution groups, dynamic distribution groups, or mail-enabled security groups. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

- Name
- Alias
- Distinguished name (DN)
- Canonical DN
- Email address
- GUID

You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

If you remove the group after you create the rule, no action is taken on messages that are sent to members of the group.

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Built-in security add-on for on-premises mailboxes

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
