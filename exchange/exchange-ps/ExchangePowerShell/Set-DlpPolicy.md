# Set-DlpPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
**Note**: This cmdlet has been retired from the cloud-based service. For more information, see [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/exchange-online-etrs-to-stop-supporting-dlp-policies/ba-p/3886713). Use the Set-DlpCompliancePolicy and Set-DlpComplianceRule cmdlets instead.

This cmdlet is functional only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Set-DlpPolicy cmdlet to modify data loss prevention (DLP) policies that are based on transport rules (mail flow rules) in your organization.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-DlpPolicy [-Identity] <DlpPolicyIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-Description <String>]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Mode <RuleMode>]
 [-Name <String>]
 [-State <RuleState>]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-DlpPolicy "Employee Numbers" -State Disabled
```

This example disables the DLP policy named Employee Numbers.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The Identity parameter specifies the DLP policy that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

```yaml
Type: DlpPolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Description

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The Description parameter specifies an optional description for the DLP policy.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Mode

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The Mode parameter specifies the action and notification level of the DLP policy. Valid values for this parameter are:

- Audit: When a message matches the conditions specified by the DLP policy, the actions specified by the policy aren't enforced and no notification emails are sent.
- AuditAndNotify: When a message matches the conditions specified by the DLP policy, the actions specified by the policy aren't enforced, but notification emails are sent.
- Enforce: When a message matches the conditions specified by the DLP policy, the actions specified by the policy are enforced and notification emails are sent.

If the State parameter is set to Disabled, the value of the Mode parameter is irrelevant.

```yaml
Type: RuleMode
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the DLP policy.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -State

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The State parameter enables or disables the DLP policy. Valid input for this parameter is Enabled or Disabled.

```yaml
Type: RuleState
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
