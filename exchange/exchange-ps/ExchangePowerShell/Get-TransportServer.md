# Get-TransportServer

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Get-TransportServer cmdlet to view settings that are associated with the Hub Transport server role or the Edge Transport server role.

**Note**: In Exchange 2013 or later, use the Get-TransportService cmdlet instead. If you have scripts that use Get-TransportServer, update them to use Get-TransportService.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-TransportServer [[-Identity] <TransportServerIdParameter>]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-TransportServer
```

This example provides different results depending on the server role on which it's run. When you run this command on an Edge Transport server, it provides a configuration summary for the local server. Otherwise, it displays a list of all Mailbox servers in your organization.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-TransportServer Mailbox01 | Format-List
```

This example retrieves the detailed transport configuration information for the Transport service on the Mailbox server named Mailbox01.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The Identity parameter specifies the Transport server that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

- Name
- GUID
- Distinguished name (DN)
- ExchangeLegacyDN

```yaml
Type: TransportServerIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
