# Export-JournalRuleCollection

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Export-JournalRuleCollection cmdlet to export the journal rules in your organization to an XML file.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Export-JournalRuleCollection [[-Identity] <RuleIdParameter>]
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-ExportLegacyRules]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You can use the Export-JournalRuleCollection cmdlet to export journal rules in your organization to create a backup copy of your rules.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
$file = Export-JournalRuleCollection

[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes('C:\MyDocs\JournalRules.xml', $file.FileData)
```

This example exports journal rules in a two-step process. In the first step, the Export-JournalRuleCollection cmdlet exports journal rules to the variable $file. In the second step, the Set-Content cmdlet saves the exported data to the XML file JournalRules.xml.

### Example 2
```powershell
$file = Export-JournalRuleCollection -ExportLegacyRules

[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes('C:\MyDocs\LegacyJournalRules.xml', $file.FileData)
```

In Exchange Server 2010, this example exports legacy journal rules that were created in Exchange 2007 to an XML file. The first command uses the ExportLegacyRules switch to export legacy journal rules to the variable named $file. The second step saves the exported data to the XML file named LegacyJournalRules.xml.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The Identity parameter specifies the name of a journal rule.

```yaml
Type: RuleIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExportLegacyRules

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

This parameter is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

The ExportLegacyRules switch specifies whether to export Exchange 2007 journal rules. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
