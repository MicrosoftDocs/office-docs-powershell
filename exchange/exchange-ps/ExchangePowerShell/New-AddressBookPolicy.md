# New-AddressBookPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings might be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the New-AddressBookPolicy cmdlet to create an address book policy. Address book policies define the global address list (GAL), offline address book (OAB), room list, and address lists shown to mailbox users who are assigned the policy.

In Exchange Online, this cmdlet is available only in the Address Lists role, and by default, the role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use this cmdlet, you need to add the Address Lists role to a role group (for example, to the Organization Management role group). For more information, see [Add a role to a role group](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions/role-groups#add-a-role-to-a-role-group).

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
New-AddressBookPolicy [-Name] <String> -AddressLists <AddressListIdParameter[]> -GlobalAddressList <GlobalAddressListIdParameter> -OfflineAddressBook <OfflineAddressBookIdParameter> -RoomList <AddressListIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this article lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you might not have access to some parameters if they aren't included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
New-AddressBookPolicy -Name "All Fabrikam ABP" -AddressLists "\All Fabrikam","\All Fabrikam Mailboxes","\All Fabrikam DLs","\All Fabrikam Contacts" -RoomList "\All Fabrikam-Rooms" -OfflineAddressBook "\Fabrikam-All-OAB" -GlobalAddressList "\All Fabrikam"
```

This example creates an address book policy with the following settings:

- Name: All Fabrikam ABP
- Included address lists: All Fabrikam, All Fabrikam Mailboxes, All Fabrikam DLs, All Fabrikam Contacts
- Included room list: All Fabrikam-Rooms
- Included OAB: Fabrikam-All-OAB
- Included GAL: All Fabrikam

## PARAMETERS

### -Name

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE, Exchange Online

The Name parameter specifies the name of the address book policy.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AddressLists

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE, Exchange Online

The AddressLists parameter specifies the address lists for mailbox users who are assigned this address book policy. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the address list. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

You can find the identify values of address lists by using the Get-AddressList cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: AddressListIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -GlobalAddressList

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE, Exchange Online

The GlobalAddressList parameter specifies the GAL for mailbox users who are assigned this address book policy. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the GAL. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

You can find the identify values of GALs by using the Get-GlobalAddressList cmdlet.

You can specify only one GAL for each address book policy.

```yaml
Type: GlobalAddressListIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OfflineAddressBook

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE, Exchange Online

The OfflineAddressBook parameter specifies the OAB for mailbox users who are assigned this address book policy. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OAB. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

You can find the identify values of OABs by using the Get-OfflineAddressBook cmdlet.

You can specify only one OAB for each address book policy.

```yaml
Type: OfflineAddressBookIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RoomList

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE, Exchange Online

The RoomList parameter specifies an address list that used for location experiences for mailbox users who have this address book policy assigned to them.

- When using location experiences (for example, Room Finder or selecting a conference room when scheduling a meeting), users see only resources that match the [RecipientFilter](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/new-addresslist#-recipientfilter) results from the address list that's specified by this parameter.
- When using experiences that aren't location specific (for example, the To or Cc fields of a calendar event), the address lists specified by the AddressLists parameter in this address book policy are applied. The address list specified by this parameter isn't used.

A valid value for this parameter is one address list. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the address list. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

> [!NOTE]
> There's no automatic association between this parameter and [room list distribution groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/recipients/room-mailboxes#create-a-room-list), which also use a parameter named RoomList in the New-DistributionGroup and Set-DistributionGroup cmdlets. You still need to create room list distribution groups and assign resources as group members. Location experiences are filtered to show only rooms included in the address list that's specified by the RoomList property of the address book policy that's assigned to the user (if any).

```yaml
Type: AddressListIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE, Exchange Online

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE

This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE, Exchange Online

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
