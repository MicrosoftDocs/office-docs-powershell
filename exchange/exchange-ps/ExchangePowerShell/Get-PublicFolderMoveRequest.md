## DESCRIPTION
Public folder move requests are used to move public folders between public folder mailboxes. After the move request is complete, you need to update the hierarchy using the Update-PublicFolderMailbox cmdlet.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this article lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you might not have access to some parameters if they aren't included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-PublicFolderMoveRequest -Identity \PublicFolderMove
```

This example returns the status of an in-progress public folder move request with the identity \\PublicFolderMove, which is the default name assigned to public folder moves.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-PublicFolderMoveRequest -RequestQueue MBD01
```

This example returns the status of in-progress and queued requests that are on the source database MBD01.
