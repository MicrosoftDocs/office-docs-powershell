# Stop-MigrationUser

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is functional only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Stop-MigrationUser cmdlet to stop the migration of a user in an existing migration batch.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Stop-MigrationUser [[-Identity] <MigrationUserIdParameter>]
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Partition <MailboxIdParameter>]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this article lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you might not have access to some parameters if they aren't included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Stop-MigrationUser -Identity laura@contoso.com
```

This example stops the migration of the user laura@contoso.com.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE, Exchange Online

The Identity parameter specifies the email address of the user that's being migrated.

You can also identify the user by the GUID value in the MigrationUser property from the output of the Get-MigrationUser cmdlet. This identification method is useful if you accidentally submitted the same user in multiple batches.

```yaml
Type: MigrationUserIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE, Exchange Online

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE

This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Partition

> Applicable: Exchange Online

This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

```yaml
Type: MailboxIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server SE, Exchange Online

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
