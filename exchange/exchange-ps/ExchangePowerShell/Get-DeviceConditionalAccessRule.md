# Get-DeviceConditionalAccessRule

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is functional only in Security & Compliance PowerShell. For more information, see [Security & Compliance PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/scc-powershell).

Use the Get-DeviceConditionalAccessRule cmdlet to view device conditional access rules in Basic Mobility and Security. These rules were created by using the New-DeviceConditionalAccessRule cmdlet or on the **Basic Mobility and Security** page with option **If a device doesn't meet the requirements above, then...** \> **Block access** selected.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-DeviceConditionalAccessRule [[-Identity] <ComplianceRuleIdParameter>]
 [-CompareToWorkload]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
In PowerShell, a policy in Basic Mobility and Security contains a device policy (a device conditional access policy or a device configuration policy) and an associated device rule (a device conditional access rule or a device configuration rule). For more information about Basic Mobility and Security, see [Overview of Basic Mobility and Security for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/basic-mobility-security/overview).

In device conditional access policies, devices that don't meet the access requirement settings in the policy are prevented from accessing Microsoft 365 resources in supported apps. You specify the policy settings in the associated device conditional access rule. For more information, see [Access control for Microsoft 365 email and documents](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/basic-mobility-security/capabilities#access-control-for-microsoft-365-email-and-documents).

To use this cmdlet in Security & Compliance PowerShell, you need to be assigned permissions. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/mdo-portal-permissions) or [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions).
