## DESCRIPTION
Safe Links is a feature in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that checks links in email messages to see if they lead to malicious web sites. When a user clicks a link in a message, the URL is temporarily rewritten and checked against a list of known, malicious web sites. Safe Links includes the URL trace reporting feature to help determine who has clicked through to a malicious web site.
