# Set-ResourceConfig

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings might be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Set-ResourceConfig cmdlet to create custom resource properties that you can add to room and equipment mailboxes.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-ResourceConfig [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-ResourcePropertySchema <MultiValuedProperty>]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
After you use this cmdlet to create custom resource properties, you use the ResourceCustom parameter on the Set-Mailbox cmdlet to add one or more of those properties to a room or equipment mailbox. For more information, see the ResourceCustom parameter description in Set-Mailbox.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this article lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you might not have access to some parameters if they aren't included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-ResourceConfig -ResourcePropertySchema Room/Whiteboard,Equipment/Van
```

This example adds the custom resource properties Room/Whiteboard and Equipment/Van. These values replace any existing custom resource properties that are already configured.

### Example 2
```powershell
Set-ResourceConfig -ResourcePropertySchema @{Add="Room/TV"; Remove="Equipment/Laptop"}
```

This example adds the custom resource property Room/TV and removes Equipment/Laptop without affecting other custom resource properties that are already configured.

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResourcePropertySchema

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The ResourcePropertySchema parameter specifies the custom resource property that you want to make available to room or equipment mailboxes. This parameter uses the syntax `Room/<Text>` or `Equipment/<Text>` where the `<Text>` value doesn't contain spaces. For example, `Room/Whiteboard` or `Equipment/Van`. You can specify multiple values separated by commas.

To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: `Value1,Value2,...ValueN`. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

To add or remove one or more values without affecting any existing entries, use the following syntax: `@{Add="Value1","Value2"...; Remove="Value3","Value4"...}`.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
