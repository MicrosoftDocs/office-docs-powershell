# Remove-UMCallAnsweringRule

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Remove-UMCallAnsweringRule cmdlet to remove an existing Unified Messaging (UM) call answering rule.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-UMCallAnsweringRule [-Identity] <UMCallAnsweringRuleIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Mailbox <MailboxIdParameter>]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Remove-UMCallAnsweringRule cmdlet removes an existing UM call answering rule that has been created and stored in a UM-enabled user's mailbox. When you remove an existing call answering rule, all of the remaining call answering rules are still processed in order of their priority.

After this task is completed, the cmdlet sets the parameters and the values specified.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-UMCallAnsweringRule -Identity MyUMCallAnsweringRule
```

This example removes the call answering rule MyUMCallAnsweringRule from a user's mailbox. The user's mailbox is the mailbox of the user running the cmdlet.

### Example 2
```powershell
Remove-UMCallAnsweringRule -Identity MyUMCallAnsweringRule -Mailbox tonysmith
```

This example removes the call answering rule MyUMCallAnsweringRule from the mailbox of tonysmith.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

The Identity parameter specifies the identifier for a call answering rule being removed.

```yaml
Type: UMCallAnsweringRuleIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Mailbox

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

The Mailbox parameter specifies the UM-enabled mailbox where the call answering rule is changed. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

- Name
- Alias
- Distinguished name (DN)
- Canonical DN
- Domain\\Username
- Email address
- GUID
- LegacyExchangeDN
- SamAccountName
- User ID or user principal name (UPN)

If you don't use this parameter, the mailbox of the user who is running the command is used.

```yaml
Type: MailboxIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
