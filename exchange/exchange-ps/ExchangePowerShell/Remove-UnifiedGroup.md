# Remove-UnifiedGroup

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Remove-UnifiedGroup cmdlet to remove Microsoft 365 Groups from your cloud-based organization.

**Note**: You can't use this cmdlet to remove Microsoft 365 Groups if you connect using certificate based authentication (also known as CBA or app-only authentication for unattended scripts) or Azure managed identity. You can use Microsoft Graph instead. For more information, see [Delete group](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/group-delete).

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-UnifiedGroup [-Identity] <UnifiedGroupIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-Force]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Microsoft 365 Groups are group objects that are available across Microsoft 365 services.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-UnifiedGroup -Identity "Research Department"
```

This example removes the Microsoft 365 Group named Research Department.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

The Identity parameter specifies the Microsoft 365 Group that you want to remove. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the Microsoft 365 Group. For example:

- Name
- Alias
- Distinguished name (DN)
- Canonical DN
- Email address
- GUID

```yaml
Type: UnifiedGroupIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
