parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CompletePublicFolderMigrationWithDataLoss
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    This cmdlet has a built-in pause, so use `-Confirm:$false` to skip the confirmation.

  defaultValue: None

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MigrationBatchIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the name of the migration batch that you want to complete. The value for this parameter is specified by the Name parameter for the New-MigrationBatch cmdlet. Use the Get-MigrationBatch cmdlet to determine the value of this parameter for the migration batch.

  name: NotificationEmails
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The NotificationEmails parameter specifies one or more email addresses that status reports are sent to after the migration batch is completed. You can specify multiple email addresses separated by commas.

    If you don't use this parameter, the final status report is sent to the administrator who runs the Complete-MigrationBatch cmdlet.

  name: SyncAndComplete
  description: |+
    The SyncAndComplete switch specifies whether to trigger a synchronization immediately followed by a completion of the migration batch if the synchronization was successful. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Complete-MigrationBatch
name: Complete-MigrationBatch
description: |-
  After a migration batch for a local or cross-forest move has successfully run and has a status state of Synced, use the Complete-MigrationBatch cmdlet to finalize the migration batch. Finalization is the last phase performed during a local or cross-forest move. When you finalize a migration batch, the cmdlet does the following for each mailbox in the migration batch:

  - Runs a final incremental synchronization.
  - Configures the user's Microsoft Outlook profile to point to the new target domain.
  - Converts the source mailbox to a mail-enabled user in the source domain.

  In the cloud-based service, this cmdlet sets the value of CompleteAfter to the current time. It is important to remember that any CompleteAfter setting that has been applied to the individual users within the batch will override the setting on the batch, so the completion for some users may be delayed until their configured time.

  When the finalization process is complete, you can remove the batch by using the Remove-MigrationBatch cmdlet.

  If a migration batch has a status of Completed with Errors, you can re-attempt to finalize the failed users. In Exchange Online, use the Start-MigrationBatch cmdlet to retry migration for failed users. In Exchange 2013 or Exchange 2016, use the Complete-MigrationBatch to retry these failed users.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
