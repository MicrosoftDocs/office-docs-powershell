    Set-MailboxDatabase "Mailbox Database01" -DeletedItemRetention 7.00:00:00
  description: |-
    This example sets the length of time that deleted items are retained. If a specific mailbox has its own item retention set, that value is used instead of this value, which is set on the mailbox database.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Set-MailboxDatabase <Mailbox Database Name> -RpcClientAccessServer <ClientAccessServer or ClientAccessServerArrayID>
  description: |-
    In Exchange Server 2010, this example updates a mailbox database so that all client connections for mailboxes on the database come through the Client Access server or Client Access server array. You can also use this command to change the Client Access server or Client Access server array through which the client is connecting to the Mailbox server.

    For more information about RPC access through Client Access servers, see [Set-RpcClientAccess](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-rpcclientaccess) and [Set-ClientAccessArray](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-clientaccessarray).

  name: CalendarLoggingQuota
  description: |+
    The CalendarLoggingQuota parameter specifies the maximum size of the log in the Recoverable Items folder of the mailbox that stores changes to calendar items. When the log exceeds this size, calendar logging is disabled until messaging records management (MRM) removes older calendar logs to free up more space.

    A valid value is a number up to 1.999999999 terabytes (2199023254528 bytes) or the value unlimited. The default value is 6 gigabytes (6442450944 bytes).

    When you enter a value, qualify the value with one of the following units:

    - B (bytes)
    - KB (kilobytes)
    - MB (megabytes)
    - GB (gigabytes)
    - TB (terabytes)

    Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte.

    The value of this parameter must be less than or equal to the value of the RecoverableItemsQuota parameter.

    This setting applies to all mailboxes in the database that don't have their own calendar logging quota configured.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DataMoveReplicationConstraint
  description: |+
    The DataMoveReplicationConstraint parameter specifies the throttling behavior for high availability mailbox moves. Valid values are:

    - None: Moves shouldn't be throttled to ensure high availability. Use this setting if the database isn't part of a database availability group (DAG).
    - AllCopies (Exchange 2013 or earlier): If the database is replicated, all passive mailbox database copies must have the most recent changes synchronized.
    - AllDatacenters (Exchange 2013 or earlier): If the database is replicated to multiple Active Directory sites, at least one passive mailbox database copy in each site must have the most recent changes replicated.
    - CINoReplication (Exchange 2013 or later): Moves shouldn't be throttled to ensure high availability, but the content indexing service must be up to date.
    - CISecondCopy (Exchange 2013 or later): At least one passive mailbox database copy must have the most recent changes synchronized, and the content indexing service must be up to date. Use this setting to indicate that the database is replicated to one or more mailbox database copies.
    - CISecondDatacenter (Exchange 2013 or later): At least one passive mailbox database copy in another Active Directory site must have the most recent changes replicated, and the content indexing service must be up to date. Use this setting to indicate that the database is replicated to database copies in multiple Active Directory sites.
    - SecondCopy: At least one passive mailbox database copy must have the most recent changes synchronized. This is the default value. Use this setting to indicate that the database is replicated to one or more mailbox database copies.
    - SecondDatacenter: At least one passive mailbox database copy in another Active Directory site must have the most recent changes replicated. Use this setting to indicate that the database is replicated to database copies in multiple Active Directory sites.

    Any value other than None enables the Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Replication service to coordinate with Active Manager. For more information, see [Active Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/high-availability/database-availability-groups/active-manager).

  name: ProhibitSendQuota
  description: |+
    The ProhibitSendQuota parameter specifies a size limit for the mailbox. If the mailbox reaches or exceeds this size, the mailbox can't send new messages, and the user receives a descriptive warning message.

    A valid value is a number up to 1.999999999 terabytes (2199023254528 bytes) or the value unlimited. When you enter a number, you can qualify it with one of the following units:

    - B (bytes)
    - KB (kilobytes)
    - MB (megabytes)
    - GB (gigabytes)
    - TB (terabytes)

    Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte.

    The ProhibitSendQuota value must be less than or equal to the ProhibitSendReceiveQuota value.

    This settings applies to all mailboxes in the database that don't have their own prohibit send quota configured. The default value is 2 gigabytes (2147483648 bytes).

  name: ProhibitSendReceiveQuota
  description: |+
    The ProhibitSendReceiveQuota parameter specifies a size limit for the mailbox. If the mailbox reaches or exceeds this size, the mailbox can't send or receive new messages. Messages sent to the mailbox are returned to the sender with a descriptive error message. This value effectively determines the maximum size of the mailbox.

    A valid value is a number up to 1.999999999 terabytes (2199023254528 bytes) or the value unlimited. When you enter a number, you can qualify it with one of the following units:

    - B (bytes)
    - KB (kilobytes)
    - MB (megabytes)
    - GB (gigabytes)
    - TB (terabytes)

    Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte.

    The value must be greater than or equal to the ProhibitSendQuota or IssueWarningQuota values.

    This setting applies to all mailboxes in the database that don't have their own prohibit send receive quota configured. The default value is 2.99804 gigabytes (2469396480 bytes)

  name: PublicFolderDatabase
  description: |+
    This parameter is functional only in Exchange Server 2010.

    The PublicFolderDatabase parameter specifies the associated public folder database for this mailbox database. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the public folder database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None

  name: QuotaNotificationSchedule
  description: |+
    This parameter is functional only in Exchange Server 2010.

    The QuotaNotificationSchedule parameter specifies when quota messages are sent to mailboxes that have reached one of the quota values.

    The syntax for this parameter is: `StartDay.Hour:Minute [AM | PM]-EndDay.Hour:Minute [AM | PM]`.

    You can use the following values for days:

    - Full name of the day.
    - Abbreviated name of the day.
    - Integer from 0 through 6, where 0 = Sunday.

    You can enter the time in 24 hour format and omit the AM/PM value. If you enter the time in 12 time hour format, include a space between the time and the AM/PM value.

    You can mix and match date/time formats.

    The start time and end time must be at least 15 minutes apart. Minutes are rounded down to 0, 15, 30, or 45.

    Here are some examples:

    - "Sun.11:30 PM-Mon.1:30 AM"
    - "6.22:00-6.22:15" (Run from Saturday at 10:00 PM until Saturday at 10:15 PM.)

  name: RecoverableItemsQuota
  description: |+
    The RecoverableItemsQuota parameter specifies the maximum size for the Recoverable Items folder of the mailbox. If the Recoverable Items folder reaches or exceeds this size, it no longer accepts messages.

    A valid value is a number up to 1.999999999 terabytes (2199023254528 bytes) or the value unlimited. The default value is 30 gigabytes (32212254720 bytes).

    When you enter a number, you can qualify it with one of the following units:

    - B (bytes)
    - KB (kilobytes)
    - MB (megabytes)
    - GB (gigabytes)
    - TB (terabytes)

    Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte.

    The RecoverableItemsQuota value must be greater than or equal to the RecoverableItemsWarningQuota value.

    This settings applies to all mailboxes in the database that don't have their own Recoverable Items quota configured.

  name: RecoverableItemsWarningQuota
  description: |+
    The RecoverableItemsWarningQuota parameter specifies the warning threshold for the size of the Recoverable Items folder for the mailbox. If the Recoverable Items folder reaches or exceeds this size, Exchange logs an event to the application event log.

    A valid value is a number up to 1.999999999 terabytes (2199023254528 bytes) or the value unlimited. The default value is 20 gigabytes (21474836480 bytes).

  name: RetainDeletedItemsUntilBackup
  description: |+
    The RetainDeletedItemsUntilBackup parameter specifies whether to keep items in the Recoverable Items\\Deletions folder of the mailbox until the next database backup occurs. Valid values are:

    - $true: Deleted items in mailboxes are kept until the next mailbox database backup. This value could effectively override the deleted DeletedItemRetention and RecoverableItemsQuota parameter values.
    - $false: This is the default value. Retention of deleted items in mailboxes is controlled by the DeletedItemRetention and RecoverableItemsQuota parameters.

    This settings applies to all mailboxes in the database that don't have their own RetainDeletedItemsUntilBackup value configured.

    For more information, see [Recoverable Items folder in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/recoverable-items-folder/recoverable-items-folder).

    **Note**: If you set the value of this parameter to $true when the value of the UseDatabaseRetentionDefaults parameter on a specific mailbox is also $true (the default value), the value of the UseDatabaseRetentionDefaults property in the output of the Get-Mailbox cmdlet will erroneously appear as False. To verify the value of the UseDatabaseRetentionDefaults property on the mailbox, do the following steps in the Exchange Management Shell:

    - Run the following command: `Import-Module ActiveDirectory`.
    - Replace \<Alias\> with the Alias value of the mailbox, and run the following command: `Get-ADUser <Alias> -Properties mDBUseDefaults | Format-List mDBUseDefaults`.

    This parameter is functional only in Exchange Server 2010.

    The RpcClientAccessServer parameter specifies the Client Access server or Client Access server array through which RPC clients (for example, Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 clients) access their mailboxes. This feature is supported for all versions of Outlook.

    When connecting with Outlook 2003 clients, RPC encryption is disabled by default. Unless RPC encryption is enabled on Outlook 2003 or disabled on the server, Outlook 2003 clients won't be able to connect. For more information, see [Understanding RPC Client Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2010/ee332317(v=exchg.141)).
