### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This cmdlet has been deprecated. If you use AD RMS with Exchange Online, you need to migrate to Azure Information Protection before you can use message encryption. For more information, see [Verify that Azure Rights Management is active](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/set-up-new-message-encryption-capabilities#verify-that-azure-rights-management-is-active).

  Use the Set-RMSTemplate cmdlet to modify the properties of an existing Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) template in your organization.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  code: |-
    Set-RMSTemplate "Contoso Confidential" -Type Archived
  description: |-
    This example changes the RMS template Contoso Confidential from Distributed to Archived. This prevents future use of Contoso Confidential for encryption, but allows access to existing content that's rights-protected by Contoso Confidential.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    The Identity parameter specifies the RMS template. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the RMS template, for example:
