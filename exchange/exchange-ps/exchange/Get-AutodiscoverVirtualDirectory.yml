parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ADPropertiesOnly
  description: |+
    The ADPropertiesOnly switch specifies whether to return only the virtual directory properties that are stored in Active Directory. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you don't use this switch, the properties in Active Directory and in the Internet Information Services (IIS) metabase are returned.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The Identity parameter specifies the Autodiscover virtual directory that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the virtual directory. For example:

    - Name or Server\\Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    The Name value uses the syntax `"VirtualDirectoryName (WebsiteName)"` from the properties of the virtual directory. You can specify the wildcard character (\*) instead of the default website by using the syntax `VirtualDirectoryName*`.

    You can't use the Identity and Server parameters in the same command.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - ExchangeLegacyDN

  name: ShowMailboxVirtualDirectories
  description: |+
    The ShowMailboxVirtualDirectories switch shows information about backend virtual directories on Mailbox servers. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    By default, this cmdlet shows information about virtual directories in the Client Access services on Mailbox servers. Client connections are proxied from the Client Access services on Mailbox servers to the backend services on Mailbox servers. Clients don't connect directly to the backend services.

    We recommend that you use this parameter only under the direction of Microsoft Customer Service and Support.
