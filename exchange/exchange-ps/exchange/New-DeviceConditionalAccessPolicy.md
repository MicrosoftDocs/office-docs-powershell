# New-DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in Security & Compliance PowerShell. For more information, see [Security & Compliance PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/scc-powershell).

Use the New-DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy cmdlet to create mobile device conditional access policies in Basic Mobility and Security in Microsoft 365.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
New-DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy [-Name] <String>
 [-Comment <String>]
 [-Confirm]
 [-Enabled <Boolean>]
 [-Force]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The cmdlets in Basic Mobility and Security are described in the following list:

- DeviceTenantPolicy and DeviceTenantRule cmdlets: A policy that defines whether to block or allow mobile device access to Exchange Online email by unsupported devices that use Exchange ActiveSync only. This setting applies to all users in your organization. Both allow and block scenarios allow reporting for unsupported devices, and you can specify exceptions to the policy based on security groups.
- DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy and DeviceConditionalAccessRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device access to Microsoft 365 for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups. Unsupported devices are not allowed to enroll in Basic Mobility and Security.
- DeviceConfigurationPolicy and DeviceConfigurationRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device settings for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups.
- Get-DevicePolicy: Returns all Basic Mobility and Security policies regardless of type (DeviceTenantPolicy, DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy or DeviceConfigurationPolicy).

For more information about Basic Mobility and Security, see [Overview of Basic Mobility and Security for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/basic-mobility-security/overview).

To use this cmdlet in Security & Compliance PowerShell, you need to be assigned permissions. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mdo-portal-permissions) or [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
New-DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy -Identity "Human Resources"
```

This example creates a new mobile device conditional access policy named Human Resources

## PARAMETERS

### -Name
The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the policy. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in double quotation marks.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Comment
The Comment parameter specifies an optional comment. If you specify a value that contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example: "This is an admin note".

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Enabled
The Enabled parameter specifies whether the policy is enabled. Valid values are:

- $true: The policy is enabled. This is the default value.
- $false: The policy is disabled.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch doesn't work in Security & Compliance PowerShell.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
