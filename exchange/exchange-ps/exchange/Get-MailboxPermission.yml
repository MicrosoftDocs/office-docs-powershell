### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Get-MailboxPermission cmdlet to retrieve permissions on a mailbox.

  **Note**: In Exchange Online PowerShell, we recommend that you use the Get-EXOMailboxPermission cmdlet instead of this cmdlet. For more information, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReadFromDomainController
  description: |+
    The ReadFromDomainController switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    The command: `Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true` to include all objects in the forest requires the ReadFromDomainController switch. Otherwise, the command might use a global catalog that contains outdated information. Also, you might need to run multiple iterations of the command with the ReadFromDomainController switch to get the information.

    By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.

  name: User
  description: |+
    The User parameter filters the results by who has permissions to the mailbox that's specified by the Identity parameter. You can specify the following types of users or groups (security principals) for this parameter:

    - Mailbox users
    - Mail users
    - Security groups

    For the best results, we recommend using the following values:

    - UPN: For example, `user@contoso.com` (users only).
    - Domain\\SamAccountName: For example, `contoso\user`.

    Otherwise, you can use any value that uniquely identifies the user or group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    You can't use this parameter with the Owner switch.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Get-MailboxPermission
name: Get-MailboxPermission
description: |-
  The output of this cmdlet shows the following information:

  - Identity: The mailbox in question.
  - User: The security principal (user, security group, Exchange management role group, etc.) that has permission to the mailbox.
  - AccessRights: The permission that the security principal has on the mailbox. The available values are ChangeOwner (change the owner of the mailbox), ChangePermission (change the permissions on the mailbox), DeleteItem (delete the mailbox), ExternalAccount (indicates the account isn't in the same domain), FullAccess (open the mailbox, access its contents, but can't send mail) and ReadPermission (read the permissions on the mailbox). Whether the permissions are allowed or denied is indicated in the Deny column.
  - IsInherited: Whether the permission is inherited (True) or directly assigned to the mailbox (False). Permissions are inherited from the mailbox database and/or Active Directory. Typically, directly assigned permissions override inherited permissions.
  - Deny: Whether the permission is allowed (False) or denied (True). Typically, deny permissions override allow permissions.

  By default, the following permissions are assigned to user mailboxes:

  - FullAccess and ReadPermission are directly assigned to NT AUTHORITY\\SELF. This entry gives a user permission to their own mailbox.
  - FullAccess is denied to Administrator, Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins and Organization Management. These inherited permissions prevent these users and group members from opening other users' mailboxes.
  - ChangeOwner, ChangePermission, DeleteItem, and ReadPermission are allowed for Administrator, Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins and Organization Management. Note that these inherited permission entries also appear to allow FullAccess. However, these users and groups do not have FullAccess to the mailbox because the inherited Deny permission entries override the inherited Allow permission entries.
  - FullAccess is inherited by NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM and ReadPermission is inherited by NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK.
  - FullAccess and ReadPermission are inherited by Exchange Servers, ChangeOwner, ChangePermission, DeleteItem, and ReadPermission are inherited by Exchange Trusted Subsystem and ReadPermission is inherited by Managed Availability Servers.

  By default, other security groups and role groups inherit permissions to mailboxes based on their location (on-premises Exchange or Microsoft 365).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
