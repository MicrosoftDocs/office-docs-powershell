### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Update-SiteMailbox cmdlet to trigger a Microsoft SharePoint synchronization. This command synchronizes document content membership and permissions into Microsoft Exchange. You may need to perform this action when troubleshooting document or membership synchronization issues.

  Site mailboxes were deprecated in Exchange Online and SharePoint Online in 2017. For more information, see [Deprecation of Site Mailboxes](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/deprecation-of-site-mailboxes/ba-p/93028).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

examples:

  code: |-
    Update-SiteMailbox -BypassOwnerCheck -Identity "MarketingEvents 2013"
  description: |-
    This example updates the site mailbox MarketingEvents 2013. If you don't specify the target, this triggers both document and membership synchronization. Because the BypassOwnerCheck parameter is used, it isn't necessary to be an owner or member of the site mailbox to run this cmdlet.

- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Update-SiteMailbox -BypassOwnerCheck -Identity WinterHoliday@tailspintoys.com -FullSync
  description: |-
    This example updates the site mailbox WinterHoliday@tailspintoys.com and performs a full synchronization. By default, the update only occurs for synchronization from the last synchronization. This is only applicable to document synchronization

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BypassOwnerCheck
  description: |+
    The BypassOwnerCheck parameter is used when the account that's running the command isn't a member or owner of the site mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you don't use this switch, and you aren't a member or owner of the site mailbox, the command will fail.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019

  name: FullSync
  description: |+
    The FullSync switch specifies full sync is expensive and will have a performance impact on the Exchange system. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
