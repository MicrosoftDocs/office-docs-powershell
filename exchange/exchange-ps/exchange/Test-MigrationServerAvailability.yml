### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Test-MigrationServerAvailability cmdlet to test the availability of the target server in preparation to perform cross-forest mailbox moves, migration of on-premises mailboxes to Exchange Online, or to migrate on-premises mailbox data from an IMAP server to Exchange Online mailboxes. For all migration types, the cmdlet attempts to verify the connection settings used to connect to the target server.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AcceptUntrustedCertificates

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="AuthenticationMethod" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Authentication
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The Authentication parameter specifies the authentication method used by the on-premises mail server. Use Basic or NTLM. If you don't include this parameter, Basic authentication is used.

    The parameter is only used for cutover Exchange migrations and staged Exchange migrations.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Autodiscover
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Autodiscover switch specifies that the command should use the Autodiscover service to obtain the connection settings for the target server. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  description: |+
    The Credentials parameter specifies the username and password for an account that can access mailboxes on the target server. Specify the username in the domain\\username format or the user principal name (UPN) (user@example.com) format.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter.

  The Test-MigrationServerAvailability cmdlet verifies that you can communicate with the on-premises mail server that houses the mailbox data that you want to migrate to cloud-based mailboxes. When you run this cmdlet, you must specify the migration type. You can specify whether to communicate with an IMAP server or with an Exchange server.

  For an IMAP migration, this cmdlet uses the server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and a port number to verify the connection. If the verification is successful, use the same connection settings when you create a migration request with the New-MigrationBatch cmdlet.

  For an Exchange migration, this cmdlet uses one of the following settings to communicate with the on-premises server:

  - For Exchange 2003, it uses the server's FQDN and credentials for an administrator account that can access the server.
  - For Exchange Server 2007 and later versions, you can connect using the Autodiscover service and the email address of an administrator account that can access the server.

  If the verification is successful, you can use the same settings to create a migration endpoint. For more information, see:

  - New-MigrationEndpoint
  - New-MigrationBatch

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
