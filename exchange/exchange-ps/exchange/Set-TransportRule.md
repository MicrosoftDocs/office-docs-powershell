# Set-TransportRule

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Set-TransportRule cmdlet to modify existing transport rules (mail flow rules) in your organization.

If you delete all conditions and exceptions from a rule, the rule action is applied to all messages. This can have unintended consequences. For example, if the rule action is to delete the message, removing the conditions and exceptions could cause the rule to delete all inbound and outbound messages for the entire organization.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## DESCRIPTION
In on-premises Exchange organizations, rules created on Mailbox servers are stored in Active Directory. All Mailbox servers in the organization have access to the same set of rules. On Edge Transport servers, rules are saved in the local copy of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS). Rules aren't shared or replicated between Edge Transport servers or between Mailbox servers and Edge Transport servers. Also, some conditions and actions are exclusive to each server role.

The search for words or text patterns in the subject or other header fields in the message occurs after the message has been decoded from the MIME content transfer encoding method that was used to transmit the binary message between SMTP servers in ASCII text. You can't use conditions or exceptions to search for the raw (typically, Base64) encoded values of the subject or other header fields in messages.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-TransportRule "Sales Team Disclaimer" -FromMemberOf "Sales Department"
```

This example modifies the existing rule named Sales Team Disclaimer transport rule by adding the condition that the sender of the message is a member of the Sales Department group.

This example sets the FromMemberOf parameter to a value of Sales-Group, which specifies that the rule is applied if the sender of the message is a member of the Sales-Group distribution group.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the rule that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the rule. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

```yaml
Type: RuleIdParameter

- Name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- Email address

- GUID

To enter multiple values, use the following syntax: \<value1\>,\<value2\>,...\<valueX\>. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: "\<value1\>","\<value2\>",..."\<valueX\>".

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)

The ApplyHtmlDisclaimerFallbackAction parameter specifies what to do if the HTML disclaimer can't be added to a message. Valid values are:

- Wrap: The original message is wrapped in a new message envelope, and the disclaimer is used as the message body for the new message. This is the default value. Subsequent mail flow rules are applied to the new message envelope, not to the original message. Therefore, configure a rule with this action at a lower priority (a higher priority number) than other rules. If the original message can't be wrapped in a new message envelope, the original message isn't delivered. The message is returned to the sender in an non-delivery report (also known as an NDR or bounce message).

- Ignore: The rule is ignored and the message is delivered without the disclaimer.

- Reject: The message is rejected.

If you don't use this parameter with the ApplyHtmlDisclaimerText parameter, the default value Wrap is used.

```yaml
Type: DisclaimerFallbackAction
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ApplyHtmlDisclaimerLocation
This parameter specifies an action or part of an action for the rule.

In on-premises Exchange, this action is only available on Mailbox servers.

The ApplyHtmlDisclaimerLocation parameter specifies where to insert the HTML disclaimer text in the body of messages. Valid values are:

- Append: The disclaimer is added to the end of the message body. This is the default value.

- Prepend: The disclaimer is inserted to the beginning of the message body.

If you don't use this parameter with the ApplyHtmlDisclaimerText parameter, the default value Append is used.

```yaml
Type: DisclaimerLocation
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

### -ApplyHtmlDisclaimerText
This parameter specifies an action or part of an action for the rule.

In on-premises Exchange, this action is only available on Mailbox servers.

The ApplyHtmlDisclaimerText parameter specifies an action that adds the disclaimer text to messages. Disclaimer text can include HTML tags and inline cascading style sheet (CSS) tags. You can add images using the IMG tag.

You use the ApplyHtmlDisclaimerLocation parameter to specify where to insert the text in the message body (the default value is Append), and the ApplyHtmlDisclaimerFallbackAction parameter to specify what to do if the disclaimer can't be added to the message (the default value is Wrap).

```yaml
Type: DisclaimerText
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

- Valid priority values for a new rule (the 9th rule) are from 0 through 8.

- The default value for a new rule (the 9th rule) is 8.

If you modify the priority value of a rule, the position of the rule in the list changes to match the priority value you specify. In other words, if you set the priority value of a rule to the same value as an existing rule, the priority value of the existing rule and all other lower priority rules after it is increased by 1.
