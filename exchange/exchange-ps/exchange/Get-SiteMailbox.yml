### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Get-SiteMailbox cmdlet to view information about site mailboxes. This cmdlet is primarily used by Microsoft SharePoint and Exchange to display information to users in the user interface. However, you may find it helpful for discovering information such as the site mailbox's owners, members, and lifecycle status.

  Site mailboxes were deprecated in Exchange Online and SharePoint Online in 2017. For more information, see [Deprecation of Site Mailboxes](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/deprecation-of-site-mailboxes/ba-p/93028).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Anr
  description: |+
    The Anr parameter specifies a string on which to perform an ambiguous name resolution (ANR) search. You can specify a partial string and search for objects with an attribute that matches that string. The default attributes searched are:

    - CommonName (CN)
    - DisplayName
    - FirstName
    - LastName
    - Alias

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BypassOwnerCheck
  description: |+
    The BypassOwnerCheck parameter is used when the account that's running the command isn't a member or owner of the site mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you don't use this switch, and you aren't a member or owner of the site mailbox, the command will fail.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DeletedSiteMailbox
  description: |+
    The DeletedSiteMailbox switch returns site mailboxes that have been marked for pending deletion. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    When the lifecycle application in SharePoint closes a site mailbox, the site mailbox is retained for the period specified in the lifecycle policy in the closed state. The mailbox can then be reactivated by an end user or by a SharePoint administrator. After the retention period, the Exchange site mailbox that's housed in the mailbox database will have its name prepended with MDEL: to indicate that it has been marked for deletion. To free storage space and the alias, use the Remove-Mailbox cmdlet to manually remove these site mailboxes from the mailbox database.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RecipientIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the identity of the site mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReadFromDomainController
  description: |+
    The ReadFromDomainController switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    The command: `Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true` to include all objects in the forest requires the ReadFromDomainController switch. Otherwise, the command might use a global catalog that contains outdated information. Also, you might need to run multiple iterations of the command with the ReadFromDomainController switch to get the information.

    By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Unlimited" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ResultSize
  description: |+
    The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
applicable:
- Exchange Server 2013
- Exchange Server 2016
- Exchange Server 2019
uid: ExchangePowerShell.Get-SiteMailbox
name: Get-SiteMailbox
description: |-
  If you aren't a member or owner of the site mailbox that you want to view the diagnostics information for, you must use the BypassOwnerCheck parameter when running this cmdlet. If you aren't a member or owner of the site mailbox and you run this cmdlet without using the BypassOwnerCheck parameter, the command fails with an "object not found" error.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet.
