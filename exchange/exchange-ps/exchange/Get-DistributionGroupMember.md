# Get-DistributionGroupMember

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-DistributionGroupMember cmdlet to view the members of distribution groups and mail-enabled security groups.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-DistributionGroupMember [-Identity] <DistributionGroupMemberIdParameter> [-Credential <PSCredential>]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-IgnoreDefaultScope] [-ReadFromDomainController] [-ResultSize <Unlimited>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
If your organization has multiple Active Directory domains, you may need to run the Set-ADServerSettings cmdlet with the ViewEntireForest parameter set to $true before running the Get-DistributionGroupMember cmdlet to view the entire forest. For more information, see Example 2.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-DistributionGroupMember -Identity "Marketing USA"
```

This example returns the existing distribution group members for the distribution group named Marketing USA.

### Example 2
```powershell
Set-ADServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true; Get-DistributionGroupMember -Identity "Marketing Worldwide"
```

This example sets the scope of the search to the entire forest by running the Set-ADServerSettings cmdlet, then the Get-DistributionGroupMember cmdlet searches the entire forest for the distribution group members in the Marketing Worldwide distribution group.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the distribution group or mail-enabled security group. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

- Name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- Email address

- GUID

```yaml
Type: DistributionGroupMemberIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.

A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IgnoreDefaultScope
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope.

Using the IgnoreDefaultScope switch introduces the following restrictions:

- You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.

- You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ReadFromDomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The ReadFromDomainController switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you run the command Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true to include all objects in the forest and you don't use the ReadFromDomainController switch, it's possible that information will be read from a global catalog that has outdated information. When you use the ReadFromDomainController switch, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information. You don't have to specify a value with this switch.

By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResultSize
The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
