### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Stop-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup cmdlet to mark a member of a database availability group (DAG) as failed, or to mark all DAG members in a specific Active Directory site as failed.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="AdSiteIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ActiveDirectorySite
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The ActiveDirectorySite parameter specifies the Active Directory site containing the DAG members to stop (for example, stop all DAG members in a particular Active Directory site).

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ConfigurationOnly
  description: |+
    The ConfigurationOnly switch updates the Active Directory properties with the stop action, but doesn't perform a stop of the DAG or any members. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You eed to use this switch when the DAG member servers are offline, but Active Directory is up and accessible in the primary datacenter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseAvailabilityGroupIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the name of the DAG being stopped.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MailboxServer
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The MailboxServer parameter specifies a single DAG member to stop. If Datacenter Activation Coordination mode is enabled for the DAG and all DAG members are in the same Active Directory site, use the MailboxServer parameter to stop individual DAG members instead of the ActiveDirectorySite parameter when stopping failed DAG members.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None

description: |-
  The Stop-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup cmdlet is used during a datacenter switchover. This cmdlet is used to mark one or members of the DAG as failed (also known as stopped).The Stop-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup cmdlet can be run against a DAG only when the DAG is configured with a DatacenterActivationMode value of DagOnly.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you.
