examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    New-RetentionPolicy "Business General"
  description: |-
    This example creates the retention policy Business General without associating any retention policy tags.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    New-RetentionPolicy "Business General" -RetentionPolicyTagLinks "General Business","Legal"
  description: |-
    This example creates the retention policy Business General and uses the RetentionPolicyTagLinks parameter to associate two retention policy tags with this policy. You can enter multiple retention policy tags, separated by commas. If a tag name includes a space, enclose the name in quotation marks.

    The second retention tag, which is named Legal, is also enclosed in quotation marks for consistency. Values that don't include a space can be enclosed in quotation marks without any change to how the command is interpreted.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IsDefault
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The IsDefault switch specifies that this retention policy is the default retention policy. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    When you use this switch, you'll get a warning that this retention policy will replace the current default retention policy (the policy where the IsDefault property value is currently True) as the default. By default, the default retention policy is named Default MRM Policy.

    **Note**: Changing which retention policy is the default might or might not affect new and existing mailboxes based on the value of the RetentionPolicy parameter on all mailbox plans:

    - $null (blank): Changes to which retention policy is the default are continually reflected in new and existing mailboxes.
    - A retention policy is specified: The value of the RetentionPolicy parameter for all mailbox plans should be $null (blank) or match the Exchange retention policy that's configured as default policy for the organization. Otherwise, the experience might be inconsistent when creating new mailboxes, enabling disabled mailboxes, and changing licenses. For more information see [Mailbox plans in Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-user-mailboxes/mailbox-plans).

    If a mailbox is assigned an Exchange retention policy that's not the default policy, the RetentionPolicy value of the mailbox will be overwritten when changing licenses and will need to be manually reset to the original value.

    Changes to the default retention policy that affect existing mailboxes can potentially saturate the network if there are hundreds or thousands of mailboxes that require updates.

  defaultValue: None

  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IsDefaultArbitrationMailbox
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The IsDefaultArbitrationMailbox switch configures this policy as the default retention policy for arbitration mailboxes in your Exchange Online organization. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RetentionId
  description: |+
    The RetentionId parameter specifies the identity of the retention policy to ensure mailboxes moved from an on-premises Exchange deployment to the cloud continue to have the same retention policy applied to them. The RetentionId parameter is used in cross-premises deployments. You don't need to specify this parameter in on-premises-only deployments.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  name: RetentionPolicyTagLinks
  description: |+
    The RetentionPolicyTagLinks parameter specifies the names of retention policy tags to be associated with this policy.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
