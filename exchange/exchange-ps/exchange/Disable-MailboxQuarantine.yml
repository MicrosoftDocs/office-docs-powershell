  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    This cmdlet has a built-in pause, so use `-Confirm:$false` to skip the confirmation.

description: |-
  Mailboxes are quarantined when they affect the availability of the mailbox database. Typically a software fix from Microsoft is required before releasing a mailbox from quarantine. If a fix isn't deployed before releasing the mailbox, the quarantine on the mailbox will be re-enabled if the condition recurs. The default quarantine duration is 24 hours.
