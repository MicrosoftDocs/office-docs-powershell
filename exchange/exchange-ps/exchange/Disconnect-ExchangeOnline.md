# Disconnect-ExchangeOnline

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module. For more information, see [Use the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2).

Use the Disconnect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet in the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module to disconnect from an Exchange Online organization.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Disconnect-ExchangeOnline [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Connect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet establishes a connection to the Exchage Online organization of the logged-in admin user. This cmdlet is the counterpart to Connect-ExchangeOnline.

Disconnect-ExchangeOnline closes any active session and clears cache. After a successful disconnect, you can't run any of the V2 cmdlets or older remote PowerShell cmdlets.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Disconnect-ExchangeOnline
```
This example asks for confirmation before disconnecting the current PowerShell session with Exchange Online.


### Example 2
```powershell
Disconnect-ExchangeOnline -Confirm:$false
```
This example disconnects the current PowerShell session with Exchange Online silently and without a confirmation prompt.


## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
