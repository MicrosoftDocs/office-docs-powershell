  code: |-
    Enable-TransportRule -Identity "Require approval of messages to contoso.com" -Mode Audit

    This example enables the transport rule named "Require approval of messages to contoso.com" in audit mode, so you can see how the rule would function by analyzing the related entries in the message tracking log.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RuleIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the rule that you want to enable. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the rule. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RuleMode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Mode
  description: |+
    The Mode parameter specifies how the rule operates after it's enabled. Valid values are:

    - Audit: The actions that the rule would have taken are written to the message tracking log, but no any action is taken on the message that would impact delivery.
    - AuditAndNotify: The rule operates the same as in Audit mode, but notifications are also enabled.
    - Enforce: All actions specified in the rule are taken.

    The value that has already been set in the rule will be persevered, unless -Mode parameter is specified.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019

  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
