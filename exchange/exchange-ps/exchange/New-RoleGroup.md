## DESCRIPTION
You don't have to add members or assign management roles to the role group when you create it. However, until you add members or assign roles to the role group, the role group grants no permissions to users. You can also specify custom configuration or recipient scopes when you create a role group. These scopes are applied to the management role assignments created when the role group is created.

When you create a role group, you can create the group and add members to it directly, or you can create a linked role group. A linked role group links the role group to a universal security group (USG) in another forest. Creating a linked role group is useful if your servers running Exchange reside in a resource forest and your users and administrators reside in a separate user forest. If you create a linked role group, you can't add members directly to it. You must add the members to the USG in the foreign forest.

For more information about role groups, see [Understanding management role groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/understanding-management-role-groups-exchange-2013-help).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
New-RoleGroup -Name "Limited Recipient Management" -Roles "Mail Recipients", "Mail Enabled Public Folders" -Members Kim, Martin
```

This example creates a role group. The Mail Recipients and Mail Enabled Public Folders roles are assigned to the role group, and the users Kim and Martin are added as members. Because no scopes were provided, Kim and Martin can manage any recipient and reset passwords for any users in the organization.

### Example 2
```powershell
New-RoleGroup -Name "Seattle Limited Recipient Management" -Roles "Mail Recipients", "Mail Enabled Public Folders" -Members John, Carol -CustomRecipientWriteScope "Seattle Recipients"
```

This example creates a role group with a custom recipient scope. The custom recipient scope, Seattle Recipients, limits the scope of the roles assigned to the role group to recipients who have their City property set to Seattle. The Mail Recipients and Mail Enabled Public Folders roles are assigned to the role group, and the users John and Carol are added as members.

### Example 3
```powershell
New-RoleGroup -Name "Transport Rules Management" -Roles "Transport Rules" -Members "Compliance Group" -ManagedBy Isabel
```

This example creates a role group and enables Isabel to add or remove members to or from the role group by adding her to the ManagedBy property. The Transport Rules role is assigned to the role group, and the Compliance Group USG is added as a member.

### Example 4
```powershell
$Credentials = Get-Credential; New-RoleGroup -Name "ContosoUsers: Toronto Recipient Admins" -LinkedDomainController dc02.contosousers.contoso.com -LinkedCredential $Credentials -LinkedForeignGroup "Toronto Administrators" -CustomRecipientWriteScope "Toronto Recipients" -Roles "Mail Recipients"
```

This example creates a linked role group that enables the members of the Toronto Administrators USG in the Contoso user forest to manage recipients located in the Toronto office. The custom recipient scope, Toronto Recipients, limits the scope of the roles assigned to the role group to recipients who have their City property set to Toronto. The Mail Recipients role is assigned to the role group.

The first command retrieves the credentials using the Get-Credential cmdlet and stores them in the $Credentials variable. Then the linked role group is created using the second command.

### Example 5
```powershell
$RoleGroup = Get-RoleGroup "Recipient Management"; New-RoleGroup "Limited Recipient Management" -Roles $RoleGroup.Roles
```

This example takes an existing role group and copies the roles from that role group into a new custom role group. This can be useful if you want to create a role group similar to an existing role group but don't want to manually create all the role assignments. For example, you might want to create a role group that has most, but not all, of the management roles assigned to the Recipient Management role group.

The first command stores the existing role group in a variable, and the second command creates the custom role group.

This example uses variables to store information. For more information about variables, see [About Variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_variables).

### Example 6
```powershell
Remove-ManagementRoleAssignment "Distribution Groups-Limited Recipient Management"
```

This example removes the role assignment between the Distribution Groups management role and the Limited Recipient Management role group that you created in the previous example.

## PARAMETERS

### -LinkedDomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The LinkedDomainController parameter specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address of the domain controller in the forest where the foreign USG resides. The domain controller you specify is used to get security information for the foreign USG specified by the LinkedForeignGroup parameter.

If you use the LinkedDomainController parameter, you must specify a foreign USG with the LinkedForeignGroup parameter and you can't use the Members parameter.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: CrossForest
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LinkedForeignGroup
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The LinkedForeignGroup parameter specifies the name of the foreign USG you want to link this role group to. If the foreign USG name contains spaces, enclose the name in quotation marks (").

If you use the LinkedForeignGroup parameter, you must specify a domain controller in the LinkedDomainController parameter and you can't use the Members parameter.

```yaml
Type: UniversalSecurityGroupIdParameter
Parameter Sets: CrossForest
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
The Name parameter specifies the name of the new role group. The name can have a maximum of 64 characters. If the name contains spaces, enclose the name in quotation marks (").

Note: If you create a linked role group, we recommend that you include the name of the foreign forest in the name of the role group so that you can more easily associate the linked role group and the associated foreign forest. This is especially important if you have multiple forests.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Exchange Online Protection

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Exchange Online Protection

Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CustomConfigWriteScope
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The CustomConfigWriteScope parameter specifies the existing configuration-based management scope to associate with management role assignments created with this role group. If the management scope name contains spaces, enclose the name in quotation marks ("). Use the Get-ManagementScope cmdlet to retrieve a list of existing management scopes.

```yaml
Type: ManagementScopeIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CustomRecipientWriteScope
The CustomRecipientWriteScope parameter specifies the existing recipient-based management scope to associate with management role assignments created with this role group. If the management scope name contains spaces, enclose the name in quotation marks (").

Use the Get-ManagementScope cmdlet to retrieve a list of existing management scopes.

If you use the CustomRecipientWriteScope parameter, you can't use the RecipientOrganizationalUnitScope parameter.

```yaml
Type: ManagementScopeIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Exchange Online Protection

```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: CrossForest

You can specify multiple members separated by commas (`Value1,Value2,...ValueN`). If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (`"Value 1","Value 2",..."Value N"`).

If you use the Members parameter, you can't use the LinkedForeignGroup, LinkedDomainController or LinkedCredential parameters.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Exchange Online Protection

```

### -RecipientOrganizationalUnitScope
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The RecipientOrganizationalUnitScope parameter specifies the organizational unit (OU) scope added to the role assignments created when the role group is created. If you use the RecipientOrganizationalUnitScope parameter, you can't use the CustomRecipientWriteScope parameter. To specify an OU, use the syntax: domain/ou. If the OU name contains spaces, enclose the domain and OU in quotation marks (").

```yaml
Type: OrganizationalUnitIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
