# Remove-SystemMessage

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Remove-SystemMessage cmdlet to remove custom system messages. System messages are delivery status notifications (also known as DSNs, non-delivery reports, NDRs or bounce messages) and quota messages.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-SystemMessage [-Identity] <SystemMessageIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You can't remove a default system message that's included with Exchange. When you remove a custom system message, the message text reverts to the text in the corresponding system message (if any) that's included with Exchange.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-SystemMessage En\Internal\5.7.9
```

This example removes the specified custom NDR (combination of language, audience, and enhanced status code values).

### Example 2
```powershell
Remove-SystemMessage En\WarningMailbox
```

This example removes the specified custom quota message (combination of language and quota values).

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
TheIdentity parameter specifies the custom system message that you want to remove. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the system message. For example:

- Identity

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

The identity value of a system message uses one of these formats:

- System messages for enhanced status codes: \<Language\>\\\<Internal \| External\>\\\<DSNcode\>. For example, En\\Internal\\5.1.2 or Ja\\External\\5.1.2.

- System messages for quotas: \<Language\>\\\<QuotaMessageType\>. For example, En\\ProhibitSendReceiveMailBox.

\<Language\>: For the list of supported language codes, see [Supported languages for NDRs](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow/non-delivery-reports-and-bounce-messages/ndr-procedures#supported-languages-for-ndrs).

\<DSNcode\>: Valid values are 4.x.y or 5.x.y where x and y are one to three digit numbers. To see the enhanced system code values that are currently used by custom system messages, run the command Get-SystemMessage.

\<QuotaMessageType\>: Valid value are:

Mailbox size quotas:

ProhibitSendReceiveMailBox: A mailbox exceeds its ProhibitSendReceiveQuota limit.

ProhibitSendMailbox: A mailbox exceeds its ProhibitSendQuota limit.

WarningMailbox: A mailbox exceeds its IssueWarningQuota limit when it has a ProhibitSendQuota or ProhibitSendReceiveQuota limit configured.

WarningMailboxUnlimitedSize: A mailbox exceeds its IssueWarningQuota limit when it doesn't have a ProhibitSendQuota or ProhibitSendReceiveQuota limit configured.

Public folder size quotas:

ProhibitPostPublicFolder: A public folder exceeds its ProhibitPostQuota limit.

WarningPublicFolder: A public folder exceeds its IssueWarningQuota limit when it has a ProhibitPostQuota limit configured.

WarningPublicFolderUnlimitedSize: A public folder exceeds its IssueWarningQuota limit when it doesn't have a ProhibitPostQuota limit configured.

Maximum number of messages in a mailbox folder:

ProhibitReceiveMailboxMessagesPerFolderCount: A mailbox exceeds its MailboxMessagesPerFolderCountReceiveQuota limit.

WarningMailboxMessagesPerFolderCount: A mailbox exceeds its MailboxMessagesPerFolderCountWarningQuota limit when it has a MailboxMessagesPerFolderCountReceiveQuota limit configured.

WarningMailboxMessagesPerFolderUnlimitedCount: A mailbox exceeds its MailboxMessagesPerFolderCountWarningQuota limit when it doesn't have a MailboxMessagesPerFolderCountReceiveQuota limit configured.

Maximum number of subfolders in a mailbox folder:

ProhibitReceiveFolderHierarchyChildrenCountCount: A mailbox exceeds its FolderHierarchyChildrenCountReceiveQuota limit.

WarningFolderHierarchyChildrenCount: A mailbox exceeds its FolderHierarchyChildrenCountWarningQuota limit when it has a FolderHierarchyChildrenCountReceiveQuota limit configured.

WarningFolderHierarchyChildrenUnlimitedCount: A mailbox exceeds its FolderHierarchyChildrenCountWarningQuota limit when it doesn't have a FolderHierarchyChildrenCountReceiveQuota limit configured.

ProhibitReceiveFoldersCount: A mailbox exceeds its FoldersCountReceiveQuota limit.

WarningFoldersCount: A mailbox exceeds its FoldersCountWarningQuota limit when it has a FoldersCountReceiveQuota limit configured.

WarningFoldersCountUnlimited A mailbox exceeds its FoldersCountWarningQuota limit when it doesn't have a FoldersCountReceiveQuota limit configured.

Maximum number of levels (depth) in a mailbox folder:

ProhibitReceiveFolderHierarchyDepth: A mailbox exceeds its FolderHierarchyDepthWarningQuota limit.

WarningFolderHierarchyDepth: A mailbox exceeds its FolderHierarchyDepthWarningQuota limit when it has a FolderHierarchyDepthReceiveQuota limit configured.

WarningFolderHierarchyDepthUnlimited: : A mailbox exceeds its FolderHierarchyDepthWarningQuota limit when it doesn't have a FolderHierarchyDepthReceiveQuota limit configured.

```yaml
Type: SystemMessageIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
