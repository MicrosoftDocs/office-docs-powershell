  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Case
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Case parameter specifies the name of the eDiscovery case that you want to modify. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

    To see the available eDiscovery cases, use the Get-ComplianceCase cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Member

  description: |+
    The Member parameter specifies the user that you want to add to the eDiscovery case. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the user. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - GUID

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Add-ComplianceCaseMember
name: Add-ComplianceCaseMember
description: |-
  You use eDiscovery cases to control who can create, access, and manage compliance searches in your organization. You use the New-ComplianceCase cmdlet to create eDiscovery cases. The eDiscovery Manager who created the case is automatically added as a member of the case.

  To add a member of an eDiscovery case, the user needs to be a member of the Reviewer or eDiscovery Manager role groups. When a member of the eDiscovery Manager role group is a member of an eDiscovery case, the user can:

  - Add and remove case members.
  - Create and edit compliance searches associated with a case.
  - Perform compliance actions (for example, export) on the results of a compliance search.

  To use this cmdlet in Security & Compliance PowerShell, you need to be assigned permissions. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions).
