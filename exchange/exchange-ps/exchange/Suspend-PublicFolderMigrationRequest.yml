### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Suspend-PublicFolderMigrationRequest cmdlet to suspend serial public folder migration requests (requests created by the New-PublicFolderMigrationRequest cmdlet). You can suspend active requests before they reach the status CompletionInProgress. You resume suspended requests by using the Resume-PublicFolderMigrationRequest cmdlet.

  **Note**: Support for serial migration of public folders ended in Exchange 2013 Cumulative Update 8 (CU8), and the cmdlets are no longer available in Exchange Online. Instead, use the corresponding **\*-MigrationBatch** and **\*-PublicFolderMailboxMigration\*** cmdlets.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
