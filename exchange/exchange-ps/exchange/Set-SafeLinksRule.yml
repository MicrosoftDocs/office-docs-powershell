examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    Set-SafeLinksRule -Identity "Engineering Department URL Rule" -ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs fabrikam.com
  description: |-
    This example modifies the existing Safe Links rule named Engineering Department URL Rule to exclude messages sent to recipients in the fabrikam.com domain.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Set-SafeLinksRule -Identity "Contoso All" -RecipientDomainIs (Get-AcceptedDomain).Name
  description: |-
    This example modifies the existing Safe Links rule named Contoso All to include messages sent to recipients in all accepted domains in the organization.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    $Data = Import-Csv -Path "C:\Data\SafeLinksDomains.csv"

    $SLDomains = $Data.Domains

    Set-SafeLinksRule -Identity "Contoso All" -RecipientDomainIs $SLDomains
  description: |-
    This example is similar to Example 2, but in this example, the Safe Links rule includes messages sent to recipients in the accepted domains specified in a .csv file.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comments
  description: |+
    The Comments parameter specifies informative comments for the rule, such as what the rule is used for or how it has changed over time. The length of the comment can't exceed 1024 characters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs
  description: |+
    The ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients with email addresses in the specified domains. You can specify multiple domains separated by commas.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="RecipientIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ExceptIfSentTo
  description: |+
    The ExceptIfSentTo parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients in messages. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RecipientIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ExceptIfSentToMemberOf
  description: |+
    The ExceptIfSentToMemberOf parameter specifies an exception that looks for messages sent to members of distribution groups, mail-enabled security groups, or sent to Microsoft 365 Groups. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

    If you remove the group after you create the rule, no exception is made for messages that are sent to members of the group.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RuleIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the Safe Links rule that you want to modify.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the rule. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the Safe Links rule. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Priority
  description: |+
    The Priority parameter specifies a priority value for the rule that determines the order of rule processing. A lower integer value indicates a higher priority, the value 0 is the highest priority and rules can't have the same priority value.

    Valid values and the default value for this parameter depend on the number of existing rules. For example, if there are 8 existing rules:

    - Valid priority values for the existing 8 rules are from 0 through 7.
    - Valid priority values for a new rule (the 9th rule) are from 0 through 8.
    - The default value for a new rule (the 9th rule) is 8.

    If you modify the priority value of a rule, the position of the rule in the list changes to match the priority value you specify. In other words, if you set the priority value of a rule to the same value as an existing rule, the priority value of the existing rule and all other lower priority rules after it is increased by 1.

  name: RecipientDomainIs
  description: |+
    The RecipientDomainIs parameter specifies a condition that looks for recipients with email addresses in the specified domains. You can specify multiple domains separated by commas.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SafeLinksPolicyIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SafeLinksPolicy
  description: |+
    The SafeLinksPolicy parameter specifies the Safe Links policy that's associated with this Safe Links rule. The rule defines the conditions and the policy defines the actions.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't specify a Safe Attachments policy that's already associated with another Safe Attachments rule.

description: |-
  Safe Links is a feature in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that checks links in email messages to see if they lead to malicious web sites. When a user clicks a link in a message, the URL is temporarily rewritten and checked against a list of known, malicious web sites. Safe Links includes the URL trace reporting feature to help determine who has clicked through to a malicious web site.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Different types of recipient conditions use AND logic (the recipient must satisfy **all** specified conditions). Different types of recipient exceptions use OR logic (the recipient must satisfy **any** of the specified exceptions). For more information, see [Recipient filters in Safe Links policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links-about#recipient-filters-in-safe-links-policies).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
