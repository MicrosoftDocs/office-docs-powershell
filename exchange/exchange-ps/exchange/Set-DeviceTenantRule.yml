parameters:
- type: <xref href="PolicyResourceScope" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ApplyPolicyTo
  description: |+
    The ApplyPolicyTo parameter specifies where to apply the policy in your organization. Valid values for this parameter are:

    - ExchangeOnline
    - SharePointOnline
    - ExchangeAndSharePoint

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BlockUnsupportedDevices
  description: |+
    The BlockUnsupportedDevices parameter specifies whether to block access to your organization by unsupported devices. Valid values for this parameter are:

    - $true: Unsupported devices are blocked.
    - $false: Unsupported devices are allowed.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExclusionList
  description: |+
    The ExclusionList parameter specifies the security groups to exclude from this policy. Members of the specified security groups who have non-compliant devices are not affected by block access actions.

    This parameter uses the GUID value of the group. To find this GUID value, run the command Get-Group | Format-Table Name,GUID.

    To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: `Value1,Value2,...ValueN`. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ComplianceRuleIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the name of the mobile device tenant rule that you want to modify, but there's only one in your organization. The name of the rule is a GUID. For example, 7577c5f3-05a4-4f55-a0a3-82aab5e98c84. You can find the name value by running the command Get-DeviceTenantRule | Format-List Name.

  The cmdlets in Basic Mobility and Security are described in the following list:

  - DeviceTenantPolicy and DeviceTenantRule cmdlets: A policy that defines whether to block or allow mobile device access to Exchange Online email by unsupported devices that use Exchange ActiveSync only. This setting applies to all users in your organization. Both allow and block scenarios allow reporting for unsupported devices, and you can specify exceptions to the policy based on security groups.
  - DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy and DeviceConditionalAccessRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device access to Microsoft 365 for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups. Unsupported devices are not allowed to enroll in Basic Mobility and Security.
  - DeviceConfigurationPolicy and DeviceConfigurationRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device settings for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups.
  - Get-DevicePolicy: Returns all Basic Mobility and Security policies regardless of type (DeviceTenantPolicy, DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy or DeviceConfigurationPolicy).

  For more information about Basic Mobility and Security, see [Overview of Basic Mobility and Security for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/basic-mobility-security/overview).
