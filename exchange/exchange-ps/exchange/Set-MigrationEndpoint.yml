  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="AuthenticationMethod" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Authentication
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The Authentication parameter specifies the authentication method used by the remote mail server.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credentials
  description: |+
    The Credentials parameter specifies the username and password for connecting to the remote endpoint. Credentials should be used when creating either a staged or cutover Exchange endpoint or a RemoteMove endpoint.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

    The ServiceAccountKeyFileData parameter is used to specify information needed to authenticate as a service account. The data should come from the JSON key file that is downloaded when the service account that has been granted access to your remote tenant is created.

    A valid value for this parameter requires you to read the file to a byte-encoded object using the following syntax: `([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('<Path>\<FileName>'))`. You can use this command as the parameter value, or you can write the output to a variable (`$data = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('<Path>\<FileName>')`) and use the variable as the parameter value (`$data`).

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Set-MigrationEndpoint
name: Set-MigrationEndpoint
description: |-
  Use the Set-MigrationEndpoint cmdlet to configure settings for different types of migration:

  - Cross-forest move: Move mailboxes between two different on-premises Exchange forests. Cross-forest moves require the use of a RemoteMove endpoint.
  - Remote move: In a hybrid deployment, a remote move involves onboarding or offboarding migrations. Remote moves require the use of a RemoteMove endpoint. Onboarding moves mailboxes from an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online, and uses a RemoteMove endpoint as the source endpoint of the migration batch. Offboarding moves mailboxes from Exchange Online to an on-premises Exchange organization and uses a RemoteMove endpoint as the target endpoint of the migration batch.
  - Cutover Exchange migration: Migrate all mailboxes in an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online. Cutover Exchange migration requires the use of an Exchange endpoint.
  - Staged Exchange migration: Migrate a subset of mailboxes from an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online. Staged Exchange migration requires the use of an Exchange endpoint.
  - IMAP migration: Migrate mailbox data from an on-premises Exchange organization or other email system to Exchange Online. For an IMAP migration, you must first create the cloud-based mailboxes before you migrate mailbox data. IMAP migrations require the use of an IMAP endpoint.
  - Gmail migration: Migration mailbox data from a Google Workspace tenant to Exchange Online. For a Google Workspace migration, you must first create the cloud-based mail users or mailboxes before you migrate mailbox data. Google Workspace migrations require the use of a Gmail endpoint.
  - Local: Move mailboxes between different servers or databases within a single on-premises Exchange forest. Local moves don't require the use of an endpoint.

  For more information about the different move and migration scenarios, see:

  - [Mailbox moves in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/recipients/mailbox-moves)
  - [Manage on-premises mailbox moves in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/architecture/mailbox-servers/manage-mailbox-moves)

  Changes made to an endpoint that affect the individual users within the batch are applied starting at the next time that the batch is processed. If you are running this cmdlet in the cloud-based service and wish to speed up the application of these settings, consider running the Set-MigrationBatch cmdlet with the -Update parameter.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
