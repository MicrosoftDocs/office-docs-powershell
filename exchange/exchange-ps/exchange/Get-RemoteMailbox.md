# Get-RemoteMailbox

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Get-RemoteMailbox cmdlet to retrieve the mail-related attributes of users in the on-premises organization that have associated mailboxes in the cloud-based service.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-RemoteMailbox cmdlet retrieves the mail-related attributes of a mail user in the on-premises Active Directory. It doesn't retrieve the attributes of the associated cloud-based mailbox. Most of the mail-related attributes of the on-premises mail user and the associated cloud-based mailbox should be the same. However, the cloud-based mailbox has additional attributes that you can't view by using this cmdlet. To view the attributes of the cloud-based mailbox, you need to use the Exchange admin center in the cloud-based service, or use remote PowerShell to connect to your cloud-based organization and run the Get-Mailbox cmdlet.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-RemoteMailbox
```

This example returns a summary list of all remote mailboxes in your organization.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-RemoteMailbox -Identity laura@contoso.com | Format-List
```

This example returns a detailed information for the remote mailbox for the user laura@contoso.com.

### Example 3
```powershell
$Credentials = Get-Credential; Get-RemoteMailbox -Credential $Credentials
```

This example uses alternate credentials to retrieve a list of one or more mail-enabled users with mailboxes in the service. This is useful if the account you typically use doesn't have administrative permissions. The credentials are used to access the on-premises Active Directory domain controllers.

First, run the following command to prompt you for your credentials and then store them in a variable. Then retrieve a list of remote mailboxes using the credentials you provided by using the second command.

## PARAMETERS

### -Anr
The Anr parameter specifies a string on which to perform an ambiguous name resolution (ANR) search. You can specify a partial string and search for objects with an attribute that matches that string. The default attributes searched are:

- CommonName (CN)

- DisplayName

- FirstName

- LastName

- Alias

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: AnrSet
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Archive
The Archive switch is required to return the user's archive mailbox in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.

A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter
The Filter parameter uses OPath syntax to filter the results by the specified properties and values. The search criteria uses the syntax `"Property -ComparisonOperator 'Value'"`.

- Enclose the whole OPath filter in double quotation marks " ". If the filter contains system values (for example, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null`), use single quotation marks ' ' instead. Although this parameter is a string (not a system block), you can also use braces { }, but only if the filter doesn't contain variables.

- Property is a filterable property. For more information about the filterable properties, see [Filterable properties for the Filter parameter](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/filter-properties).

- ComparisonOperator is an OPath comparison operator (for example `-eq` for equals and `-like` for string comparison). For more information about comparison operators, see [about_Comparison_Operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comparison_operators).

- Value is the property value to search for. Enclose text values and variables in single quotation marks (`'Value'` or `'$Variable'`). If a variable value contains single quotation marks, you need to identify (escape) the single quotation marks to expand the variable correctly. For example, instead of `'$User'`, use `'$($User -Replace "'","''")'`. Don't enclose integers or system values (for example, `500`, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null`).

You can chain multiple search criteria together using the logical operators `-and` and `-or`. For example, `"Criteria1 -and Criteria2"` or `"(Criteria1 -and Criteria2) -or Criteria3"`.

For detailed information about OPath filters in Exchange, see [Additional OPATH syntax information](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/recipient-filters#additional-opath-syntax-information).

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the remote mailbox that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the remote mailbox. For example:

- Name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- \<domain name\>\\\<account name\>

- Email address

- GUID

- LegacyExchangeDN

- SamAccountName

- User ID or user principal name (UPN)

```yaml
Type: RemoteMailboxIdParameter
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IgnoreDefaultScope
The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope.

Using the IgnoreDefaultScope switch introduces the following restrictions:

- You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.

- You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OnPremisesOrganizationalUnit
The OnPremisesOrganizationalUnit parameter filters the results by the object's location in Active Directory.

Valid input for this parameter is an organizational unit (OU) or domain that's returned by the Get-OrganizationalUnit cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OU or domain. For example:

- Name

- Canonical name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

```yaml
Type: OrganizationalUnitIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ReadFromDomainController
The ReadFromDomainController switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you run the command Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true to include all objects in the forest and you don't use the ReadFromDomainController switch, it's possible that information will be read from a global catalog that has outdated information. When you use the ReadFromDomainController switch, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information. You don't have to specify a value with this switch.

By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResultSize
The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SortBy
The SortBy parameter specifies the property to sort the results by. You can sort by only one property at a time. The results are sorted in ascending order.

If the default view doesn't include the property you're sorting by, you can append the command with | Format-Table -Auto \<Property1\>,\<Property2\>... to create a new view that contains all of the properties that you want to see. Wildcards (\*) in the property names are supported.

You can sort by the following properties:

- Name

- DisplayName

- Alias

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
