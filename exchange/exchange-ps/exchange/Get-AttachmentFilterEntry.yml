  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

description: |-
  On Edge Transport servers, the Attachment Filtering agent blocks attachments in messages based on the content type and the file name of the attachment. The configuration of the Attachment Filtering agent determines how messages that contain the specified attachments are processed. For more information about how to configure the Attachment Filtering agent, see [Set-AttachmentFilterListConfig](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-attachmentfilterlistconfig).

  On Edge Transport servers, you need to be a member of the local Administrators group to run this cmdlet.
