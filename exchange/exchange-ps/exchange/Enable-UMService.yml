### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Enable-UMService cmdlet to set the status of an Exchange Server 2010 Unified Messaging (UM) server to enabled. This setting enables the Unified Messaging server to process UM calls.

  You can run this cmdlet in Exchange 2013 or Exchange 2016, but the target server must be an Exchange 2010 UM server. You can't use this cmdlet to enable the UM service on Exchange 2013 or Exchange 2016 Mailbox servers.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UMServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the Exchange 2010 UM server that you want to enable. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the UM server. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - ExchangeLegacyDN
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Enable-UMService

description: |-
  The Enable-UMService cmdlet sets the status of an Exchange server running the Unified Messaging server role. A UM server has a logical status variable controlled using the enable and disable cmdlets. A UM server won't process any new calls unless it's in the enabled state. With the status variable, you can start or stop call processing on a UM server so the UM server can be brought online or taken offline in a controlled way.

  After this task is completed, the UM server is available to answer incoming calls.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
