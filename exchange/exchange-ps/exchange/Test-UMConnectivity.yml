### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Test-UMConnectivity cmdlet to test the operation of Unified Messaging (UM) servers.

  **Note**: This cmdlet works best in Exchange 2010. In later versions of Exchange, the functionality of this cmdlet has been replaced by Managed Availability. For the best results, use the Invoke-MonitoringProbe cmdlet and specify the relevant active monitor probe instead of using this cmdlet.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CallRouter
  description: |+
    The CallRouter switch specifies whether to test the Microsoft Exchange Unified Messaging Call Router service (front-end). You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2013

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateThumbprint
  description: |+
    The CertificateThumbprint parameter specifies the certificate thumbprint used for SIP Secured and Secured mode.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

description: |-
  Two diagnostic tests are designed to test the operation of the Mailbox server software (mode 1) and the operation of the whole system that includes the connected telephony components (mode 2).

  The Test-UMConnectivity cmdlet can be used to test the operation of a Mailbox server and related connected telephony equipment. When you run this cmdlet and include the UMIPGateway parameter, the Mailbox server tests the full end-to-end operation of the Unified Messaging system. This test includes the telephony components connected to the Mailbox server, such as IP gateways, Private Branch eXchanges (PBXs) and cabling. If the UMIPGateway parameter isn't specified, the Mailbox server tests only the operation of the Unified Messaging components that are installed and configured on the server.

  When you run this cmdlet in an on-premises Unified Messaging deployment, you need to create a UM IP gateway object for the computer or server that the cmdlet is testing. When you create the UM IP gateway object, you must configure it with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and that FQDN must match the name of the computer running this cmdlet.

  After this task is complete, the cmdlet will have tested the operation of the Mailbox server and related telephony components.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
