# Get-SystemMessage

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Get-SystemMessage cmdlet to view default or custom system messages. System messages are delivery status notifications (also known as DSNs, non-delivery reports, NDRs or bounce messages) and quota messages.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Get-SystemMessage [[-Identity] <SystemMessageIdParameter>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Original
```
Get-SystemMessage [-Original] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
NDRs are issued to the senders of email messages that haven't reached their intended recipients. Quota messages are issued to users whose mailboxes or public folders have reached the specific warning, prohibit send, or prohibit receive quotas. Custom NDRs and quota messages replace the default messages that are included with Exchange.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-SystemMessage
```

This example displays a summary list of all custom system messages in your organization.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-SystemMessage En\Internal\5.3.2 | Format-List
```

This example displays detailed information for the specified custom NDR (combination of language, audience, and enhanced status code values).

### Example 3
```powershell
Get-SystemMessage En\WarningMailbox | Format-List
```

This example displays detailed information for the specified custom quota message (combination of language and quota values).

### Example 4
```powershell
Get-SystemMessage -Original | Select-Object -Property Identity,DsnCode,Language,Text | ConvertTo-Html | Set-Content -Path "C:\My Documents\Default System Messages.html"
```

This example outputs the list of all default system messages in all languages to an HTML file named C:\\My Documents\\Default System Messages.html.

You should output the list to a file, because the list is very long, and you'll receive errors if you don't have the required language packs installed.

## PARAMETERS

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.
