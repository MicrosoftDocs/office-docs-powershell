  code: |-
    Disable-RemoteMailbox "Kim Akers"
  description: |-
    This example removes the cloud-based mailbox that's associated with the on-premises mail user named Kim Akers. The mail user is automatically converted to a regular user. This example assumes that you've already removed the Exchange Online license for the mailbox, and that directory synchronization has been configured.

    Disable-RemoteMailbox "David Strome" -Archive
  description: |-
    This example removes the cloud-based archive mailbox but keeps the cloud-based mailbox that's associated with the on-premises mail user named David Strome. This example assumes directory synchronization has been configured.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Archive
  description: |+
    The Archive switch specifies whether to disconnect the cloud-based archive mailbox from the associated cloud-based mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    The on-premises mail user and its associated cloud-based mailbox aren't removed if you use this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    This cmdlet has a built-in pause, so use `-Confirm:$false` to skip the confirmation.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Server 2010

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RemoteMailboxIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the cloud-based mailbox. Valid values are:

    - ADObjectID
    - GUID
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Domain\\Username
    - User principal name (UPN)
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - Email address
    - User alias

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnoreDefaultScope
  description: |+
    The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange PowerShell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch enables the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope, but also introduces the following restrictions:

    - You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.
    - You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnoreLegalHold
  description: |+
    The IgnoreLegalHold switch ignores the legal hold status of the remote user. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch disables the instance of the remote object in the on-premises organization, and the request to disable the mailbox is synchronized to the cloud. However, if the cloud mailbox is on hold, the request to disable the mailbox is blocked, and an error is returned.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Disable-RemoteMailbox
name: Disable-RemoteMailbox
description: |-
  Use the Disable-RemoteMailbox cmdlet to perform the following actions:

  - Remove a cloud-based mailbox but keep the associated on-premises user account. To do this, you first need to remove the Exchange Online license for the mailbox. Otherwise, the mailbox won't be removed. The on-premises mail user is automatically converted to a regular user object. You can mail-enable the on-premises user object using the Enable-MailUser cmdlet.
  - Disconnect a cloud-based archive mailbox from a cloud-based mailbox. The cloud-based mailbox and the associated on-premises mail user are preserved.

  If you want to remove both the cloud-based mailbox and the associated on-premises mail user, use the Remove-RemoteMailbox cmdlet.

  Directory synchronization must be configured correctly for a mailbox to be removed from the cloud. Removal of the cloud-based mailbox isn't immediate and depends on the directory synchronization schedule.

  **Notes**:

  - If you are deprovisioning a cloud mailbox and its associated online archive, you must first disable the online archive with the command `Disable-RemoteMailbox <User> -Archive` and then perform a directory synchronization prior to disabling the remote mailbox. Attempting to disable both the online archive and cloud mailbox without a sync between them may result in an ArchiveGuid mismatch and validation error.
  - Due to the current service architecture, you need to convert shared mailboxes to user mailboxes prior to running the Disable-RemoteMailbox cmdlet.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
