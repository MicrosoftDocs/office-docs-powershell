parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  You can check the status by running the following command: `Get-ComplianceTagStorage | Format-List Enabled,DistributionStatus`. The value True for the Enabled property and the value Success for the DistributionStatus property indicates the Enable-ComplianceTagStorage cmdlet has already been run in the organization, and you don't need to run it again. If you run the cmdlet unnecessarily, you'll get a warning, and the DistributionStatus property changes to the value Pending for a few minutes before returning to the value Success.

  To use this cmdlet in Security & Compliance PowerShell, you need to be assigned permissions. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions).
