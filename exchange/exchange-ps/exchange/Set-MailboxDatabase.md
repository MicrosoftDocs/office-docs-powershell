## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-MailboxDatabase "Mailbox Database01" -DeletedItemRetention 7.00:00:00
```

This example sets the length of time that deleted items are retained. If a specific mailbox has its own item retention set, that value is used instead of this value, which is set on the mailbox database.

### Example 2
```powershell
Set-MailboxDatabase <Mailbox Database Name> -RpcClientAccessServer <ClientAccessServer or ClientAccessServerArrayID>
```

In Exchange Server 2010, this example updates a mailbox database so that all client connections for mailboxes on the database come through the Client Access server or Client Access server array. You can also use this command to change the Client Access server or Client Access server array through which the client is connecting to the Mailbox server.

For more information about RPC access through Client Access servers, see [Set-RpcClientAccess](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-rpcclientaccess) and [Set-ClientAccessArray](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-clientaccessarray).

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox database that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

```

### -AutoDagExcludeFromMonitoring
The AutoDagExcludedFromMonitoring parameter specifies whether to exclude the mailbox database from the ServerOneCopyMonitor, which alerts an administrator when a replicated database has only one healthy copy available. Valid values are:

- $true: No alert is issued when there's only one healthy copy of the replicated database.

- $false: An alert is issued when there's only one healthy copy of the replicated database. This is the default value.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AutoDatabaseMountDial
This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

```yaml
Type: AutoDatabaseMountDial
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BackgroundDatabaseMaintenance
The BackgroundDatabaseMaintenance parameter specifies whether the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) performs database maintenance. Valid values are:

- $true: The mailbox database reads the object during database mount and initializes the database to perform background maintenance. This is the default value.

- $false: The mailbox database reads the object during database mount and initializes the database without the option to perform background maintenance.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CalendarLoggingQuota
The CalendarLoggingQuota parameter specifies the maximum size of the log in the Recoverable Items folder of the mailbox that stores changes to calendar items. When the log exceeds this size, calendar logging is disabled until messaging records management (MRM) removes older calendar logs to free up more space.

A valid value is a number up to 1.999999999 terabytes (2199023254528 bytes) or the value unlimited. The default value is 6 gigabytes (6442450944 bytes).

When you enter a value, qualify the value with one of the following units:

- B (bytes)

- KB (kilobytes)

- MB (megabytes)

- GB (gigabytes)

- TB (terabytes)

Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte.

The value of this parameter must be less than or equal to the value of the RecoverableItemsQuota parameter.

This setting applies to all mailboxes in the database that don't have their own calendar logging quota configured.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CircularLoggingEnabled
The CircularLoggingEnabled parameter specifies whether circular logging is enabled for the database. Valid values are:

- $true: Circular logging is enabled.

- $false: Circular logging is disabled. This is the default value.

For more information about circular logging, see [Exchange Native Data Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery-exchange-2013-help#exchange-native-data-protection).

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

```

### -DataMoveReplicationConstraint
The DataMoveReplicationConstraint parameter specifies the throttling behavior for high availability mailbox moves. Valid values are:

- None: Moves shouldn't be throttled to ensure high availability. Use this setting if the database isn't part of a database availability group (DAG).

- AllCopies (Exchange 2013 or earlier): If the database is replicated, all passive mailbox database copies must have the most recent changes synchronized.

- AllDatacenters (Exchange 2013 or earlier): If the database is replicated to multiple Active Directory sites, at least one passive mailbox database copy in each site must have the most recent changes replicated.

- CINoReplication (Exchange 2013 or later): Moves shouldn't be throttled to ensure high availability, but the content indexing service must be up to date.

- CISecondCopy (Exchange 2013 or later): At least one passive mailbox database copy must have the most recent changes synchronized, and the content indexing service must be up to date. Use this setting to indicate that the database is replicated to one or more mailbox database copies.

- CISecondDatacenter (Exchange 2013 or later): At least one passive mailbox database copy in another Active Directory site must have the most recent changes replicated, and the content indexing service must be up to date. Use this setting to indicate that the database is replicated to database copies in multiple Active Directory sites.

- SecondCopy: At least one passive mailbox database copy must have the most recent changes synchronized. This is the default value. Use this setting to indicate that the database is replicated to one or more mailbox database copies.

- SecondDatacenter: At least one passive mailbox database copy in another Active Directory site must have the most recent changes replicated. Use this setting to indicate that the database is replicated to database copies in multiple Active Directory sites.

Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DeletedItemRetention
The DeletedItemRetention parameter specifies the length of time to keep deleted items in the Recoverable Items\\Deletions folder in mailboxes. Items are moved to this folder when the user deletes items from the Deleted Items folder, empties the Deleted Items folder, or deletes items by using Shift+Delete.

To specify a value, enter it as a time span: dd.hh:mm:ss where dd = days, hh = hours, mm = minutes and ss = seconds.

Valid values are 00:00:00 to 24855.03:14:07. The default value is 14.00:00:00 (14 days).

This setting applies to all mailboxes in the database that don't have their own deleted item retention value configured.

```

### -EventHistoryRetentionPeriod
The EventHistoryRetentionPeriod parameter specifies the length of time to keep event data. This event data is stored in the event history table in the Exchange store. It includes information about changes to various objects in the mailbox database. You can use this parameter to prevent the event history table from becoming too large and using too much disk space.

To specify a value, enter it as a time span: dd.hh:mm:ss where dd = days, hh = hours, mm = minutes, and ss = seconds.

Valid values are 00:00:01 to 30.00:00:00. The default value is 7.00:00:00 (7 days).

- $true: The database is excluded from new or move mailbox operations when you don't specify the target mailbox database.

- $false: The database can be used in new or move mailbox operations when you don't specify the target mailbox database. This is the default value.

The value is automatically set to $true when you set the IsExcludedFromProvisioningDueToLogicalCorruption parameter to $true, and isn't changed back to $false when you set the IsExcludedFromProvisioningDueToLogicalCorruption parameter back to $false. In the case of database corruption, you should set the IsExcludedFromProvisioning parameter back to $false only after you fix the corruption issue or recreate the database.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named

- $false: This is the default value. The database can be used in new or move mailbox operations when you don't specify the target mailbox database. You should manually configure this value only after the database corruption is fixed, or after the database is recreated.

Note that setting this parameter to the value $true has these additional effects on the database:

- The IsExcludedFromProvisioningReason parameter requires a value if it doesn't already have one.

- The unmodifiable IsExcludedFromProvisioningBy property is populated with your user account.

The QuotaNotificationSchedule parameter specifies when quota messages are sent to mailboxes that have reached one of the quota values.

The syntax for this parameter is: StartDay.Hour:Minute \[AM/PM\]-EndDay.Hour:Minute \[AM/PM\].

You can use the following values for days:

- Full name of the day.

- Abbreviated name of the day.

- Integer from 0 through 6, where 0 = Sunday.

You can enter the time in 24 hour format and omit the AM/PM value. If you enter the time in 12 time hour format, include a space between the time and the AM/PM value.

You can mix and match date/time formats.

The start time and end time must be at least 15 minutes apart. Minutes are rounded down to 0, 15, 30, or 45.

Here are some examples:

- "Sun.11:30 PM-Mon.1:30 AM"

- "6.22:00-6.22:15" (Run from Saturday at 10:00 PM until Saturday at 10:15 PM.)

- "Sun.1:15 AM-Monday.23:00"

```yaml
Type: Schedule
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RecoverableItemsQuota
The RecoverableItemsQuota parameter specifies the maximum size for the Recoverable Items folder of the mailbox. If the Recoverable Items folder reaches or exceeds this size, it no longer accepts messages.

A valid value is a number up to 1.999999999 terabytes (2199023254528 bytes) or the value unlimited. The default value is 30 gigabytes (32212254720 bytes).

When you enter a number, you can qualify it with one of the following units:

- B (bytes)

- KB (kilobytes)

- MB (megabytes)

- GB (gigabytes)

- TB (terabytes)

Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte.

The RecoverableItemsQuota value must be greater than or equal to the RecoverableItemsWarningQuota value.

This settings applies to all mailboxes in the database that don't have their own Recoverable Items quota configured.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RecoverableItemsWarningQuota
The RecoverableItemsWarningQuota parameter specifies the warning threshold for the size of the Recoverable Items folder for the mailbox. If the Recoverable Items folder reaches or exceeds this size, Exchange logs an event to the application event log.

A valid value is a number up to 1.999999999 terabytes (2199023254528 bytes) or the value unlimited. The default value is 20 gigabytes (21474836480 bytes).

When you enter a number, you can qualify it with one of the following units:

- B (bytes)

- KB (kilobytes)

- MB (megabytes)

- GB (gigabytes)

- TB (terabytes)

Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte.

The RecoverableItemsWarningQuota value must be less than or equal to the RecoverableItemsQuota value.

This settings applies to all mailboxes in the database that don't have their own Recoverable Items warning quota configured.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RetainDeletedItemsUntilBackup
The RetainDeletedItemsUntilBackup parameter specifies whether to keep items in the Recoverable Items\\Deletions folder of the mailbox until the next database backup occurs. Valid values are:

- $true: Deleted items are kept until the next mailbox database backup. This value could effectively override the deleted item retention and recoverable items quota values.

- $false: Retention of deleted items doesn't depend on a backup of the mailbox database. This is the default value.

For more information, see [Recoverable Items folder in Exchange Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/recoverable-items-folder/recoverable-items-folder).

This settings applies to all mailboxes in the database that don't have this value specifically configured.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RpcClientAccessServer
This parameter is available or functional only in Exchange Server 2010.

The RpcClientAccessServer parameter specifies the Client Access server or Client Access server array through which RPC clients (for example, Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 clients) access their mailboxes. This feature is supported for all versions of Outlook.

When connecting with Outlook 2003 clients, RPC encryption is disabled by default. Unless RPC encryption is enabled on Outlook 2003 or disabled on the server, Outlook 2003 clients won't be able to connect. For more information, see [Understanding RPC Client Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2010/ee332317(v=exchg.141)).

```yaml
Type: ClientAccessServerOrArrayIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
