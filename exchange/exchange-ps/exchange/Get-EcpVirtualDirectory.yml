### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Get-EcpVirtualDirectory cmdlet to view Exchange Control Panel (ECP) virtual directories that are used in Internet Information Services (IIS) on Microsoft Exchange servers. The Exchange admin center (EAC) uses the ECP virtual directories.

  The ECP web management interface was introduced in Exchange Server 2010. In Exchange Server 2013 and Exchange Server 2016, the EAC virtual directories and the corresponding management cmdlets still use ECP in the name. You can use these cmdlets to manage ECP virtual directories on Exchange 2010, Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2016 servers.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ADPropertiesOnly
  description: |+
    The ADPropertiesOnly switch specifies whether to return only the virtual directory properties that are stored in Active Directory. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you don't use this switch, the properties in Active Directory and in the Internet Information Services (IIS) metabase are returned.

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="VirtualDirectoryIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the ECP virtual directory that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the virtual directory. For example:

    - Name or Server\\Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    The Name value uses the syntax `"VirtualDirectoryName (WebsiteName)"` from the properties of the virtual directory. You can specify the wildcard character (\*) instead of the default website by using the syntax `VirtualDirectoryName*`.

    You can't use the Identity and Server parameters in the same command.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013

  name: Server
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Server parameter specifies the Exchange server that hosts the virtual directory. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - ExchangeLegacyDN

    You can't use the Server and Identity parameters in the same command.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ShowMailboxVirtualDirectories
  description: |+
    The ShowMailboxVirtualDirectories switch shows information about backend virtual directories on Mailbox servers. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    By default, this cmdlet shows information about virtual directories in the Client Access services on Mailbox servers. Client connections are proxied from the Client Access services on Mailbox servers to the backend services on Mailbox servers. Clients don't connect directly to the backend services.

    We recommend that you use this parameter only under the direction of Microsoft Customer Service and Support.
