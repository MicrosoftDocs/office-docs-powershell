# Remove-RemoteMailbox

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Remove-RemoteMailbox cmdlet to remove a mail-enabled user in the on-premises Active Directory and the associated mailbox in the cloud-based service.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-RemoteMailbox [-Identity] <RemoteMailboxIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-IgnoreDefaultScope] [-IgnoreLegalHold] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
With the Remove-RemoteMailbox cmdlet, you can remove an on-premises mail-enabled user and the mailbox from the service. If you only want to remove the mailbox from the service and keep the associated on-premises user, use the Disable-RemoteMailbox cmdlet.

Directory synchronization must be configured correctly for a mailbox to be removed from the service. Removal of the mailbox from the service isn't immediate and depends on the directory synchronization schedule.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-RemoteMailbox "Kim Akers"
```

This example removes the on-premises mail-enabled user Kim Akers and the associated mailbox from the service. This example assumes directory synchronization has been configured.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter identifies the mail-enabled user and the associated mailbox in the service that you want to remove. You can use one of the following values:

- ADObjectID

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Legacy DN

- GUID

- Domain\\Account name

- User principal name (UPN)

- Email address

- Alias

```yaml
Type: RemoteMailboxIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IgnoreDefaultScope
The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session and to use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope.

Using the IgnoreDefaultScope switch introduces the following restrictions:

- You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.

- You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IgnoreLegalHold
The IgnoreLegalHold switch ignores the legal hold status of the mailbox user and allows you to remove the cloud-based mailbox on legal hold.

After you remove a mailbox, you can't include it in a discovery search. Depending on the command parameters you use, removed mailboxes are either purged immediately or when the deleted mailbox retention period expires. Check with your organization's legal or Human Resources department before disabling a mailbox that's on legal hold.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
