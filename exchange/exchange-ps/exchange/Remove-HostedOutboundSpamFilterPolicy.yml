### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

  Use the Remove-HostedOutboundSpamFilterPolicy cmdlet to remove outbound spam filter policies from your cloud-based organization.

  When a policy is removed and there are rules associated with it, the rules are not removed when the policy is removed. This is by design. If you want to remove the associated rules, you need to do this separately via the Remove-HostedOutboundSpamFilterRule cmdlet.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).
