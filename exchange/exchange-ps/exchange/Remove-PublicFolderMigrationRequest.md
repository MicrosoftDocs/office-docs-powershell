# Remove-PublicFolderMigrationRequest

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Remove-PublicFolderMigrationRequest cmdlet to cancel or complete serial public folder migration requests (requests created by the New-PublicFolderMigrationRequest cmdlet). You need to use this cmdlet to remove an existing serial public folder migration request before you can create another one.

**Note**: Support for serial migration of public folders ended in Exchange 2013 Cumulative Update 8 (CU8), and the cmdlets are no longer available in Exchange Online. Instead, use the corresponding **\*-MigrationBatch** and **\*-PublicFolderMailboxMigration\*** cmdlets.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Remove-PublicFolderMigrationRequest [-Identity] <PublicFolderMigrationRequestIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Force]
 [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### MigrationRequestQueue
```
Remove-PublicFolderMigrationRequest -RequestGuid <Guid> -RequestQueue <DatabaseIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The RequestQueue and RequestGuid parameters are for debugging purposes only.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-PublicFolderMigrationRequest | Remove-PublicFolderMigrationRequest
```

This example cancels any public folder migration request that's actively running.

### Example 2
```powershell
Remove-PublicFolderMigrationRequest -RequestQueue MBXDB01 -RequestGuid 25e0eaf2-6cc2-4353-b83e-5cb7b72d441f
```

This example cancels a migration request by using the RequestGuid parameter for a mailbox on MBXDB01.

The RequestGuid and RequestQueue parameters are for debugging purposes only.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the migration request that you want to remove. You can use the following values:

- Name

- RequestGUID

You can't use this parameter with the RequestGuid or RequestQueue parameters.

```yaml
Type: PublicFolderMigrationRequestIdParameter
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RequestGuid
The RequestGuid parameter identifies the migration request to remove by its RequestGUID value. This parameter also requires the RequestQueue parameter.

You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

```yaml
Type: Guid
Parameter Sets: MigrationRequestQueue
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RequestQueue
The RequestQueue parameter identifies the migration request by the mailbox database where the request is being run. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

You need to use this parameter with the RequestGuid parameter.

You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

```yaml
Type: DatabaseIdParameter
Parameter Sets: MigrationRequestQueue
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
The Force switch specifies whether to suppress warning or confirmation messages. You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
