parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowFileRestore
  description: |+
    The AllowFileRestore parameter specifies that the public folder database can be overwritten if the public folder database is restored. The default value is $false.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BackgroundDatabaseMaintenance
  description: |+
    The BackgroundDatabaseMaintenance parameter specifies whether the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) performs database maintenance. The two possible values are $true or $false. If you specify $true, the public folder database reads the object during database mount and initializes the database to perform the background database maintenance. If you specify $false, the public folder database reads the object during database mount and initializes the database without the option to perform the background database maintenance.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CircularLoggingEnabled
  description: |+
    The CircularLoggingEnabled parameter specifies whether to enable circular logging. If you specify a value of $true, circular logging is enabled. The default value is $false.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010

Servers not included on the list aren't included for referrals. If this parameter is set with no servers in the list, there are no public folder referrals.

    The CustomReferralServerList parameter accepts an array in the following format: "serverID:cost". Use a comma to separate multiple servers, for example, "MBXSERVER01:1","MBXSERVER02:5".
