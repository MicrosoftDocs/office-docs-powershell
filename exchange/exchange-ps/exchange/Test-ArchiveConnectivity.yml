  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

description: |-
  Running the Test-ArchiveConnectivity cmdlet validates connectivity to a user's archive mailbox. End-to-end verification includes testing whether an on-premises or cloud-based archive is provisioned for the on-premises mailbox user and whether it's enabled and logging on to the archive mailbox on behalf of the user. Successful completion of the command indicates that processes such as the Managed Folder Assistant and Outlook on the web are able to successfully access the archive mailbox.
