# Get-AuditLogSearch

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-AuditLogSearch cmdlet to return a list of current audit log searches that were created with the New-AdminAuditLogSearch or New-MailboxAuditLogSearch cmdlets. The Get-AuditLogSearch cmdlet also returns audit log searches that are initiated whenever an administrator uses the Exchange admin center (EAC) to export audit logs.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-AuditLogSearch [[-Identity] <AuditLogSearchIdParameter>] [-CreatedAfter <ExDateTime>]
 [-CreatedBefore <ExDateTime>] [-ResultSize <Int32>] [-Type <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Run the Get-AuditLogSearch cmdlet to return a list of pending audit log searches. If an audit log search has been completed, it won't be displayed in the list of audit log searches.
