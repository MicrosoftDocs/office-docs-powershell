# Get-MailboxPlan

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Get-MailboxPlan cmdlet to view information about mailbox plans in the cloud-based service.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-MailboxPlan [[-Identity] <MailboxPlanIdParameter>]
 [-AllMailboxPlanReleases]
 [-Credential <PSCredential>]
 [-Filter <String>]
 [-IgnoreDefaultScope]
 [-ResultSize <Unlimited>]
 [-SortBy <String>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
A mailbox plan is a template that automatically configures mailbox properties. Mailbox plans correspond to license types, and are applied when you license the user. The availability of a mailbox plan is determined by your selections when you enroll in the service and the age of your organization.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-MailboxPlan
```

This example returns a summary list of all mailbox plans in the organization.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-MailboxPlan -Identity ExchangeOnlineEnterprise | Format-List
```

This example returns detailed information for the mailbox plan that has the display name ExchangeOnlineEnterprise.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox plan that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox plan. For example:

- Name
- Alias
- Display name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

```yaml
Type: MailboxPlanIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllMailboxPlanReleases
The AllMailboxPlanReleases switch specifies whether to include mailbox plans that were used in previous versions of the service in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

If you don't use this switch, the command returns only mailbox plans that are used in the current version of the service. This parameter has meaning only for organizations that were enrolled in previous versions of the service.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.

A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter
The Filter parameter uses OPATH syntax to filter the results by the specified properties and values. The search criteria uses the syntax `"Property -ComparisonOperator 'Value'"`.

- Enclose the whole OPATH filter in double quotation marks " ". If the filter contains system values (for example, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null`), use single quotation marks ' ' instead. Although this parameter is a string (not a system block), you can also use braces { }, but only if the filter doesn't contain variables.
- Property is a filterable property. For more information about the filterable properties in Exchange server and Exchange Online, see [Filterable properties for the Filter parameter](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/filter-properties).
- ComparisonOperator is an OPATH comparison operator (for example `-eq` for equals and `-like` for string comparison). For more information about comparison operators, see [about_Comparison_Operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comparison_operators).
- Value is the property value to search for. Enclose text values and variables in single quotation marks (`'Value'` or `'$Variable'`). If a variable value contains single quotation marks, you need to identify (escape) the single quotation marks to expand the variable correctly. For example, instead of `'$User'`, use `'$($User -Replace "'","''")'`. Don't enclose integers or system values in quotation marks (for example, use `500`, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null` instead).

You can chain multiple search criteria together using the logical operators `-and` and `-or`. For example, `"Criteria1 -and Criteria2"` or `"(Criteria1 -and Criteria2) -or Criteria3"`.

For detailed information about OPATH filters in Exchange, see [Additional OPATH syntax information](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/recipient-filters#additional-opath-syntax-information).

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IgnoreDefaultScope
This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResultSize
The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SortBy
The SortBy parameter specifies the property to sort the results by. You can sort by only one property at a time. The results are sorted in ascending order.

If the default view doesn't include the property you're sorting by, you can append the command with ` | Format-Table -Auto Property1,Property2,...PropertyX`. to create a new view that contains all of the properties that you want to see. Wildcards (\*) in the property names are supported.

You can sort by the following attributes:

- Alias
- DisplayName
- Name

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
