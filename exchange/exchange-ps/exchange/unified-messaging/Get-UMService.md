# Get-UMService

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Get-UMService cmdlet to view the properties of the Microsoft Exchange Unified Messaging service on Exchange servers in your organization. This service exists on Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2013 Mailbox servers and on Exchange Server 2010 Unified Messaging servers.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-UMService [[-Identity] <UMServerIdParameter>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
When the cmdlet is used for a single Exchange server, it returns the Unified Messaging service properties, including MaxCalls, MaxFaxCalls and UMDialPlans. The properties and their values for the Exchange server are stored in the Unified Messaging section of the Exchange Server configuration object in Active Directory.

The ExchangeVersion attribute that's returned is the minimum version of Exchange you can use to manage the returned object. This attribute isn't the same as the version of Exchange that's displayed in the Exchange admin center when you select Server Configuration.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
