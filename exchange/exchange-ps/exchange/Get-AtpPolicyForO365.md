## DESCRIPTION
Safe Links is a feature in Advanced Threat Protection that checks links in email messages to see if they lead to malicious web sites. For more information, see [Office 365 ATP Safe Links](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/atp-safe-links).

ATP can also protect files in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams by preventing users from opening and downloading files that are identified as malicious. For more information, see [ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/atp-for-spo-odb-and-teams).
