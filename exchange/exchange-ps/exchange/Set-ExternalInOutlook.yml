  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowList
  description: |+
    The AllowList parameter specifies exceptions to external sender identification in supported versions of Outlook. Messages received from the specified senders or senders in the specified domains don't receive native External sender identification. The allow list uses the `5322.From` address (also known as the **From** address or P2 sender).

    Valid values are an individual domain (contoso.com), a domain and all subdomains (*.contoso.com) or email addresses (admin@contoso.com).

    To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: `Value1,Value2,...ValueN`. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

    To add or remove one or more values without affecting any existing entries, use the following syntax: `@{Add="Value1","Value2"...; Remove="Value3","Value4"...}`.

    This parameter is meaningful only when the value of the Enabled parameter is $true.

    The maximum number of entries is 50, and the total size of all entries can't exceed one kilobyte.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    The Enabled parameter enables or disables external sender identification in supported versions of Outlook. Valid values are:

    - $true: External sender identification in Outlook is enabled. An External icon is added in the area of the subject line of messages from external senders. To exempt specific senders or sender domains from this identification, use the AllowList parameter.
    - $false: External sender identification in Outlook is disabled.

    After an admin enables this setting, it can take between 24 and 48 hours for users to see the External icon in messages from external senders in supported versions of Outlook.

  If your organization already uses mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) to add text to the subject line of messages from external senders, you should disable those rules before you enable this feature to avoid duplication.
