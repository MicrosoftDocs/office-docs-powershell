### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

  Use the Set-QuarantinePermissions cmdlet to modify quarantine permissions objects that are used in quarantine tags (the New-QuarantineTag or Set-QuarantineTag cmdlets). This cmdlet only works on permissions objects that were created by the New-QuarantinePermissions cmdlet and stored in a variable that's currently available in the Windows PowerShell session.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  code: |-
    Set-QuarantinePermissions -QuarantinePermissionsObject $Perms -PermissionToRequestRelease $true -PermissionToRelease $false
  description: |-
    This example modifies the specified quarantine tag permissions in the exiting `$Perms` permissions object that was created previously in the same Windows PowerShell session (the `$Perms` variable is still available and populated).

    In the same Windows PowerShell session, you can use `$Perms` for the _EndUserQuarantinePermissions_ parameter value in a New-QuarantineTag or Set-QuarantineTag command.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
