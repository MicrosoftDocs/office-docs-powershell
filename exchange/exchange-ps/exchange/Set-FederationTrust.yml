  code: |-
    Set-FederationTrust -Identity "Azure AD Authentication" -Thumbprint AC00F35CBA8359953F4126E0984B5CCAFA2F4F17
  description: |-
    This example configures the federation trust Microsoft Federation Gateway to use the certificate with the thumbprint AC00F35CBA8359953F4126E0984B5CCAFA2F4F17 as the next certificate.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Set-FederationTrust -Identity "Azure AD Authentication" -PublishFederationCertificate
  description: |-
    This example configures the federation trust Microsoft Federation Gateway to use the next certificate as the current certificate.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    Set-FederationTrust -Identity "Azure AD Authentication" -MetadataUrl https://nexus.microsoftonline-p.com/federationmetadata/2006-12/federationmetadata.xml
  description: |-
    This example updates the configuration if the tenant is hosted in Microsoft 365 U.S. Government GCC High or DoD environment.

    Before you configure a federation trust to use the next certificate as the current certificate, you need to use the Test-FederationTrust cmdlet to verify that the certificate is available on all Exchange servers.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ApplicationUri
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The ApplicationUri parameter specifies the primary domain used for the federation organization identifier.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

    The PublishFederationCertificate switch specifies the next certificate as the current certificate for the federation trust and publishes it to the Microsoft Federation Gateway. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    The certificate is used to encrypt tokens with the Microsoft Federation Gateway.

    Before setting the next certificate to be used as the current certificate, ensure that the certificate is deployed on all Exchange servers. Use the Test-FederationCertificate cmdlet to check the deployment status of the certificate.

  defaultValue: None
