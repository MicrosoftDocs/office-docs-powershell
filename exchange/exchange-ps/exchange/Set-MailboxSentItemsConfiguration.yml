  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    The SendAsItemsCopiedTo parameter specifies where messages that are sent from the mailbox using Send As permission are saved. Valid values are:

description: |-
  By default, when you use Send As or Send On Behalf Of to send a message from another mailbox, the message is saved in your Sent Items folder (not in the Sent Items folder of the source mailbox). In Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Service Pack 3 (SP3), you can save copies messages in the Sent Items folder of the sender and the source mailbox. For example, consider a shared mailbox that receives customer feedback and is monitored by multiple users. When someone responds to a message in the shared mailbox, you can save the message in the Sent Items folder of the shared mailbox and the sender's mailbox.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
