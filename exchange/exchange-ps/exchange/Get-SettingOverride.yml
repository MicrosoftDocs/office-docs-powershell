  Setting overrides configure and store Exchange server customizations in Active Directory. The settings can be organization-wide or server-specific, and they persist in Active Directory across Exchange Cumulative Updates (CUs). Exchange customizations in web.config or exe.config XML application configuration files are server-specific, and are lost when you install the next Exchange CU.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet.
