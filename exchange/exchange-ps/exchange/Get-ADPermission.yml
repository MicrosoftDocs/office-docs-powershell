parameters:
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADRawEntryIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the identity of the object for which you're retrieving permissions. You can retrieve the permissions for any Active Directory object using its distinguished name (DN). If the object is an Exchange object, you might be able to use the object's name. If the DN or the object's name contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Owner
  description: |+
    The Owner switch returns the owner of the Active Directory object. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can't use this switch with the User parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SecurityPrincipalIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: User
  description: |+
    The user parameter filters the results who has permissions on the Active Directory object. You can specify the following types of users or groups (security principals) for this parameter:

    - Mailbox users
    - Mail users
    - Security groups

    For the best results, we recommend using the following values:

    - UPN: For example, `user@contoso.com` (users only).
    - Domain\\SamAccountName: For example, `contoso\user`.

    Otherwise, you can use any value that uniquely identifies the user or group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    You can't use this parameter with the Owner parameter.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Get-ADPermission
name: Get-ADPermission
description: |-
  The ADPermission cmdlets can be used to directly modify Active Directory access control lists (ACLs). Although some Microsoft Exchange features may continue to use the ADPermission cmdlets to manage permissions (for example Send and Receive connectors), Exchange 2013 and later versions no longer use customized ACLs to manage administrative permissions. If you want to grant or deny administrative permissions in Exchange 2013 or later, you need to use Role Based Access Control (RBAC). For more information about RBAC, see [Permissions in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions/permissions).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
