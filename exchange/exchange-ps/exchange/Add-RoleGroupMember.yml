    Add-RoleGroupMember "Recipient Management" -Member David
  description: |-
    This example adds the user David to the role group Recipient Management.

- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Get-User -Filter "Department -eq 'Sales' -and RecipientType -eq 'UserMailbox'" | Get-Mailbox | Add-RoleGroupMember "Sales and Marketing Group" -WhatIf
  description: |-
    This example finds all the mailboxes that are part of the Sales department and adds them to the Sales and Marketing Group role group. Because we're using the WhatIf switch, the changes aren't written to the role group, so you can verify that the correct members will be added.

    After you've verified that the correct members will be added to the role group, remove the WhatIf switch and run the command again.

    For more information about pipelining and the WhatIf parameter, see the following topics:

- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    Add-RoleGroupMember "Training Administrators" -Member "Training Assistants" -BypassSecurityGroupManagerCheck
  description: |-
    This example adds the Training Assistants USG to the Training Administrators role group. Because the user running the command wasn't added to the ManagedBy property of the role group, the BypassSecurityGroupManagerCheck switch must be used. The user is assigned the Role Management role, which enables the user to bypass the security group manager check.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BypassSecurityGroupManagerCheck
  description: |+
    The BypassSecurityGroupManagerCheck switch specifies whether to allow a user who isn't an owner of the group to modify or delete the group. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you aren't defined in the ManagedBy property of the group, you need to use this switch in commands that modify or delete the group. To use this switch, your account requires specific permissions based on the group type:

    - Distribution groups or mail-enabled security groups: You need to be a member of the Organization Management role group or have the Security Group Creation and Membership role assigned.
    - Role groups: You need to be a member of the Organization Management role group or have the Role Management role assigned.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SecurityPrincipalIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Member
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Member parameter specifies who you want to add to the role group. You can specify the following types of users or groups (security principals) for this parameter:

    - Mailbox users
    - Mail users
    - Mail-enabled security groups
    - Security groups (on-premises Exchange only)

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the user or group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

  parameterValueGroup: ""

  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch doesn't work in Security & Compliance PowerShell.

    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Add-RoleGroupMember
name: Add-RoleGroupMember
description: |-
  When you add a member to a role group, the member is given the effective permissions provided by the management roles assigned to the role group.

  If the ManagedBy property has been populated with role group managers, the user adding a role group member must be a role group manager. Alternately, if the user is a member of the Organization Management role group or is directly or indirectly assigned the Role Management role, the BypassSecurityGroupManagerCheck switch can be used to override the security group management check.

  In on-premises Exchange, if the role group is a linked role group, you can't use the Add-RoleGroupMember cmdlet to add members to the role group. Instead, you need to add members to the foreign universal security group (USG) that's linked to the linked role group. To find the foreign USG that's linked to a role group, use the Get-RoleGroup cmdlet.

  For more information about role groups, see [Understanding management role groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/understanding-management-role-groups-exchange-2013-help).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
