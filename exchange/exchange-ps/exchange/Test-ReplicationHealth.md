# Test-ReplicationHealth

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Test-ReplicationHealth cmdlet to check all aspects of replication and replay, or to provide status for a specific Mailbox server in a database availability group (DAG).

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Test-ReplicationHealth [[-Identity] <ServerIdParameter>] [-ActiveDirectoryTimeout <Int32>] [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-MonitoringContext <Boolean>] [-OutputObjects]
 [-TransientEventSuppressionWindow <UInt32>] [-WhatIf]
 [-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup <DatabaseAvailabilityGroupIdParameter>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Test-ReplicationHealth cmdlet is designed for the proactive monitoring of continuous replication and the continuous replication pipeline, the availability of Active Manager and the health and status of the underlying cluster service, quorum and network components. The Test-ReplicationHealth cmdlet can be run locally or remotely against any Mailbox server in a DAG.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Test-ReplicationHealth -Identity MBX1
```

This example tests the health of replication for the Mailbox server MBX1.

## PARAMETERS

### -ActiveDirectoryTimeout
The ActiveDirectoryTimeout parameter specifies the time interval in seconds that's allowed for each directory service operation before the operation times out. The default value is 15 seconds.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MonitoringContext
The MonitoringContext parameter specifies whether to include the associated monitoring events and performance counters in the results. Valid values for this parameter are $true or $false. The default value is $false. If you specify the value $true, the monitoring events and performance counters are included in the command results. Typically, you include the monitoring events and performance counters in the results when the output is passed to Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM).

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OutputObjects
The OutputObjects switch specifies whether to output an array of information regarding failures. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TransientEventSuppressionWindow
The TransientEventSuppressionWindow parameter specifies the number of minutes that the queue lengths can be exceeded before the queue length tests are considered to have failed. This parameter is used to reduce the number of failures due to transient load generation.

```yaml
Type: UInt32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the Mailbox server that you want to test. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

- Name

- FQDN

- Distinguished name (DN)

- ExchangeLegacyDN

You can't use this parameter with the DatabaseAvailabilityGroup parameter.

```yaml
Type: ServerIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DatabaseAvailabilityGroup
The DatabaseAvailabilityGroup parameter specifies whether to test all servers in the specified DAG. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the DAG. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

```yaml
Type: DatabaseAvailabilityGroupIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
