examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    Test-OutlookWebServices -Identity:holly@contoso.com
  description: |-
    This example verifies the service information that's returned to the Outlook client from the Autodiscover service for the user holly@contoso.com. The code example verifies information for the following services:

    - Availability service
    - Outlook Anywhere
    - Offline address book
    - Unified Messaging

    The example tests for a connection to each service. The example also submits a request to the Availability service for the user holly@contoso.com to determine whether the user's free/busy information is being returned correctly from the Client Access server to the Outlook client.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="ClientAccessServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AutoDiscoverServer
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The AutoDiscoverServer parameter specifies the server with the Client Access server role installed that's used for Autodiscover.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name (for example, Exchange01)
    - Distinguished name (DN) (for example, CN=Exchange01,CN=Servers,CN=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT),CN=Administrative Groups,CN=First Organization,CN=Microsoft Exchange,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=com)
    - Exchange Legacy DN (for example, /o=First Organization/ou=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=Exchange01)
    - GUID (for example, bc014a0d-1509-4ecc-b569-f077eec54942)

    You can't use this parameter with the ClientAccessServer parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ClientAccessServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ClientAccessServer
  description: |+
    This parameter is functional only in Exchange Server 2010.

    The ClientAccessServer parameter specifies the Exchange server to test. This server has the Client Access server role installed, and is responsible for accepting client connections.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - ExchangeLegacyDN
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the AutoDiscoverServer parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RecipientIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies any valid address in the forest. If you specify this parameter, incorrectly formed addresses and addresses that are outside the forest are rejected. This address is used to test the Outlook provider. This property accepts the domain and username in the domain\\username format or an Active Directory GUID and resolves them to the SMTP address that's needed to authenticate.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"

  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MailboxCredential
  description: |+
    The MailboxCredential parameter specifies the mailbox credential to use for a single mailbox test.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MonitoringContext
  description: |+
    The MonitoringContext parameter specifies whether to include the associated monitoring events and performance counters in the results. Valid values are:

    - $true: Monitoring events and performance counters are included in the command results. Typically, you include the monitoring events and performance counters in the results when the output is passed to Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM).
    - $false: Monitoring events and performance counters aren't included in the command results. This is the default value.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013

  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RecipientIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: TargetAddress
  description: |+
    The TargetAddress parameter specifies the recipient that's used to test whether Availability service data can be retrieved.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TrustAnySSLCertificate
  description: |+
    The TrustAnySSLCertificate switch allows Exchange to accept certificates from untrusted certification authorities (CAs). You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch is useful for testing internal URLs, because a URL that has an associated certificate is typically an external URL. This switch lets the task check an internal URL without generating an error when the certificate doesn't match the URL.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
