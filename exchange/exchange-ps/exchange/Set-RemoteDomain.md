# Set-RemoteDomain

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Set-RemoteDomain cmdlet to configure a managed connection for a remote domain.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## DESCRIPTION
When you set a remote domain, you can control mail flow with more precision, specify message formatting and policy and specify acceptable character sets for messages sent to or received from the remote domain.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-RemoteDomain Contoso -AllowedOOFType None -DeliveryReportEnabled $false -TNEFEnabled $true
```

This example performs the following actions:

- It disables out-of-office notifications to the remote domain.

- It suppresses delivery receipts sent from clients in your organization to the remote domain.

- It enables TNEF message data on messages sent to the remote domain.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-RemoteDomain | Where {$_.AutoReplyEnabled -eq $false} | Set-RemoteDomain -AutoForwardEnabled $false -NDREnabled $false
```

This example queries Active Directory for all remote domains for which auto replies are disabled. Using the pipelining feature, it also disables auto forwards and NDRs to those domains.

## PARAMETERS

The default value for the built-in remote domain named Default is iso-8859-1. The default value for new remote domains that you create is blank ($null).

This setting doesn't overwrite character sets that are already specified in outbound MIME messages.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False

Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ContentType
The ContentType parameter specifies the outbound message content type and formatting. Valid values are:

- MimeHtmlText: Converts messages to MIME messages that use HTML formatting, unless the original message is a text message. If the original message is a text message, the outbound message is a MIME message that uses text formatting. This is the default value.

- MimeText: Converts all messages to MIME messages that use text formatting.

- MimeHtml: Converts all messages to MIME messages that use HTML formatting.

```yaml

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DeliveryReportEnabled
The DeliveryReportEnabled parameter specifies whether to allow delivery reports from client software in your organization to recipients in the remote domain. Valid values are:

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

### -IsInternal
The IsInternal parameter specifies whether the recipients in the remote domain are considered to be internal recipients. Valid values are:

- $true: All transport components (for example, transport rules or antispam agents) treat recipients in the remote domain as internal recipients. Typically, you use this value in cross-forest deployments.

- $false: Recipients in the remote domain are treated as external recipients. This is the default value.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MessageCountThreshold

The MessageCountThreshold parameter specifies the acceptable message count for the remote domain. If the message count exceeds this value, an event is generated that's visible using the Get-ServerHealth and Get-HealthReport cmdlets.

Valid input for this parameter is an integer. The default value is Int32 (2147483647), which indicates there is no message count threshold defined, and that the message count to the remote domain is unmonitored.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

- $true: The diagnostic information of an NDR includes details that help administrators troubleshoot delivery problems. This detailed information includes internal server names. This is the default value.

- $false: The diagnostic information section in the NDR body as well as internal server headers from the attached original message headers are removed from the NDR.

This parameter is meaningful only when the value of the NDREnabled parameter is $true.

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NDREnabled

The NDREnabled parameter specifies whether to allow non-delivery reports (also known NDRs or bounce messages) from your organization to recipients in the remote domain. Valid values are:

- $true: NDRs from your organization are sent to recipients in the remote domain. This is the default value.

- $false: NDRs from your organization aren't sent to recipients in the remote domain.

```yaml

The default value for the built-in remote domain named Default is iso-8859-1. The default value for new remote domains that you create is blank ($null).

This setting doesn't overwrite character sets that are already specified in outbound plain text messages.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RequiredCharsetCoverage
The RequiredCharsetCoverage parameter specifies a percentage threshold for characters in a message that must match to apply your organization's preferred character set before switching to automatic character set detection.

For example, if you set this parameter to 60, the preferred character sets will still be used during content conversion for messages that contain characters from non-preferred character sets as long as the percentage of those characters is 40 percent or less. If the percentage of characters in a message doesn't belong to preferred character sets, Exchange analyzes the UNICODE characters and automatically determines the best matching character set to use.

If recipients in the remote domain use characters that span character sets, you might want to specify a lower percentage to ensure that your organization's preferred character set is used during content conversion.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

### -TargetDeliveryDomain

- $false: TNEF encoding isn't used on any messages sent to the remote domain.

- $null (blank): TNEF encoding isn't specified for the remote domain. This is the default value. TNEF encoding for recipients in the remote domain is controlled by the value of the UseMapiRichTextFormat parameter for any mail user or mail contact objects, the sender's per-recipient settings in Outlook, or the sender's default internet message settings in Outlook

```yaml
Type: Boolean
