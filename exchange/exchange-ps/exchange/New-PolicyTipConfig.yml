  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies the custom Policy Tip you want to modify. Valid input for this parameter is one of the following values:

    - `Locale\Action`: Locale is a supported locale code. For example, en for English or fr for French. For more information about supported locales, see [Supported languages for NDRs](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow/non-delivery-reports-and-bounce-messages/ndr-procedures#supported-languages-for-ndrs). Action is one of the following Policy Tip actions: NotifyOnly, RejectOverride or Reject.
    - Url

    There can be only one custom Policy Tip with the value Url for the Name parameter. For the remaining Policy Tip actions, there can be only one custom Policy Tip for each combination of locale and action. For example, there can be only one custom Policy Tip with the Name value en\\NotifyOnly, but you can create additional custom Policy Tips with the values de\\NotifyOnly and fr\\NotifyOnly for the Name parameter.
