# Get-ManagementRole

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-ManagementRole cmdlet to view management roles that have been created in your organization.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

 [-RoleType <RoleType>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You can view management roles in several ways, from listing all the roles in your organization to listing only the child roles of a specified parent role. You can also view the details of a specific role by piping the output of the Get-ManagementRole cmdlet to the Format-List cmdlet.

For more information about management roles, see [Understanding management roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/understanding-management-roles-exchange-2013-help).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-ManagementRole
```

This example lists all the roles that have been created in your organization.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-ManagementRole "Mail Recipients" -Recurse
```

This example lists all the roles that are children of the Mail Recipients management role. The command performs a recursive query of all the child roles of the specified parent role. This recursive query finds every child role from the immediate children of the parent to the last child role in the hierarchy. In a recursive list, the parent role is also returned in the list.

### Example 3
```powershell
Get-ManagementRole -CmdletParameters Identity, Database
```

This example lists all the roles that contain both the Identity and Database parameters. Roles that contain only one parameter or the other aren't returned.

### Example 4
```powershell
Get-ManagementRole -RoleType UnScopedTopLevel
```

This example lists all the roles that have a type of UnScopedTopLevel. These roles contain custom scripts or non-Exchange cmdlets.

### Example 5
```powershell
Get-ManagementRole "Transport Rules" | Format-List Name, RoleType
```

This example retrieves only the Transport Rules role and passes the output of the Get-ManagementRole cmdlet to the Format-List cmdlet. The Format-List cmdlet then shows only the Name and RoleType properties of the Transport Rules role. For more information about pipelining and the Format-List cmdlet, see [About Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_pipelines) and [Working with command output](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/working-with-command-output-exchange-2013-help).

### Example 6
```powershell
Get-ManagementRole "Mail Recipients" -GetChildren
```

This example lists the immediate children of the Mail Recipients role. Only the child roles that hold the Mail Recipients role as their parent role are returned. The Mail Recipients role isn't returned in the list.
