    New-ForeignConnector -Name "Contoso Foreign Connector" -AddressSpaces "X400:c=US;a=Fabrikam;P=Contoso;5" -SourceTransportServers Hub01,Hub02
  description: |-
    This example creates a Foreign connector with the following properties:

    - Connector name: Contoso Foreign Connector
    - Address space: "c=US;a=Fabrikam;P=Contoso"
    - Address space type: X.400
    - Address space cost: 5
    - Source transport servers: Hub01 and Hub02
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AddressSpaces
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The AddressSpaces parameter specifies the domain names to which the Foreign connector sends messages. The complete syntax for entering each address space is: `AddressSpaceType:AddressSpace;AddressSpaceCost`.

    - AddressSpaceType: The address space type may be SMTP, X400, or any other text string. If you omit the address space type, an SMTP address space type is assumed.
    - AddressSpace: For SMTP address space types, the address space that you enter must be RFC 1035-compliant. For example, \*, \*.com, and \*.contoso.com are permitted, but \*contoso.com isn't permitted. For X.400 address space types, the address space that you enter must be RFC 1685-compliant, such as o=MySite;p=MyOrg;a=adatum;c=us. For all other values of an address type, you can enter any text for the address space.
    - AddressSpaceCost: The valid input range for the cost is from 1 through 100. A lower cost indicates a better route. If you omit the address space cost, a cost of 1 is assumed. If you enter a non-SMTP address space that contains the semicolon character (;), you must specify the address space cost.

    If you specify the address space type or the address space cost, you must enclose the address space in quotation marks ("). For example, the following address space entries are equivalent:

    - "SMTP:contoso.com;1"
    - "contoso.com;1"
    - "SMTP:contoso.com"
    - contoso.com

    You may specify multiple address spaces by separating the address spaces with commas, for example: `contoso.com,fabrikam.com`. If you specify the address space type or the address space cost, you must enclose the address space in quotation marks ("), for example: `"contoso.com;2","fabrikam.com;3"`.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IsScopedConnector
  description: |+
    The IsScopedConnector parameter specifies the availability of the connector to other Mailbox servers. When the value of this parameter is $false, the connector can be used by all Mailbox servers in the Exchange organization. When the value of this parameter is $true, the connector can be used only by Mailbox servers in the same Active Directory site. The default value is $false.

  name: SourceTransportServers
  description: |+
    The SourceTransportServers parameter specifies the names of the Mailbox servers that use this Foreign connector. Having a single Foreign connector homed on multiple servers provides fault tolerance and high availability if one of the Mailbox servers fails. The default value of this parameter is the name of the server on which this Foreign connector is first installed.

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010

    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.New-ForeignConnector
name: New-ForeignConnector
description: |-
  A Foreign connector uses a Drop directory in the Transport service of a Mailbox server to send messages to a local messaging server that doesn't use SMTP as its primary transport mechanism. These messaging servers are known as foreign gateway servers. Third-party fax gateway servers are examples of foreign gateway servers. The address spaces assigned to a Foreign connector can be SMTP or non-SMTP.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
