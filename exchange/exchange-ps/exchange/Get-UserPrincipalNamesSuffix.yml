description: |-
  UPN suffixes assigned to an organizational unit are stored in the upnSuffixes attribute in the Organizational Unit object.

  The default UPN is contained in the Canonical Name attribute on the Partitions container object in the configuration naming context. The default UPN suffix identifies the domain in which the user account is contained. When you create a user account in Active Directory, the default UPN suffix is the DNS name of the first domain in your domain tree.

  If you create user accounts by using Active Directory Users and Computers, every user must have a UPN.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
