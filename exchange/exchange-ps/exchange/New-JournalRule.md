# New-JournalRule

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the New-JournalRule cmdlet to create a journal rule in your organization.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
New-JournalRule -Name <String> -JournalEmailAddress <RecipientIdParameter> [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-Enabled <Boolean>]
 [-Recipient <SmtpAddress>]
 [-Scope <JournalRuleScope>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The New-JournalRule cmdlet creates a journal rule in your organization.

By default, new journal rules are disabled unless the Enabled parameter is set to $true. For more information about how to enable a new journal rule that was created in a disabled state, see [Enable-JournalRule](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/enable-journalrule).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
New-JournalRule -Name "Brokerage Communications" -JournalEmailAddress "Brokers Journal Mailbox" -Scope Global -Recipient brokers@contoso.com -Enabled $true
```

This example creates and enables a journal rule. The rule applies to all email messages that pass through the Transport service and contain at least one recipient or sender who is a member of the brokers@contoso.com distribution list.

## PARAMETERS

### -Name
The Name parameter specifies the name of the journal rule. The name of the rule can be up to 64 characters long.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -JournalEmailAddress
The JournalEmailAddress parameter specifies a recipient object to which journal reports are sent. You ean use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

- Name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- Email address

- GUID

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

```

### -Enabled
The Enabled parameter specifies whether the journal rule is enabled or disabled. If the rule is disabled, it isn't applied to any email messages. The default value is $false.

```yaml
Type: Boolean

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Recipient

```yaml

```

### -Scope
The Scope parameter specifies the scope of email messages to which the journal rule is applied. Valid values for this parameter are as follows:

Required: False

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

```yaml
