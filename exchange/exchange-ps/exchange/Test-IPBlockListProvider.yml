parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

- type: <xref href="IPBlockListProviderIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the IP Block list provider that you want to test. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the IP Block list provider. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="IPAddress" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IPAddress
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The IPAddress parameter specifies an IP address to be used in testing the IP Block list provider. You need to use a known blocked IP address.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016

- type: <xref href="ServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    The Server parameter specifies the Exchange server where you want to run this command. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Exchange Legacy DN

    If you don't use this parameter, the command is run on the local server.

    You can't use this parameter to configure other Edge Transport servers remotely.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
