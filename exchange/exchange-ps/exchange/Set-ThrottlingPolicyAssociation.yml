### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Set-ThrottlingPolicyAssociation cmdlet to associate a throttling policy with a specific object. The object can be a user with a mailbox, a user without a mailbox, a contact, or a computer account.

  **Note**: Some parameters in the throttling policy (for example, MessageRateLimit) apply only to objects that have mailbox GUIDs (mailboxes or remote mailboxes) and don't apply to mail users. And, if you want to apply throttling policy to a remote mailbox, first populate the remote mailbox with an ExchangeGUID by using Set-RemoteMailbox -ExchangeGUID.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  code: |-
    Set-ThrottlingPolicyAssociation -Identity tonysmith -ThrottlingPolicy ITStaffPolicy
  description: |-
    This example associates a user with a username of tonysmith to the throttling policy ITStaffPolicy that has higher limits.

  code: |-
    $b = Get-ThrottlingPolicy ITStaffPolicy

    Set-Mailbox -Identity tonysmith -ThrottlingPolicy $b
  description: |-
    You don't need to use the Set-ThrottlingPolicyAssociation cmdlet to associate a user with a policy. The following commands show another way to associate tonysmith with the throttling policy ITStaffPolicy.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

  name: Identity

name: Set-ThrottlingPolicyAssociation
description: |-
  The Set-ThrottlingPolicyAssociation cmdlet defines quota limits for specific objects. For example, if you notice that a user or other object is using excessive bandwidth, you can associate that object with a throttling policy that's more restrictive.

  In data center deployments, the object referred to by the Identity and ThrottlingPolicy parameters must be in the same tenant.

  For more information about how to control the resources consumed by individual users, see [User workload management in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/server-health/workload-management).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run the Set-ThrottlingPolicyAssociation cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
