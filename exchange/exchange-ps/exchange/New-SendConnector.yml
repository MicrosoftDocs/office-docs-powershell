examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    New-SendConnector -Internet -Name MySendConnector -AddressSpaces contoso.com,fabrikam.com
  description: |-
    This example creates the Send connector named MySendConnector with the following properties:

    - It sends email messages over the Internet.
    - It processes messages addressed only to Contoso.com and Fabrikam.com domains.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    $CredentialObject = Get-Credential

    New-SendConnector -Name "Secure Email to Contoso.com" -AddressSpaces contoso.com -AuthenticationCredential $CredentialObject -SmartHostAuthMechanism BasicAuth
  description: |-
    This example creates the Send connector Secure Email to Contoso.com with the following properties:

    - It processes messages only for the Contoso.com domain.
    - It uses Basic authentication.
    - It uses a specific authentication credential.

    To assign a specific authentication credential for the Send connector, you must first run the Get-Credential command and store the user input in a temporary variable. When you run the Get-Credential command, the command asks for the username and password of the account used during authentication with the Contoso.com email server. The temporary variable can then be used in the New-SendConnector cmdlet to create the new connector.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AddressSpaces
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The AddressSpaces parameter specifies the domain names to which the Send connector routes mail. The complete syntax for entering each address space is: `AddressSpaceType:AddressSpace;AddressSpaceCost`.

    - AddressSpaceType: On an Edge server, the address space type must be SMTP. In the Transport service on a Mailbox server, the address space type may be SMTP, X400, or any other text string. If you omit the address space type, SMTP is assumed.
    - AddressSpace: For SMTP address space types, the address space that you enter must be RFC 1035-compliant. For example, \*, \*.com, and \*.contoso.com are permitted, but \*contoso.com is not. For X.400 address space types, the address space that you enter must be RFC 1685-compliant, such as o=MySite;p=MyOrg;a=adatum;c=us. For all other values of address space type, you can enter any text for the address space.
    - AddressSpaceCost: The valid input range for the cost is from 1 through 100. A lower cost indicates a better route. This parameter is optional. If you omit the address space cost, a cost of 1 is assumed. If you enter a non-SMTP address space that contains the semicolon character (;), you must specify the address space cost.

    If you specify the address space type or the address space cost, you must enclose the address space in quotation marks ("). For example, the following address space entries are equivalent:

    - "SMTP:contoso.com;1"
    - "contoso.com;1"
    - "SMTP:contoso.com"
    - contoso.com

    You may specify multiple address spaces by separating the address spaces with commas, for example: contoso.com,fabrikam.com. If you specify the address space type or the address space cost, enclose the address space in quotation marks ("), for example: "contoso.com;2","fabrikam.com;3".

    If you specify a non-SMTP address space type on a Send connector configured in the Transport service on a Mailbox server, you must configure the following parameters:

    - The SmartHosts parameter must be set to a value that specifies a smart host.
    - The DNSRoutingEnabled parameter must be set to $false.

    Although you can configure non-SMTP address spaces on a Send connector in the Transport service on a Mailbox server, the Send connector uses SMTP as the transport mechanism to send messages to other messaging servers. Foreign connectors in the Transport service on a Mailbox server are used to send messages to local messaging servers, such as third-party fax gateway servers, which don't use SMTP as their primary transport mechanism. For more information, see [Foreign connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/foreign-connectors-exchange-2013-help).

  name: AuthenticationCredential
  description: |+
    The AuthenticationCredential parameter specifies the username and password that's required to use the connector.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter.

  name: CloudServicesMailEnabled
  description: |+
    **Note**: We recommend that you don't use this parameter unless you are directed to do so by Microsoft Customer Service and Support, or by specific product documentation. Instead, use the Hybrid Configuration wizard to configure mail flow between your on-premises and cloud organizations. For more information, see [Hybrid Configuration wizard](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/hybrid-configuration-wizard).

    The CloudServicesMailEnabled parameter specifies whether the connector is used for hybrid mail flow between an on-premises Exchange environment and Microsoft 365. Specifically, this parameter controls how certain internal X-MS-Exchange-Organization-\* message headers are handled in messages that are sent between accepted domains in the on-premises and cloud organizations. These headers are collectively known as cross-premises headers.

    Valid values are:

    - $true: The connector is used for mail flow in hybrid organizations, so cross-premises headers are preserved or promoted in messages that flow through the connector. This is the default value for connectors that are created by the Hybrid Configuration wizard. Certain X-MS-Exchange-Organization-\* headers in outbound messages that are sent from one side of the hybrid organization to the other are converted to X-MS-Exchange-CrossPremises-\* headers and are thereby preserved in messages. X-MS-Exchange-CrossPremises-\* headers in inbound messages that are received on one side of the hybrid organization from the other are promoted to X-MS-Exchange-Organization-\* headers. These promoted headers replace any instances of the same X-MS-Exchange-Organization-\* headers that already exist in messages.
    - $false: The connector isn't used for mail flow in hybrid organizations, so any cross-premises headers are removed from messages that flow through the connector.

  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainSecureEnabled
  description: |+
    The DomainSecureEnabled parameter enables mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication for the domains serviced by the Send connector when set to $true. Mutual TLS authentication functions correctly only if the following conditions are met:

    - DomainSecureEnabled is set to $true.
    - DNSRoutingEnabled is set to $true.
    - IgnoreSTARTTLS is set to $false.

    The wildcard character (\*) isn't supported in domains configured for mutual TLS authentication. The same domain must also be defined on the corresponding Receive connector, and in the value of the TLSReceiveDomainSecureList attribute of the transport configuration.

    The default value for the DomainSecureEnabled parameter is $false for the following types of Send connectors:

    - Those defined in the Transport service on a Mailbox server.
    - User-created Send connectors defined on an Edge server.

    The default value is $true for a default Send connector defined on an Edge server.

  name: Fqdn
  description: |+
    The Fqdn parameter specifies the FQDN used as the source server for connected messaging servers that use the Send connector to receive outgoing messages. The value of this parameter is displayed to connected messaging servers whenever a source server name is required, as in the following examples:

    - In the EHLO/HELO command when the Send connector communicates with the next hop messaging server
    - In the most recent Received header field added to the message by the next hop messaging server after the message leaves the Transport service on a Mailbox server or an Edge server
    - During TLS authentication

    The default value of the Fqdn parameter is $null. This means the default FQDN value is the FQDN of the Mailbox server or Edge server that contains the Send connector.

  name: SmartHosts
  description: |+
    The SmartHosts parameter specifies the smart hosts the Send connector uses to route mail. This parameter is required if you set the DNSRoutingEnabled parameter to $false and it must be specified on the same command line. The SmartHosts parameter takes one or more FQDNs, such as server.contoso.com, or one or more IP addresses, or a combination of both FQDNs and IP addresses. If you enter an IP address, you must enter the IP address as a literal. For example, 10.10.1.1. The smart host identity can be the FQDN of a smart-host server, a mail exchanger (MX) record, or an address (A) record. If you configure an FQDN as the smart host identity, the source server for the Send connector must be able to use DNS name resolution to locate the smart host server.

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

  name: TlsAuthLevel
  description: |+
    The TlsAuthLevel parameter specifies the TLS authentication level that is used for outbound TLS connections established by this Send connector. Valid values are:

    - EncryptionOnly: TLS is used only to encrypt the communication channel. No certificate authentication is performed.
    - CertificateValidation: TLS is used to encrypt the channel and certificate chain validation and revocation lists checks are performed.
    - DomainValidation: In addition to channel encryption and certificate validation, the Send connector also verifies that the FQDN of the target certificate matches the domain specified in the TlsDomain parameter. If no domain is specified in the TlsDomain parameter, the FQDN on the certificate is compared with the recipient's domain.

    You can't specify a value for this parameter if the IgnoreSTARTTLS parameter is set to $true, or if the RequireTLS parameter is set to $false.

  description: |+
    The TlsCertificateName parameter specifies the X.509 certificate to use for TLS encryption. A valid value for this parameter is `"<I>X.500Issuer<S>X.500Subject"`. The X.500Issuer value is found in the certificate's Issuer field, and the X.500Subject value is found in the certificate's Subject field. You can find these values by running the Get-ExchangeCertificate cmdlet. Or, after you run Get-ExchangeCertificate to find the thumbprint value of the certificate, run the command `$TLSCert = Get-ExchangeCertificate -Thumbprint <Thumbprint>`, run the command `$TLSCertName = "<I>$($TLSCert.Issuer)<S>$($TLSCert.Subject)"`, and then use the value $TLSCertName for this parameter.
