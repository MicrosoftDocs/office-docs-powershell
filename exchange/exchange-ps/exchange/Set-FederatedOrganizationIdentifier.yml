parameters:
- type: <xref href="SmtpDomain" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AccountNamespace
  description: |+
    The AccountNamespace parameter specifies the federated domain to be used to establish the organization identifier with the Microsoft Federation Gateway.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SmtpDomain" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DefaultDomain
  description: |+
    The DefaultDomain parameter specifies the federated domain used for delegation tokens issued by the Microsoft Federation Gateway for user accounts in the Exchange organization. If the DefaultDomain parameter isn't set, the primary SMTP domain for each user account is used in delegation tokens issued by the Microsoft Federation Gateway. Only a single domain or subdomain for the Exchange organization should be configured, and it applies to all delegation tokens issued for the Exchange organization, for example, contoso.com.

    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Set-FederatedOrganizationIdentifier
name: Set-FederatedOrganizationIdentifier
description: |-
  You must configure a federated organization identifier to create an account namespace for your Exchange organization with the Microsoft Federation Gateway and enable federation for the purpose of sharing calendars or contacts, accessing free/busy information across Exchange organizations and securing cross-premises email delivery using federated delivery. When you create a federation trust, a value for the AccountNamespace parameter is automatically created with the Microsoft Federation Gateway. The AccountNamespace parameter is a combination of a pre-defined string and the domain specified. For example, if you specify the federated domain contoso.com as the domain, "FYDIBOHF25SPDLT.contoso.com" is automatically created as the value for the AccountNamespace parameter. You can add and remove Additional domain names later by using the Add-FederatedDomain and Remove-FederatedDomain cmdlets.

  You can temporarily disable federation by disabling the organization identifier.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
