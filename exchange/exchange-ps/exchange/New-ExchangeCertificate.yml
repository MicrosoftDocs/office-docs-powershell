- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    New-ExchangeCertificate
  description: |-
    This example creates a self-signed certificate with the following settings:

    - The Subject value is `CN=<ServerName>` (for example, CN=Mailbox01).
    - The Domains (subject alternative names) value is `<ServerName>,<ServerFQDN>` (for example, `Mailbox01,Mailbox01.contoso.com`).
    - The Services value is `IMAP,POP,SMTP`.
    - The Services value SMTP grants the Network Services local security group read access to the certificate's private key.
    - The Services value SMTP and the Subject value that contains the server name publishes the certificate to Active Directory so that Exchange direct trust can validate the authenticity of the server for mutual TLS.

    If you don't want this certificate to replace the existing self-signed certificate that was created during Exchange setup, be sure to select "No" in the prompt that asks you overwrite the existing default SMTP certificate.

  code: |-
    Get-ExchangeCertificate -Thumbprint c4248cd7065c87cb942d60f7293feb7d533a4afc | New-ExchangeCertificate -PrivateKeyExportable $true
  description: |-
    This example shows how to renew a certificate with a specific thumbprint value. You can find the thumbprint value in one of two ways:

    - Select the certificate in the Exchange admin center and then select Edit to view properties of the certificate. The thumbprint value is shown in the Exchange Certificate window.
    - Run the Get-ExchangeCertificate cmdlet to return a list of all certificates installed on the server with their thumbprint values.

    Setting the PrivateKeyExportable parameter to the value $true allows the renewed certificate to be exported from the server (and imported on other servers).

  description: |-
    In **Exchange 2013**, this example creates a new certificate request for a certification authority that has the following settings:

    - The request is Base64 encoded.
    - The Subject value is `c=US,o=Woodgrove Bank,cn=mail.woodgrovebank.com`.
    - The Domains (subject alternative names) value contains the additional valuesautodiscover.woodgrovebank.com, mail.fabrikam.com, and autodiscover.fabrikam.com.
    - The command output is displayed onscreen and is also written to the text file C:\\Cert Requests\\woodgrovebank.req.

    **Note**: The RequestFile parameter is available only in Exchange 2013. To create a new certificate request file in Exchange 2016 or Exchange 2019, see Example 4 and Example 5.

    After you create the certificate request, you send the output to the CA. After you receive the certificate from the CA, you install the certificate by using the Import-ExchangeCertificate cmdlet, and you assign the certificate to Exchange services by using the Enable-ExchangeCertificate cmdlet.

    If the CA requires the certificate request in a file that's encoded by DER, use the BinaryEncoding switch and save the file with the .pfx extension.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BinaryEncoded
  description: |+
    The BinaryEncoded switch specifies whether to encode the new certificate request by using Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER). You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you don't use this switch, the request is Base64 encoded.

    This switch is available only when you use the GenerateRequest switch.

    For Base64 encoded requests, you send the contents of the file to the certificate authority. For requests that are encoded by DER, you send the certificate file itself.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

  name: DomainName
  description: |+
    The DomainName parameter specifies one or more FQDNs or server names for theSubject Alternative Name field (also known as the Subject Alt Name or SAN field) of the certificate request or self-signed certificate.

    If the value in the certificate's Subject field doesn't match the destination server name or FQDN, the requestor looks for a match in the Subject Alternative Name field.

    Typically, values include server names (for example, Mailbox01) and FQDNs (for example, mail.contoso.com). You can specify multiple values separated by commas. Valuescan contain the characters a through z, 0 through 9, and the hyphen (-). The length of the domain name can't exceed 255 characters.

    The default value includes the name and FQDN of the Exchange server when both of the following conditions are true:

    - You don't use this parameter.
    - You don't use any of these parameters: IncludeAcceptedDomains, IncludeAutoDiscover, IncludeServerFQDN, or IncludeServerNetBIOSName.

  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    By default, when you create a self-signed certificate that's enabled for SMTP (no Services parameter, or the Services parameter contains the value SMTP), you're prompted to replace the existing default SMTP certificate with the new one that you're creating. If you use the Force switch, the new SMTP certificate automatically replaces the existing SMTP certificate without asking.

  name: FriendlyName
  description: |+
    The FriendlyName parameter specifies a friendly name for the certificate request or self-signed certificate. The value must be less than 64 characters.

    The default value is Microsoft Exchange. The friendly name value is descriptive text, and doesn't affect the functionality of the certificate.

  name: GenerateRequest
  description: |+
    The GenerateRequest switch specifies that you're creating a certificate request for a certification authority (CA). You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    Using this switch and exporting the output to a file generates a PKCS #10 certificate request that you send to the CA. How you send the information depends on the CA, but typically, for Base64 encoded requests, you paste the contents in an email message or in the request form on the CA's web site.

    After you install the certificate from the certification authority by using the Import-ExchangeCertificate cmdlet, you use the Enable-ExchangeCertficate cmdlet to enable the certificate for Exchange services.

    If you don't use this switch, the command creates a new self-signed certificate on the Exchange server.

  name: IncludeAcceptedDomains
  description: |+
    The IncludeAcceptedDomains switch specifies that all accepted domains in the Exchange organization are included in the Subject Alternative Name field of the certificate request or self-signed certificate. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    When you use this switch:

    - If you've already included an accepted domain in the DomainName parameter, the value isn't duplicated in the Subject Alternative Name field.
    - For new self-signed certificates, if you don't use the Services parameter, the certificate is only assigned to SMTP.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeAutoDiscover
  description: |+
    The IncludeAutoDiscover switch specifies whether to add a Subject Alternative Namevalue with the prefix autodiscover for each accepted domain in the Exchange organization. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    For example, if the organization has the accepted domains woodgrovebank.com and woodgrovebank.co.uk, using this switch results in the addition of the following values in the Subject Alternative Name field:

    - autodiscover.woodgrovebank.com
    - autodiscover.woodgrovebank.co.uk

    When you use this switch:

    - If you've already included the value `autodiscover.<AcceptedDomain>` in the DomainName parameter, the value isn't duplicated in the Subject Alternative Name field.
    - For new self-signed certificates, if you don't use the Services parameter, the certificate is only assigned to SMTP.

    The IncludeServerFQDN switch specifies that the FQDN of the Exchange server is included in the Subject Alternative Name field of the new certificate request or self-signed certificate. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    When you use this switch, and you've already included the server's FQDN in the DomainName parameter, the value isn't duplicated in the Subject Alternative Name field.

  name: PrivateKeyExportable
  description: |+
    The PrivateKeyExportable parameter specifies whether the certificate has an exportable private key, and controls whether you can export the certificate from the server (and import the certificate on other servers). Valid values are:

    - $true: The private key is exportable, so you can export the certificate from the server.
    - $false: The private key isn't exportable, so you can't export the certificate. This is the default value.

  name: RequestFile
  description: |+
    **Note**: This parameter was removed from Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019 by the [2022 H1 Cumulative Updates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/released-2022-h1-cumulative-updates-for-exchange-server/ba-p/3285026) because it accepts UNC path values. To export the certificate request to a file without using the RequestFile parameter, see Example 4 and Example 5 (new) or Example 7 and Example 8 (renew).

    This parameter is available only in Exchange 2013.

    The RequestFile parameter specifies the name and path of the certificate request file. The file contains the same information that's displayed on-screen when you generate a Base64 encoded certificate request (you don't use the BinaryEncoded switch).

    You can use a local path if the certificate or certificate request is located on the same Exchange server where you're running the command. Otherwise, use a UNC path (`\\Server\Share`). If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

    You can use this parameter only when you use the GenerateRequest switch.

    The Server parameter specifies the Exchange server where you want to run this command. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Exchange Legacy DN

    If you don't use this parameter, the command is run on the local server.

  name: Services
  description: |+
    The Services parameter specifies the Exchange services that the new self-signed certificate is enabled for. Valid values are:

    - None: You can enable the certificate for Exchange services later by using the Enable-ExchangeCertificate cmdlet.
    - Federation
    - IIS
    - IMAP: Don't enable a wildcard certificate for the IMAP4 service. Instead, use the Set-ImapSettings cmdlet to configure the FQDN that clients use to connect to the IMAP4 service.
    - POP: Don't enable a wildcard certificate for the POP3 service. Instead, use the Set-PopSettings cmdlet to configure the FQDN that clients use to connect to the POP3 service.
    - SMTP: When you enable a certificate for SMTP, you're prompted to replace the default Exchange self-signed certificate that's used to encrypt SMTP traffic between internal Exchange. If you want to replace the default certificate without the confirmation prompt, use the Force switch.
    - UM: This value requires that the UMStartupMode parameter on the Set-UMService cmdlet is set to TLS or Dual. If the UMStartupMode parameter is set to the default value of TCP, you can't enable the certificate for the UM service.
    - UMCallRouter: This value requires that the UMStartupMode parameter on the Set-UMCallRouterService cmdlet is set to TLS or Dual. If the UMStartupMode parameter is set to the default value TCP, you can't enable the certificate for the UM Call Router service.

    You can specify multiple values separated by commas. The default values are IMAP, POP, and SMTP.

    You can't use this parameter with the GenerateRequest switch.

    Once you enable a certificate for a service, you can't remove the service from the certificate.

  name: SubjectName
  description: |+
    The SubjectName parameter specifies the Subject field of the certificate request or self-signed certificate.

    Every certificate requires a value for the Subject field, and only one value is allowed. The requestor attempts to match the destination server name or FQDN with the common name (CN) value of subject.

    This parameter uses the syntax: `[C=CountryOrRegion,S=StateOrProvince,L=LocalityOrCity,O=Organization,OU=Department],CN=HostNameOrFQDN`. Although the only required value is `CN=HostNameOrFQDN`, you should always include `C=CountryOrRegion` for certificate requests, but other values might also be required by the certification authority.

    For example, if you want the certificate's subject to be mail.contoso.com in the United States, you can use any of the following values:

    - C=US,S=WA,L=Redmond,O=Contoso,OU=IT,CN=mail.contoso.com
    - C=US,O=Contoso,CN=mail.contoso.com
    - C=US,CN=mail.contoso.com

    If you don't use this parameter, the default value is the name of the Exchange server where you run the command (for example, CN=Mailbox01).

    For a subject alternative name (SAN) certificate, you should choose one of the values from the DomainName parameter to use in the SubjectName value. In fact, the CN value that you specify for SubjectName is automatically included in the DomainName values.

    For a wildcard certificate, use a SubjectName value that contains the wildcard character (\*). For example, C=US,CN=\*.contoso.com.

  Exchange uses certificates for SSL and TLS encryption.

  There are many factors to consider when you configure certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) services. You need to understand how these factors might affect your overall configuration. For more information, see [Digital certificates and encryption in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/architecture/client-access/certificates).

  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is being replaced by Transport Layer Security (TLS) as the protocol that's used to encrypt data sent between computer systems. They're so closely related that the terms "SSL" and "TLS" (without versions) are often used interchangeably. Because of this similarity, references to "SSL" in Exchange topics, the Exchange admin center, and the Exchange Management Shell have often been used to encompass both the SSL and TLS protocols. Typically, "SSL" refers to the actual SSL protocol only when a version is also provided (for example, SSL 3.0). To find out why you should disable the SSL protocol and switch to TLS, check out [Protecting you against the SSL 3.0 vulnerability](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/protecting-against-the-ssl-3-0-vulnerability/).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
