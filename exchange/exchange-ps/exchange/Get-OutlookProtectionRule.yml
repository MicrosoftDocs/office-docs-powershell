  Outlook protection rules are used to automatically Information Rights Management (IRM)-protect email messages using a Rights Management Services (RMS) template before the message is sent. However, Outlook protection rules don't inspect message content. To IRM-protect messages based on message content, use transport protection rules. For more information, see [Outlook protection rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/outlook-protection-rules-exchange-2013-help).
