# Get-UMCallDataRecord

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-UMCallDataRecord cmdlet to display Unified Messaging (UM) call data records for a specific UM-enabled user's mailbox.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-UMCallDataRecord -Mailbox <MailboxIdParameter> [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-UMCallDataRecord cmdlet displays UM call data records for the last 90 days for a UM-enabled mailbox that you specify. Each UM call data record provides detailed information about all calls either placed to or received by the specified user. The following list details each of the properties that are returned:

- Date: Date and time of the Mailbox server running the Microsoft Exchange Unified Messaging service that took the call in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format.

- Duration: Total duration of this call. For Find Me calls, this will always be zero because the call is being transferred and won't be handled by Unified Messaging any longer.

- AudioCodec: Audio codec used for the call including G.711 or Group System Mobile (GSM).

- DialPlan: Name of the UM dial plan handling the call.

- CallType: Type of the call (localized in the user's language): Call Answering Voice Message, Call Answering Missed Call, , Auto Attendant, Subscriber Access, Fax, PlayOnPhone, Find Me, None, UnauthenticatedPilotNumber, or PromptProvisioning.

- CallingNumber: Phone number or address of the caller.

- CalledNumber: Phone number or address of the intended recipient of the call.

- Gateway: Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the UM IP gateway handling the call.

- Network MOS (NMOS): Mean opinion score for the network performance.

- NMOSDegradation: Total NMOS degradation, which is how far the NMOS reported value was from its top value for the corresponding audio codec.

- PercentagePacketLoss: Percentage that reflects the average network packet loss during the call.

- Jitter: Average jitter of the network.

- RoundTripMilliseconds: Round trip time for Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) statistics in milliseconds.

- BurstLossDurationMilliseconds: Average duration of packet loss during bursts during the call.
