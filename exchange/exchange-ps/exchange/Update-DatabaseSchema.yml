### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Update-DatabaseSchema cmdlet to upgrade the database schema for one or more databases after an Exchange software update that includes database schema updates has been installed on Mailbox servers in a database availability group (DAG). Some software updates for Exchange may include database schema updates. After such an update has been installed on all members of a DAG, the administrator must run the Update-DatabaseSchema cmdlet for each database in the DAG and dismount/mount or failover the database to trigger the database schema update. The in-place database schema upgrade engine ensures that no schema updates occur until all members of the DAG have compatible versions of the software.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
