  description: |-
    This example configures the following settings in the outbound spam filter policy named Default:

    - The recipient rate limits are restricted to smaller values that the service defaults.
    - After one of the limits is reached, the user is prevented from sending messages (added to the Restricted Users portal).
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="OutboundRecipientLimitsExceededAction" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ActionWhenThresholdReached
  description: |+
    The ActionWhenThresholdReach parameter specifies the action to take when any of the limits specified in the policy are reached. Valid values are:

    - Alert: No action, alert only.
    - BlockUser: Prevent the user from sending email messages.
    - BlockUserForToday: Prevent the user from sending email messages until the following day. This is the default value.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: Alert, BlockUserForToday, BlockUser
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AdminDisplayName
  description: |+
    The AdminDisplayName parameter specifies a description for the policy. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="AutoForwardingMode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AutoForwardingMode
  description: |+
    The AutoForwardingMode specifies how the policy controls automatic email forwarding to external recipients. Valid values are:

    - Automatic: This is the default value. This setting is now the same as Off. When this setting was originally introduced, this value was equivalent to On. Over time, thanks to the principles of [secure by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/secure-by-default), this value was gradually changed to the equivalent of Off for all customers. For more information, see [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-automatic-email-forwarding-in/ba-p/2074888).
    - On: Automatic external email forwarding is not restricted.
    - Off: Automatic external email forwarding is disabled and will result in a non-delivery report (also known as an NDR or bounce message) to the sender.

    This setting applies only to cloud-based mailboxes, and automatic forwarding to internal recipients is not affected by this setting.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: Automatic, Off, On
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BccSuspiciousOutboundAdditionalRecipients
  description: |+
    The BccSuspiciousOutboundAdditionalRecipients parameter specifies an email address to add to the Bcc field of outgoing spam messages. You can specify multiple email addresses separated by commas.

    The specified recipients are added to the Bcc field of outgoing spam messages when the value of the BccSuspiciousOutboundMail parameter is $true.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BccSuspiciousOutboundMail
  description: |+
    The BccSuspiciousOutboundMail parameter specifies whether to add recipients to the Bcc field of outgoing spam messages. Valid values are:

    - $true: The recipients specified by the BccSuspiciousOutboundAdditionalRecipients parameter are added to outgoing spam messages.
    - $false: No additional messages are added to outgoing spam messages. This is the default value.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the outbound spam filter policy you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    **Note**: This setting has been replaced by the default alert policy named **User restricted from sending email**, which sends notification messages to admins. We recommend that you use the alert policy rather than this setting to notify admins and other users. For instructions, see [Verify the alert settings for restricted users](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/removing-user-from-restricted-users-portal-after-spam#verify-the-alert-settings-for-restricted-users).

    The NotifyOutboundSpam parameter specify whether to notify admins when outgoing spam is detected. Valid values are:

    - $true: Notify the admins specified by the NotifyOutboundSpamRecipients parameter.
    - $false: Don't send notifications. This is the default value.
