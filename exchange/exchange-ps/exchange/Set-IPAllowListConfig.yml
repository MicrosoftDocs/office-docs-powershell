  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

  name: ExternalMailEnabled
  description: |+
    The ExternalMailEnabled parameter specifies whether messages from connections outside of the Exchange organization are evaluated by the IP Allow list. Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false. The default value is $true. By default, messages from external connections are evaluated by the IP Allow list.

  description: |+
    The InternalMailEnabled parameter specifies whether messages from connections inside the Exchange organization are evaluated by the IP Allow list. Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false. The default value is $false. By default, messages from internal connections are not evaluated by the IP Allow list.
