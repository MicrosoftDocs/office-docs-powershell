    Set-RetentionPolicy "MyPolicy" -RetentionPolicyTagLinks "MyRetentionPolicyTag"
  description: |-
    This example modifies the policy MyPolicy to link the retention policy tag MyRetentionPolicyTag with it.

    The Identity parameter is a positional parameter. Positional parameters can be used without the label (Identity). For more information about positional parameters, see [About Parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_parameters).
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    Use this switch to hide the confirmation prompt when you use the RetentionId parameter.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxPolicyIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the name, distinguished name (DN), or GUID of the retention policy.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IsDefault
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The IsDefault switch specifies that this retention policy is the default retention policy. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    When you use this switch, you'll get a warning that this retention policy will replace the current default retention policy (the policy where the IsDefault property value is currently True) as the default. By default, the default retention policy is named Default MRM Policy.

    **Note**: Changing which retention policy is the default might or might not affect new and existing mailboxes based on the value of the RetentionPolicy parameter on all mailbox plans:

    - $null (blank): Changes to which retention policy is the default are continually reflected in new and existing mailboxes.
    - A retention policy is specified: The value of the RetentionPolicy parameter for all mailbox plans should be $null (blank) or match the Exchange retention policy that's configured as the default policy for the organization. Otherwise, the experience might be inconsistent when creating new mailboxes, enabling disabled mailboxes, and changing licenses. For more information see [Mailbox plans in Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-user-mailboxes/mailbox-plans).

    If a mailbox is assigned an Exchange retention policy that's not the default policy, the RetentionPolicy value of the mailbox will be overwritten when changing licenses and will need to be manually reset to the original value.

    Changes to the default retention policy that affect existing mailboxes can potentially saturate the network if there are hundreds or thousands of mailboxes that require updates.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IsDefaultArbitrationMailbox
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The IsDefaultArbitrationMailbox switch configures this policy as the default retention policy for arbitration mailboxes in your Exchange Online organization. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This parameter isn't available in on-premises deployments.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the retention policy.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RetentionId
  description: |+
    The RetentionId parameter specifies the identity of the retention policy to make sure mailboxes moved between two Exchange organizations continue to have the same retention policy applied to them. For example, in a cross-forest deployment or in a cross-premises deployment, when a mailbox is moved from an on-premises Exchange server to the cloud, or a cloud-based mailbox is moved to an on-premises Exchange server, this parameter is used to make sure the same retention policy is applied to the mailbox.

    It's not normally required to specify or modify the RetentionId parameter for a retention tag. The parameter is populated automatically when importing retention tags using the Import-RetentionTags.ps1 script.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RetentionPolicyTagIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: RetentionPolicyTagLinks
  description: |+
    The RetentionPolicyTagLinks parameter specifies the identity of retention policy tags to associate with the retention policy. Mailboxes that get a retention policy applied have retention tags linked with that retention policy.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
