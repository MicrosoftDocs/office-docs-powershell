## DESCRIPTION
The New-MigrationEndpoint cmdlet configures the connection settings for different types of migrations:

- Cross-forest move: Move mailboxes between two different on-premises Exchange forests. Cross-forest moves require the use of a Remote Move endpoint.

- Remote move migration: In a hybrid deployment, a remote move migration involves onboarding or offboarding migrations. Remote move migrations also require the use of an Exchange remote move endpoint. Onboarding moves mailboxes from an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online, and uses a remote move endpoint as the source endpoint of the migration batch. Offboarding moves mailboxes from Exchange Online to an on-premises Exchange organization and uses a remote move endpoint as the target endpoint of the migration batch.

- Cutover Exchange migration: Migrate all mailboxes in an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online. A cutover Exchange migration requires the use of an Outlook Anywhere migration endpoint.

- Staged Exchange migration: Migrate a subset of mailboxes from an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online. A staged Exchange migration requires the use of an Outlook Anywhere migration endpoint.

- IMAP migration: Migrate mailbox data from an on-premises Exchange organization or other email system to Exchange Online. For an IMAP migration, you must first create the cloud-based mailboxes before you migrate mailbox data. IMAP migrations require the use of an IMAP endpoint.

- G Suite migration: Migration mailbox data from a G Suite tenant to Exchange Online.  For a G Suite migration, you must first create cloud-based mail users or mailboxes before you migrate mailbox data.  G Suite migrations require the use of a Gmail endpoint.

Moving mailboxes between different servers or databases within a single on-premises Exchange forest (called a local move) doesn't require a migration endpoint.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
New-MigrationEndpoint -Name Endpoint1 -ExchangeRemoteMove -Autodiscover -EmailAddress tonysmith@contoso.com -Credentials (Get-Credential contoso\tonysmith)
```

This example creates an endpoint for remote moves by using the Autodiscover parameter to detect the settings.

### Example 2
```powershell
New-MigrationEndpoint -Name Endpoint2 -ExchangeRemoteMove -RemoteServer MRSServer.contoso.com -Credentials (Get-Credential Contoso.com\Administrator)
```

This example creates an endpoint for remote moves by specifying the settings manually.

### Example 3
```powershell
$Credentials = Get-Credential; New-MigrationEndpoint -ExchangeOutlookAnywhere -Name EXCH-AutoDiscover -Autodiscover -EmailAddress administrator@contoso.com -Credentials $Credentials
```

This example creates an Outlook Anywhere migration endpoint by using the Autodiscover parameter to detect the connection settings to the on-premises organization. Outlook Anywhere endpoints are used for cutover and staged Exchange migrations. The Get-Credential cmdlet is used to obtain the credentials for an on-premises account that has the necessary administrative privileges in the domain and that can access the mailboxes that will be migrated. When prompted for the user name, you can use either the email address or the domain\\username format for the administrator account. This account can be the same one that is specified by the EmailAddress parameter.

### Example 4
```powershell
New-MigrationEndpoint -ExchangeOutlookAnywhere -Name EXCH_Manual -ExchangeServer EXCH-01-MBX.contoso.com -RPCProxyServer EXCH-02-CAS.contoso.com -Credentials (Get-Credential administrator@contoso.com) -EmailAddress annb@contoso.com
```

This example creates an Outlook Anywhere migration endpoint by specifying the connection settings manually. Outlook Anywhere endpoints are used for cutover and staged Exchange migrations. The value for the ExchangeServer parameter specifies the on-premises Exchange server that hosts the mailboxes that will be migrated. The value for the RPCProxyServer parameter specifies the Exchange server in the on-premises organization that has the Client Access server role installed that directly accepts and proxies client connections. The EmailAddress parameter can specify any mailbox in the on-premises domain.

It's recommended that you use a migration endpoint created with connection settings that are automatically discovered (see Example 3) because the Autodiscover service will be used to connect to each user mailbox in the migration batch. If you manually specify the connection settings for the endpoint and a user mailbox isn't located on the server specified by the ExchangeServer parameter, the migration for that user will fail. This is important if you have multiple on-premises Outlook Anywhere servers. Otherwise, you may need to create different migration endpoints that correspond to each on-premises server.

### Example 5
```powershell
New-MigrationEndpoint -IMAP -Name IMAPEndpoint -RemoteServer imap.contoso.com -Port 993 -Security Ssl
```

This example creates an IMAP migration endpoint. The value for the RemoteServer parameter specifies the FQDN of the IMAP server that hosts the mailboxes that will be migrated. The endpoint is configured to use port 993 for SSL encryption.

### Example 6
```powershell
New-MigrationEndpoint -IMAP -Name IMAP_TLS_Endpoint -RemoteServer imap.contoso.com -Port 143 -Security Tls -MaxConcurrentMigrations 50 -MaxConcurrentIncrementalSyncs 10
```

This example creates an IMAP migration endpoint that supports 50 concurrent migrations and 10 concurrent incremental synchronizations. The endpoint is configured to use port 143 for TLS encryption.

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ServiceAccountKeyFileData
This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

The ServiceAccountKeyFileData parameter is used to specify information needed to authenticate as a service account. The data should come from the JSON key file that is downloaded when the service account that has been granted access to your remote tenant is created.

Use the following format for the value of this parameter: ([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes(\<path of the JSON file\>)). For example: -CSVData ([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\service-account.json"))

```yaml
Type: Byte[]
Parameter Sets: Gmail
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SourceMailboxLegacyDN
This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

The SourceMailboxLegacyDN parameter specifies the LegacyExchangeDN value of an on-premises mailbox that's used to test the ability of the migration service to create a connection using this endpoint. The cmdlet tries to access this mailbox using the credentials for the administrator account specified in the command.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: PublicFolder, LegacyPublicFolderToUnifiedGroup
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False

Parameter Sets: ExchangeOutlookAnywhere, IMAP, PublicFolder, LegacyPublicFolderToUnifiedGroup
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExchangeServer
This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

The ExchangeServer parameter specifies the FQDN of the on-premises Exchange server that hosts the mailboxes that will be migrated. This parameter is used when you create an Outlook Anywhere migration endpoint for cutover and staged Exchange migrations.

This parameter is required only when you don't use the Autodiscover parameter.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ExchangeOutlookAnywhere
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MailboxPermission
This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

The MailboxPermission parameter specifies what permissions to use to access the source mailbox during Outlook Anywhere onboarding (staged Exchange migration and cutover Exchange migration).

The migration administrator account specified for the endpoint must have one of the following permissions:

- Admin: The account is a domain administrator who can access any mailbox they want to migrate.

- FullAccess: The account is assigned either the Full Access permission to the mailboxes they want to migrate or the Receive As permission to the mailbox database that hosts the mailboxes that will be migrated.

If this parameter isn't specified, the cmdlet tries to access source mailboxes using the domain administrator permission and if that fails, it then tries to access the source mailboxes using the Full Access or Receive As permissions.

This parameter can't be used for creating non-Outlook Anywhere migration endpoints.

```yaml
Type: MigrationMailboxPermission
Parameter Sets: ExchangeOutlookAnywhereAutoDiscover, ExchangeOutlookAnywhere
Aliases:
