# Get-EcpVirtualDirectory

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Get-EcpVirtualDirectory cmdlet to view Exchange Control Panel (ECP) virtual directories that are used in Internet Information Services (IIS) on Microsoft Exchange servers. The Exchange admin center (EAC) uses the ECP virtual directories.

The ECP web management interface was introduced in Exchange Server 2010. In Exchange Server 2013 and Exchange Server 2016, the EAC virtual directories and the corresponding management cmdlets still use ECP in the name. You can use these cmdlets to manage ECP virtual directories on Exchange 2010, Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2016 servers.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
Get-EcpVirtualDirectory -Server Server01
```

This example returns a summary list of all Exchange Control Panel virtual directories on the server named Server01.

### Example 2
```
Get-EcpVirtualDirectory -Identity "Server01\ecp*" | Format-List
```

This example returns detailed information for the Exchange Control Panel virtual directory named "ecp (Default Web Site)" on the server named Server01.

### Example 3
```
Get-EcpVirtualDirectory
```

This example returns a summary list of all Exchange Control Panel virtual directories in the client access services on all Mailbox servers in the organization.

## PARAMETERS

### -Server
The Server parameter specifies the Exchange server that hosts the virtual directory. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

- Name

- FQDN

- Distinguished name (DN)

- ExchangeLegacyDN

You can't use the Server and Identity parameters in the same command.

```yaml
Type: ServerIdParameter
Parameter Sets: Set2
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ADPropertiesOnly
The ADPropertiesOnly switch specifies whether to return only the properties about the virtual directory stored in Active Directory. The properties stored in the Internet Information Services (IIS) metabase aren't returned.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the virtual directory that you want to view.

You can use any value that uniquely identifies the virtual directory. For example:

- Name or \<Server\>\\Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

The Name value uses the syntax "\<VirtualDirectoryName\> (\<WebsiteName\>)" from the properties of the virtual directory. You can specify the wildcard character (\*) instead of the default website by using the syntax \<VirtualDirectoryName\>\*.

You can't use the Identity and Server parameters in the same command.

```yaml
Type: VirtualDirectoryIdParameter
Parameter Sets: Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ShowMailboxVirtualDirectories
The ShowMailboxVirtualDirectories switch shows information about backend virtual directories on Mailbox servers. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

By default, this cmdlet shows information about virtual directories in the Client Access services on Mailbox servers. Client connections are proxied from the Client Access services on Mailbox servers to the backend services on Mailbox servers. Clients don't connect directly to the backend services.

We recommend that you use this parameter only under the direction of Microsoft Customer Service and Support.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
