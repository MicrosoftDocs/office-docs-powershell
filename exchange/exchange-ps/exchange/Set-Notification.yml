parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="EwsStoreObjectIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the notification event that you want to modify. You identify the notification event by its AlternativeID property value (a GUID). You can find this value by running the command: `Get-Notification | Format-List DisplayName,AlternativeID,StartTime,Status,Type`.

    Typically, it only makes sense to modify notification recipients for events that haven't completed (if the event has completed, no more notification messages will be sent).

    You can't use this parameter with the ProcessType parameter.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NotificationEmails
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The NotificationEmails parameter specifies the recipients for notification emails related to notification events. You can specify multiple recipients separated by commas.

    You need to use this parameter with either the ProcessType or Identity parameters:

    - ProcessType: The only ProcessType value that's allowed is CertExpiry.
    - Identity: You can modify the notification recipients for all types of notification events (CertExpiry, ExportPST, ImportPST, MailboxRestore, and Migration).

    For Migration events, you can also use the NotificationEmails parameter on the New-MigrationBatch, Set-MigrationBatch and Complete-MigrationBatch cmdlets to specify the notification email recipients.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="AsyncOperationType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ProcessType
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The ProcessType parameter specifies the notification event type that sends notification emails to users (specified by the required NotificationEmails parameter). The users receive email notification messages for all events of the specified type. The only valid value for this is parameter is CertExpiry.

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
