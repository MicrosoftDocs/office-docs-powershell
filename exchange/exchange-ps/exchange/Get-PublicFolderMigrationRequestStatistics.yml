### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Get-PublicFolderMigrationRequestStatistics cmdlet to view detailed information about serial public folder migration requests (requests created by the New-PublicFolderMigrationRequest cmdlet).

  **Note**: Support for serial migration of public folders ended in Exchange 2013 Cumulative Update 8 (CU8), and the cmdlets are no longer available in Exchange Online. Instead, use the corresponding **\*-MigrationBatch** and **\*-PublicFolderMailboxMigration\*** cmdlets.
