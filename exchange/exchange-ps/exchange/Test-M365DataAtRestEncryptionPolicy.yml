  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    The Identity parameter specifies the Microsoft 365 data-at-rest encryption policy that you want to test. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can find the existing data-at-rest encryption policies by using the Get-M365DataAtRestEncryptionPolicy cmdlet.
