### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Set-MailboxSearch cmdlet to modify an existing mailbox search.

  **Note**: As of October 2020, the \*-MailboxSearch cmdlets are retired in Exchange Online PowerShell. Use the \*-ComplianceSearch cmdlets in Security & Compliance PowerShell instead. For more information, see [Retirement of legacy eDiscovery tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/ediscovery-legacy-retirement).

- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Set-MailboxSearch -Identity "Legal-ProjectX" -AllPublicFolderSources $true
  description: |-
    In on-premises Exchange, this example adds all public folders to the existing mailbox search named Legal-ProjectX.

    **Note**: If we wanted to place the results of this search on In-Place Hold, the AllSourceMailboxes parameter must be set to $false. We could still include specific mailboxes in the search by using the SourceMailboxes parameter.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllPublicFolderSources
  description: |+
    The AllPublicFolderSources parameter specifies whether to include all public folders in the organization in the search. Valid values are:

    - $true: All public folders are included in the search. This value is required when the value of the AllSourceMailboxes parameter is $falseand you don't specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value is blank [$null]).
    - $false: No public folders are included in the search. This is the default value. You can use this value when the value of the AllSourceMailboxes parameter is $trueor you specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value isn't blank [$null]).

  name: AllSourceMailboxes
  description: |+
    The AllSourceMailboxes parameter specifies whether to include all mailboxes in the search. Valid values are:

    - $true: All mailboxes are included in the search. This value is required when the value of the AllPublicFolderSources parameter is $falseand you don't specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value is blank [$null]).
    - $false: All mailboxes aren't included in the search. This is the default value. You can use this value when the value of the AllPublicFolderSources parameter is $trueor you specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value isn't blank [$null]).

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    - $false: Unsearchable items aren't included in the results. This is the default value.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Set-MailboxSearch
name: Set-MailboxSearch
description: |-
  In on-premises Exchange, mailbox searches are used for In-Place eDiscovery and In-Place Hold. For In-Place eDiscovery, unless specified, mailboxes on all Mailbox servers in an organization are searched. To create an In-Place Hold, you need to specify the mailboxes to place on hold using the SourceMailboxes parameter. The search can be stopped, started, modified, and removed.

  By default, mailbox searches are performed across all Exchange 2013 or later Mailbox servers in an organization, unless you constrain the search to fewer mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter. To search mailboxes on Exchange 2010 Mailbox servers, run the command on an Exchange 2010 server.

  If the In-Place eDiscovery search you want to modify is running, stop it before using the Set-MailboxSearch cmdlet. When restarting a search, any previous search results are removed from the target mailbox.

  For more information, see [In-Place eDiscovery in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/ediscovery/ediscovery) and [In-Place Hold and Litigation Hold in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/holds/holds).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
