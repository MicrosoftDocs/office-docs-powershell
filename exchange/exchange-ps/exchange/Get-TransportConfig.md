# Get-TransportConfig

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-TransportConfig cmdlet to view organization-wide transport configuration settings.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-TransportConfig [[-Identity] <OrganizationIdParameter>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-TransportConfig cmdlet displays configuration information for global transport settings applied across the organization when the cmdlet is run on a Mailbox server. When this cmdlet is run on an Edge Transport server, only the transportation configuration settings for the local computer are shown.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-TransportConfig
```

This example lists the organization-wide transport settings on Mailbox server, or the local transport settings on an Edge Transport server.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-TransportConfig | Format-List *DSN*
```

This example lists all delivery status notification-related (DSN) configuration settings for your organization when run on a Mailbox server. When run on an Edge Transport server, it displays the DSN-related settings configured on that Edge Transport server.

## PARAMETERS

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.
