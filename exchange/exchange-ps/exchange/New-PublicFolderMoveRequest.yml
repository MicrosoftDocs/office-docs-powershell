### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the New-PublicFolderMoveRequest cmdlet to begin the process of moving public folder contents between public folder mailboxes. Moving public folders only moves the physical contents of the public folder; it doesn't change the logical hierarchy. When the move request is completed, you must run the Remove-PublicFolderMoveRequest cmdlet to remove the request or wait until the time specified in the CompletedRequestAgeLimit parameter has passed. The request must be removed before you can run another move request.

  Be aware that the target public folder mailbox will be locked while the move request is active. For more information, see the Description section.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AcceptLargeDataLoss
  description: |+
    The AcceptLargeDataLoss switch specifies that the request should continue even if a large number of items in the source mailbox can't be copied to the target mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You need to use this switch if you set the LargeItemLimit parameter to a value of 51 or higher. Otherwise, the command will fail.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowLargeItems
  description: |+
    The AllowLargeItems switch specifies that you can move large items only when they're encountered. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    Large items are email messages with a maximum of 1,023 attachments.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Unlimited" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BadItemLimit
  description: |+
    The BadItemLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of bad items that are allowed before the request fails. A bad item is a corrupt item in the source mailbox that can't be copied to the target mailbox. Also included in the bad item limit are missing items. Missing items are items in the source mailbox that can't be found in the target mailbox when the request is ready to be completed.

    Valid input for this parameter is an integer or the value unlimited. The default value is 0, which means that the request will fail if any bad items are detected. If you are OK with leaving a few bad items behind, you can set this parameter to a reasonable value (we recommend 10 or lower) so that the request can proceed. If too many bad items are detected, consider using the New-MailboxRepairRequest cmdlet to attempt to fix corrupted items in the source mailbox, and then try the request again.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Unlimited" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CompletedRequestAgeLimit
  description: |+
    The CompletedRequestAgeLimit parameter specifies how long the request will be kept after it has been completed before being automatically removed. The default value for this parameter is 30 days.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:

  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: Folders
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Folders parameter specifies the public folders that you want to move. If the public folder has child public folders, these child public folders won't be moved unless you explicitly state them in the command. You can move multiple public folders by separating them with a comma, for example, \\Dev\\CustomerEngagements,\\Dev\\RequestsforChange,\\Dev\\Usability.

  name: Priority
  description: |+

  name: RequestExpiryInterval
  description: |+
    The RequestExpiryInterval parameter specifies an age limit for a completed or failed request. When you use this parameter, the completed or failed request is automatically removed after the specified interval expires. If you don't use this parameter:

    - The completed request is automatically removed based on the CompletedRequestAgeLimit parameter value.
    - If the request fails, you need to manually remove it by using the corresponding Remove-\*Request cmdlet.

    To specify a value, enter it as a time span: dd.hh:mm:ss where dd = days, hh = hours, mm = minutes, and ss = seconds.

    When you use the value Unlimited, the completed request isn't automatically removed.

  name: Suspend
  description: |+
    The Suspend switch specifies whether to suspend the request. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you use this switch, the request is queued, but the request won't reach the status of InProgress until you resume the request with the relevant resume cmdlet.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.New-PublicFolderMoveRequest
name: New-PublicFolderMoveRequest
description: |-
  The New-PublicFolderMoveRequest cmdlet moves public folders from a source public folder mailbox to a target public folder mailbox. While the move request is active, the target public folder mailbox will be locked. As a result, public folders already residing in the target public folder mailbox will be inaccessible until the move request is complete. Therefore, before you begin the move request, you should ensure that no users are accessing public folder data in that target public folder mailbox.

  To move the public folder mailbox to another mailbox database, use the New-MoveRequest cmdlet. To ensure that this folder is already in the target public folder mailbox, run the Update-PublicFolderMailbox cmdlet against the target public folder mailbox. You can only perform one move request at a time. You can also move public folders by using the Move-PublicFolderBranch.ps1 script.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
