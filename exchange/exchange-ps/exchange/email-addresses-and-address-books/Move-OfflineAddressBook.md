# Move-OfflineAddressBook

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Move-OfflineAddressBook cmdlet to designate a new server responsible for generating the offline address book (OAB) in Exchange Server 2010. This cmdlet isn't used on OABs in Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Server 2013. To perform this task in Exchange 2016 or Exchange 2013, use the Set-OfflineAddressBook cmdlet with the GeneratingMailbox parameter.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Move-OfflineAddressBook [-Identity] <OfflineAddressBookIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Server <ServerIdParameter>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Move-OfflineAddressBook -Identity "My OAB" -Server "Server1"
```

This example moves OAB generation in Exchange 2010 to the server named Server1.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the GUID, distinguished name (DN), or OAB name that represents a specific OAB. You can also include the path by using the format Server\\OfflineAddressBookName.

You can omit the parameter label so that only the OAB name or GUID is supplied.

```yaml
Type: OfflineAddressBookIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Server
The Server parameter specifies the Exchange server where you want to run this command. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

- Name

- FQDN

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Exchange Legacy DN

If you don't use this parameter, the command is run on the local server.

```yaml
Type: ServerIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
