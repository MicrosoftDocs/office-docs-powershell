## PARAMETERS

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the email address policy that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

```yaml
Type: EmailAddressPolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IncludeMailboxSettingOnlyPolicy
This parameter is available or functional only in Exchange Server 2010.

The IncludeMailboxSettingOnlyPolicy parameter retrieves Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 address policies that contain only mailbox management configuration. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 supports both policies that contain only address policy settings and policies that contain address policy settings and mailbox management configuration. Exchange 2010 doesn't support policies that contain only mailbox management configuration, but Exchange 2003 policies that contain only mailbox management configuration are, by default, preserved and not upgraded. The IncludeMailboxSettingOnlyPolicy parameter is required to retrieve these policies.

The attributes of address policies that contain only mailbox management configuration can't be modified in Exchange 2010. These policies can only be removed.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
