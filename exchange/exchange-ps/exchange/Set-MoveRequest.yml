parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AcceptLargeDataLoss
  description: |+
    The AcceptLargeDataLoss switch specifies the request should continue even if a large number of items in the source mailbox can't be copied to the target mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    In Exchange 2013 or later or Exchange Online, you need to use this switch if you set the LargeItemLimit parameter to a value of 51 or higher. Otherwise, the command will fail.

    In Exchange 2010, you need to use this switch if you set the BadItemLimit parameter to a value of 51 or higher. Otherwise, the command will fail.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ArchiveTargetDatabase
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The ArchiveTargetDatabase parameter specifies the target mailbox database for the personal archive. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can use this parameter to change the target database only if the move request has a MoveStatus value of Queued.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Unlimited" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BadItemLimit
  description: |+
    The BadItemLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of bad items that are allowed before the request fails. A bad item is a corrupt item in the source mailbox that can't be copied to the target mailbox. Also included in the bad item limit are missing items. Missing items are items in the source mailbox that can't be found in the target mailbox when the request is ready to complete.

    Valid input for this parameter is an integer or the value unlimited. The default value is 0, which means the request will fail if any bad items are detected. If you are OK with leaving a few bad items behind, you can set this parameter to a reasonable value (we recommend 10 or lower) so the request can proceed. If too many bad items are detected, consider using the New-MailboxRepairRequest cmdlet to attempt to fix corrupted items in the source mailbox, and try the request again.

    In Exchange 2010, if you set this value to 51 or higher, you also need to use the AcceptLargeDataLoss switch. Otherwise, the command will fail.

    **Note**: This parameter is being deprecated in the cloud-based service. In the future, if you don't use this parameter, Skipped Item approval semantics will be used instead.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CompleteAfter
  description: |+
    The CompleteAfter parameter specifies a delay before the request is completed. The request is started, but not completed until the date/time you specify with this parameter.

    Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

    In Exchange Online PowerShell, if you specify a date/time value without a time zone, the value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

    To specify a date/time value for this parameter, use either of the following options:

    - Specify the date/time value in UTC: For example, "2021-05-06 14:30:00z".
    - Specify the date/time value as a formula that converts the date/time in your local time zone to UTC: For example, `(Get-Date "5/6/2021 9:30 AM").ToUniversalTime()`. For more information, see [Get-Date](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Get-Date).

  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: IncrementalSyncInterval
  description: |+
    The IncrementalSyncInterval parameter specifies the wait time between incremental syncs. This parameter is used together with the CompleteAfter parameter to create a move request that will do periodic incremental syncs after the initial sync is complete.

    To specify a value, enter it as a time span: dd.hh:mm:ss where dd = days, hh = hours, mm = minutes, and ss = seconds.

    Valid values are from 00:00:00 to 120.00:00:00 (120 days). The default value is 24 hours.

- type: <xref href="Unlimited" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LargeItemLimit
  description: |+
    The LargeItemLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of large items that are allowed before the request fails. A large item is a message in the source mailbox that exceeds the maximum message size that's allowed in the target mailbox. If the target mailbox doesn't have a specifically configured maximum message size value, the organization-wide value is used.

    For more information about maximum message size values, see the following topics:

    - Exchange 2016: [Message size limits in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow/message-size-limits)
    - Exchange Online: [Exchange Online Limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits)

    Valid input for this parameter is an integer or the value unlimited. The default value is 0, which means the request will fail if any large items are detected. If you are OK with leaving a few large items behind, you can set this parameter to a reasonable value (we recommend 10 or lower) so the request can proceed.

    If you set this value to 51 or higher, you also need to use the AcceptLargeDataLoss switch. Otherwise, the command will fail.

  name: PreventCompletion
  description: |+
    The PreventCompletion parameter specifies whether to run the move request, but not allow it to complete. Valid values are:

    - $true: The move request is run, but is not allowed to complete. Instead of this value, we recommend using the CompleteAfter parameter.
    - $false: This is the default value. The move request is run and allowed to complete. If you created the move request with the SuspendWhenReadyToComplete or PreventCompletion switches, set this parameter to $false before you run the Resume-MoveRequest cmdlet to complete the move request.

  name: ProxyToMailbox
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The ProxyToMailbox parameter specifies the move destination by the location of the specified mailbox (also known as proxying). You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address

  name: RemoteCredential
  description: |+
    The RemoteCredential parameter specifies the username and password an administrator who has permission to perform the mailbox move.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter.

  name: RequestExpiryInterval
  description: |+
    The RequestExpiryInterval parameter specifies an age limit for a completed or failed request. When you use this parameter, the completed or failed request is automatically removed after the specified interval expires. If you don't use this parameter:

    - The completed request is automatically removed based on the CompletedRequestAgeLimit parameter value.
    - If the request fails, you need to manually remove it by using the corresponding Remove-\*Request cmdlet.

    To specify a value, enter it as a time span: dd.hh:mm:ss where dd = days, hh = hours, mm = minutes, and ss = seconds.

    When you use the value Unlimited, the completed request isn't automatically removed.

  name: SkippedItemApprovalTime
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The SkippedItemApprovalTime parameter marks all of the skipped items discovered prior to the specified time as approved. If the data loss that was detected during this migration is significant, the migration will not be able to complete without approving skipped items. Items may have been skipped because they are corrupted in the source mailbox and can't be copied to the target mailbox, they are larger than the max allowable message size configured for the tenant, or they were detected as missing from the target mailbox when the migration is ready to complete.

    For more information about maximum message size values, see the following topic [Exchange Online Limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits).

    To specify a date/time value for this parameter, use either of the following options:

    - Specify the date/time value in UTC: For example, "2021-05-06 14:30:00z".
    - Specify the date/time value as a formula that converts the date/time in your local time zone to UTC: For example, `(Get-Date "5/6/2021 9:30 AM").ToUniversalTime()`. For more information, see [Get-Date](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Get-Date).

  name: StartAfter
  description: |+
    The StartAfter parameter specifies a delay before the request is started. The request isn't started until the date/time you specify with this parameter.

    Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

    In Exchange Online PowerShell, if you specify a date/time value without a time zone, the value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

    To specify a date/time value for this parameter, use either of the following options:

    - Specify the date/time value in UTC: For example, "2021-05-06 14:30:00z".
    - Specify the date/time value as a formula that converts the date/time in your local time zone to UTC: For example, `(Get-Date "5/6/2021 9:30 AM").ToUniversalTime()`. For more information, see [Get-Date](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Get-Date).
