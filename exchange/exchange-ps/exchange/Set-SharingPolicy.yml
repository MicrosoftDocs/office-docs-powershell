  code: |-
    Set-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Domains "mail.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple"
  description: |-
    This example modifies the sharing policy Contoso for contoso.com, which is a domain outside your organization. This policy allows users in the Contoso domain to see simple free/busy information.

- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Set-SharingPolicy -Identity SharingPolicy01 -Domains "contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple", "atlanta.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusyReviewer", "beijing.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusyReviewer"
  description: |-
    This example adds a second domain to the sharing policy SharingPolicy01. When you're adding a domain to an existing policy, you must include any previously included domains.

  code: |-
    Set-SharingPolicy -Identity "SharingPolicy01" -Enabled $false
  description: |-
    This example disables the sharing policy SharingPolicy01.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Default
  description: |+
    The Default switch specifies that the sharing policy is the default sharing policy for all mailboxes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If no sharing policy has been applied to a mailbox, the default policy is automatically applied. If you want to disable sharing across your organization, you disable the default policy.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Domains
  description: |+
    The Domains parameter specifies the domains and the associated sharing options for those domains in the sharing policy. Values for this parameter use the basic syntax: `'Domain: SharingPolicyAction'`.

    You can use the following values for `Domain`:

    - A domain: For example, `mail.contoso.com`. A domain doesn't include subdomains. You must configure each subdomain separately.
    - \*: Share with external federated organizations. For example, another Microsoft 365 organization or an on-premises Exchange organization.
    - Anonymous: Share with external, non-federated organizations and individuals with internet access.

    You can use the following values for `SharingPolicyAction`:

    - CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple: Share free/busy hours only
    - CalendarSharingFreeBusyDetail: Share free/busy hours, subject and location
    - CalendarSharingFreeBusyReviewer: Share free/busy hours, subject, location and the body of the message or calendar item
    - ContactsSharing: Share contacts only

    You can specify multiple `'Domain: SharingPolicyAction'` values separated by commas, and you can specify multiple `SharingPolicyAction` values for the same domain separated by commas. For example, `'mail.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple', 'mail.fabrikam.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusyDetail, ContactsSharing'`.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Set-SharingPolicy
name: Set-SharingPolicy
description: |-
  Users can only share free/busy and contact information after federation has been configured between Exchange organizations. After that, users can send sharing invitations to the external recipients as long as those invitations comply with the sharing policy. A sharing policy needs to be assigned to a mailbox to be effective. If a mailbox doesn't have a specific sharing policy assigned, a default policy enforces the sharing options for the mailbox.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
