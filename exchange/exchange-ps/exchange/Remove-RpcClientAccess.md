# Remove-RPCClientAccess

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

Use the Remove-RpcClientAccess cmdlet to remove the configuration information that allows RPC access through the Client Access server role on Microsoft Exchange Server 2010. After you remove the configuration information, the Exchange RPC Client Access service stops and no longer starts.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-RPCClientAccess -Server <ServerIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Disabling RPC client access on a server blocks all RPC access through the specified Client Access server. Therefore, RPC clients (for example, clients running Microsoft Office Outlook 2007) with mailboxes on any mailbox databases configured to use the specified Client Access server won't be able to connect.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-RpcClientAccess -Server CAS01
```

This example removes the configuration information for the Exchange RPC Client Access service for the Client Access server CAS01. Performing this action also shuts down the Exchange RPC Client Access service on the Client Access server CAS01.

## PARAMETERS

### -Server
The Server parameter specifies the Client Access server where you want to run this command. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

- Name

- FQDN

- Distinguished name (DN)

- ExchangeLegacyDN

```yaml
Type: ServerIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
