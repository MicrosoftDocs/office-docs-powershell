# Search-MessageTrackingReport

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Search-MessageTrackingReport cmdlet to find the unique message tracking report based on the search criteria provided. You can then pass this message tracking report ID to the Get-MessageTrackingReport cmdlet to get full message tracking information. For more information, see [Get-MessageTrackingReport](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/get-messagetrackingreport). The message tracking report cmdlets are used by the delivery reports feature.

In Exchange Online, delivery reports has been replaced by message trace (the Get-MessageTrace and Get-MessageTraceDetail cmdlets).

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Search-MessageTrackingReport -Identity "David Jones" -Recipients "wendy@contoso.com"
```

This example searches the message tracking report for messages sent from one user to another. This example returns the message tracking report for a message that David Jones sent to Wendy Richardson.

### Example 2
```powershell
Search-MessageTrackingReport -Identity "Cigdem Akin" -Sender "joe@contoso.com" -BypassDelegateChecking -DoNotResolve
```

This example searches the message tracking report for the following scenario: The user Cigdem Akin was expecting an email message from joe@contoso.com that never arrived. She contacted the Help desk, which needs to generate the message tracking report on behalf of Cigdem and doesn't need to see the display names.

This example returns the message tracking reports that the Help desk can analyze to resolve the issue.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter scopes the search to the specified mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

- Name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- \<domain name\>\\\<account name\>

- Email address

- GUID

- LegacyExchangeDN

- SamAccountName

- User ID or user principal name (UPN)

When you use this parameter without the Sender parameter, the specified mailbox is the message sender that's used in the search. You can specify the recipients by using the Recipients parameter.

When you use this parameter with the Sender parameter, the specified mailbox is message recipient that's used in the search.

```yaml
Type: MailboxIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Sender
The Sender parameter specifies the email address of the message sender for messages that are sent to the mailbox that's specified by the Identity parameter.

You need to use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

```yaml
Type: SmtpAddress
Parameter Sets: SearchAsSender
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BypassDelegateChecking
The BypassDelegateChecking switch allows Help desk staff and administrators to track messages for any user. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

By default, users can only track messages that they send or receive from their own mailbox.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DoNotResolve
The DoNotResolve switch specifies whether to prevent the resolution of email addresses to display names. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

Using this switch improves performance, but the lack of display names might make the results more difficult to interpret.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MessageEntryId
This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MessageId
The MessageId parameter filters the results by the Message-ID header field of the message. This value is also known as the Client ID. The format of the Message-ID depends on the messaging server that sent the message. The value should be unique for each message. However, not all messaging servers create values for the Message-ID in the same way. Be sure to include the full Message ID string (which may include angle brackets) and enclose the value in quotation marks (for example, "<d9683b4c-127b-413a-ae2e-fa7dfb32c69d@contoso.com>").

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Recipients
The Recipients parameter filters the results by the email addresses of the specified recipients. You can specify multiple email addresses separated by commas.

You can't use this parameter with the Sender parameter.

```yaml
Type: SmtpAddress[]
Parameter Sets: SearchAsRecipient
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResultSize
The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Subject
The Subject parameter searches for messages with the specified Subject field value. If the value contains spaces, enclosed the value in quotation marks.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TraceLevel
The TraceLevel parameter specifies the details to include in the results. Valid values are:

- Low: Minimal additional data is returned, including servers that were accessed, timing, message tracking search result counts, and any error information.

- Medium: In addition to all the data returned for the Low setting, the actual message tracking search results are also returned.

- High: Full diagnostic data is returned.

You only need to use this parameter for troubleshooting message tracking issues.

```yaml
Type: TraceLevel
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
