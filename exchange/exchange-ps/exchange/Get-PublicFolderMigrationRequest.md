# Get-PublicFolderMigrationRequest

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Get-PublicFolderMigrationRequest cmdlet to view information about serial public folder migration requests (requests created by the New-PublicFolderMigrationRequest cmdlet).

**Note**: Support for serial migration of public folders ended in Exchange 2013 Cumulative Update 8 (CU8), and the cmdlets are no longer available in Exchange Online. Instead, use the corresponding **\*-MigrationBatch** and **\*-PublicFolderMailboxMigration\*** cmdlets.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).
