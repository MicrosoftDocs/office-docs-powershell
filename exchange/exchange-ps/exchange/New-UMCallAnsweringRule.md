The New-UMCallAnsweringRule cmdlet creates a Unified Messaging (UM) call answering rule stored in a UM-enabled user's mailbox. You can run the cmdlet and create a call answering rule of the user that's logged on or use the Mailbox parameter to specify the mailbox where you want the call answering rule to be created. You can use the New-UMCallAnsweringRule cmdlet to specify the following conditions:

- Who the incoming call is from

- Time of day

- Calendar free/busy status

- Whether automatic replies are turned on for email

You can also specify the following actions:

- Find me

- Transfer the caller to someone else

- Leave a voice message

After this task is completed, the cmdlet sets the parameters and the values specified.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you.

### Example 2
```powershell
New-UMCallAnsweringRule -Name MyCallAnsweringRule -CallerIds "1,4255550100,,","1,4255550123,," -Priority 2 -CallersCanInterruptGreeting $true -Mailbox tonysmith
```

This example creates the following actions on the call answering rule MyCallAnsweringRule in the mailbox for tonysmith:

- Sets the call answering rule to two caller IDs.

- Sets the priority of the call answering rule to 2.

- Sets the call answering rule to allow callers to interrupt the greeting.

### Example 3
```powershell
New-UMCallAnsweringRule -Name MyCallAnsweringRule -Priority 2 -Mailbox tonysmith@contoso.com -ScheduleStatus 0x8
```

This example creates the call answering rule MyCallAnsweringRule in the mailbox for tonysmith that sets the free/busy status to Out of Office and sets the priority to 2.

### Example 4

## PARAMETERS

### -Name
The Name parameter specifies the name of the Unified Messaging (UM) call answering rule or Call Answering Rule ID being modified. The call answering ID or name must be unique per the user's UM-enabled mailbox. The name or ID for the call answering rule can contain up to 255 characters.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CallerIds
The CallerIds parameter specifies an entry for the "If the Caller is" condition. Each entry for this parameter can contain a phone number, an Active Directory contact, a personal contact, or the personal Contacts folder. The parameter can contain 50 phone numbers or contact entries and no more than one entry for specifying the default Contacts folder. If the CallerIds parameter doesn't contain a condition, the condition isn't set and is ignored. The default value is $null.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CallersCanInterruptGreeting
The CallersCanInterruptGreeting parameter specifies whether a caller can interrupt the voice mail greeting while it's being played. The default is $null.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CheckAutomaticReplies
The CheckAutomaticReplies parameter specifies an entry for the "If My Automatic Replies are Enabled" condition. The default is $false.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False

Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -KeyMappings
The KeyMappings parameter specifies a key mapping entry for a call answering rule. The key mappings are those menu options offered to callers if the call answering rule is set to $true. You can configure a maximum of 10 entries. None of the defined key mappings can overlap. The default is $null.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

### -Priority
The Priority parameter specifies the order that the call answering rule will be evaluated against other existing call answering rules. Call answering rules are processed in order of increasing priority values. The priority must be unique between all call answering rules in the UM-enabled mailbox. The priority on the call answering rule must be between 1 (highest) and 9 (lowest). The default is 9.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None

```

### -ScheduleStatus
The ScheduleStatus parameter specifies an entry for the "If my Schedule show that I am" condition. Users can specify their free/busy status to be checked.

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
