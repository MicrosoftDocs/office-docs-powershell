parameters:
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ActiveDirectoryTimeout
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The ActiveDirectoryTimeout parameter specifies the amount of time, in seconds, allowed for each Active Directory operation to complete before the operation times out. The default value is 15 seconds.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllConnectionsTimeout
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The AllConnectionsTimeout parameter specifies the amount of time, in seconds, allowed for all connections to complete before the cmdlet times out. The time-out countdown doesn't begin until all information necessary to perform the connections is gathered from Active Directory.The default value is 90 seconds.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Archive
  description: |+
    The Archive switch specifies whether to test the MAPI connectivity of the personal archive that's associated with the specified mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you don't use this switch, only the primary mailbox is tested.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CopyOnServer
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The CopyOnServer parameter specifies the Mailbox server that holds the specific database copy to test. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Exchange Legacy DN

    You can only use this parameter with the Server parameter, not the Identify or Database parameters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019

    The Database parameter specifies the database on which to test the connectivity to the system mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    If you don't use this parameter or the Identity parameter, the command tests the SystemMailbox on each active database on the Exchange server (the local Exchange server or the server you specify with the Server parameter).

    You can't use the Identity, Database, or Server parameters in the same command.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named

    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    This cmdlet accepts pipeline input from the Get-Mailbox or Get-Recipient cmdlet. If you pipe the identify from the Get-Mailbox or Get-Recipient cmdlets, you don't need to use this parameter.

    If you don't use this parameter, the cmdlet tests the SystemMailbox on the database that you specify.

    You can't use the Identity, Database, or Server parameters in the same command.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Exchange Legacy DN

    If you don't specify this parameter, the command tests the mailbox on the local server.

    You can't use the Identity, Database, or Server parameters in the same command.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Test-MAPIConnectivity
name: Test-MAPIConnectivity
description: |-
  The Test-MapiConnectivity cmdlet verifies server functionality. This cmdlet logs on to the mailbox that you specify (or to the SystemMailbox if you don't specify the Identity parameter) and retrieves a list of items in the Inbox. Logging on to the mailbox tests two critical protocols used when a client connects to a Mailbox server: MAPI and LDAP. During authentication, the Test-MapiConnectivity cmdlet indirectly verifies that the MAPI server, Exchange store, and Directory Service Access (DSAccess) are working.

  The cmdlet logs on to the mailbox that you specify using the credentials of the account with which you're logged on to the local computer. After a successful authentication, the Test-MapiConnectivity cmdlet accesses the mailbox to verify that the database is working. If a successful connection to a mailbox is made, the cmdlet also determines the time that the logon attempt occurred.

  There are three distinct parameters that you can use with the command: Database, Identity and Server:

  - The Database parameter takes a database identity and tests the ability to log on to the system mailbox on the specified database.
  - The Identity parameter takes a mailbox identity and tests the ability to log on to a specific mailbox.
  - The Server parameter takes a server identity and tests the ability to log on to each system mailbox on the specified server.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
