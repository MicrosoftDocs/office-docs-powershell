  code: |-
    $UserCredentials = Get-Credential

    Get-DomainController -DomainName corp.contoso.com -Credential $UserCredentials | Format-Table -AutoSize Name,ADSite
  description: |-
    This example retrieves a list of global catalog servers in the corp.contoso.com domain. Because a different set of credentials are required to access this domain, the Get-Credential cmdlet is used to obtain the username and password from the user.

    The first command displays a prompt to the user that accepts the username and password. The credentials are then stored in the $UserCredentials variable. The second command uses the $UserCredentials variable for the Credential parameter value. To make the list more readable, the output is piped to the Format-Table cmdlet and only the Name and ADSite properties are displayed.

    For more information about pipelining and the Format-Table cmdlet, see [About Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_pipelines) and [Working with command output](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/working-with-command-output-exchange-2013-help).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="NetworkCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.

    This parameter requires the creation and passing of a credential object. This credential object is created by using the Get-Credential cmdlet. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

    If you use the Forest parameter, the credentials are used to access the forest.
