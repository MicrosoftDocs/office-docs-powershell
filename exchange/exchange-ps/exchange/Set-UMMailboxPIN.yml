parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnoreDefaultScope
  description: |+
    The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange PowerShell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch enables the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope, but also introduces the following restrictions:

    - You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.
    - You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LockedOut
  description: |+
    The LockedOut parameter specifies whether the mailbox will continue to be locked. If set to $true, the mailbox is marked as locked out. By default, if this parameter is omitted or set to $false, the command clears the locked-out status on the mailbox.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NotifyEmail
  description: |+
    The NotifyEmail parameter specifies the email address to which the server sends the email message that contains the PIN reset information. By default, the message is sent to the SMTP address of the enabled user.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Pin
  description: |+
    The Pin parameter specifies a new PIN for use with the mailbox. The PIN is checked against the PIN rules defined in the Unified Messaging mailbox policy. If the PIN isn't supplied, the command generates a new PIN for the mailbox and includes it in an email message sent to the user.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PINExpired
  description: |+
    The PINExpired parameter specifies whether the PIN is treated as expired. If this parameter is supplied and is set to $false, the user isn't required to reset the PIN the next time that the user logs on. If the PIN isn't supplied, the PIN is treated as expired and the user is prompted to reset the PIN the next time that the user logs on.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Set-UMMailboxPIN
name: Set-UMMailboxPIN
description: |-
  The Set-UMMailboxPIN cmdlet is used when a UM-enabled user has been locked out of a mailbox because either the user tried to log on by using an incorrect PIN multiple times or because the user has forgotten the PIN. You can use this cmdlet to set the user's PIN. The new PIN must comply with the PIN policy rules specified in the user's mailbox policy. The new PIN is sent to the user in an email message, or sent to an alternative email address. You can control whether the user must reset the PIN at logon and if the mailbox will continue to be locked.

  After this task is completed, the PIN on a UM-enabled mailbox is set.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
