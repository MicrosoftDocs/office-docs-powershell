# New-DynamicDistributionGroup

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the New-DynamicDistributionGroup cmdlet to create dynamic distribution groups. A dynamic distribution group queries mail-enabled objects and builds the group membership based on the results. The group membership is recalculated whenever an email message is sent to the group.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## DESCRIPTION
The Conditional parameters that are used with the IncludedRecipients parameter are subject to the following limitations:

- The EQV operator is used for every property value, as in "Department equals Sales". Wildcards and partial matches aren't supported.

- The OR operator is always used for multiple values of the same property, as in "Department equals Sales OR Marketing".

- The AND operator is always used for multiple properties, as in "Department equals Sales AND Company equals Contoso".

To create flexible filters that use any available recipient property and that aren't subject to these limitations, you can use the RecipientFilter parameter to create an OPath filter.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
New-DynamicDistributionGroup -Name "Marketing Group" -IncludedRecipients "MailboxUsers,MailContacts" -ConditionalDepartment "Marketing","Sales"
```

This example creates a dynamic distribution group named Marketing Group that contains all recipients who have a Department field that equals the strings "Marketing" or "Sales". Because we didn't use the OrganizationalUnit or RecipientContainer parameters, the group looks for recipients in the default location (typically, the Users container).

### Example 2
```
New-DynamicDistributionGroup -Name "Washington Management Team" -RecipientFilter {(RecipientType -eq 'UserMailbox') -and (Title -like 'Director*' -or Title -like 'Manager*') -and (StateOrProvince -eq 'WA')} -RecipientContainer "North America"
```

This example creates a dynamic distribution group named Washington Management Team that contains all users in the organizational unit named North America from Washington State whose titles start with "Director" or "Manager".

## PARAMETERS

### -IncludedRecipients
The IncludedRecipients parameter specifies a filter that's based on the recipient type. Valid values are:

- AllRecipients: This value can be used only by itself.

- MailboxUsers

- MailContacts

- MailGroups

- MailUsers

- Resources: This value indicates room or equipment mailboxes.

You can specify multiple values separated by commas. When you use multiple values, the OR Boolean operator is applied.

You need to use this parameter when you use any of the Conditional parameters. You can't use this parameter with the RecipientFilter parameter.

```yaml
Type: None | MailboxUsers | Resources | MailContacts | MailGroups | MailUsers | AllRecipients
Parameter Sets: Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
The Name parameter specifies the unique name of the dynamic distribution group. The maximum length is 64 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

This value is also used for the DisplayName property if you don't use the DisplayName parameter.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RecipientFilter
The RecipientFilter parameter specifies an OPath filter that's based on the value of any available recipient property. You can use any available Windows PowerShell operator, and wildcards and partial matches are supported. When you use this parameter, remember the following OPath filter rules:

- Use braces { } around the whole OPath syntax string.

- Include a hyphen before all operators.

- In cloud-based environments, you can't use a wildcard as the first character. For example, Sales\* is allowed, but \*Sales isn't allowed.

For more information, see Filterable properties for the -RecipientFilter parameter (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb738157.aspx).

You can't use this parameter with the IncludedRecipients parameter or any of the Conditional parameters.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: Set2
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Alias
The Alias parameter specifies the Exchange alias (also known as the mail nickname) for the recipient. This value identifies the recipient as a mail-enabled object, and shouldn't be confused with multiple email addresses for the same recipient (also known as proxy addresses). A recipient can have only one Alias value.

The value of Alias can contain letters, numbers and the characters !, #, $, %, &, ', \*, +, -, /, =, ?, ^, \_, `, {, |, } and ~. Periods (.) are allowed, but each period must be surrounded by other valid characters (for example, help.desk). Unicode characters from U+00A1 to U+00FF are also allowed. The maximum length of the Alias value is 64 characters.

When you create a recipient without specifying an email address, the Alias value you specify is used to generate the primary email address (\<alias\>@\<domain\>). Supported Unicode characters are mapped to best-fit US-ASCII text characters. For example, U+00F6 (ö) is changed to oe in the primary email address.

If you don't use the Alias parameter when you create a recipient, the value of a different required parameter is used for the Alias property value:

- Recipients with user accounts (for example, user mailboxes, and mail users): The left side of the MicrosoftOnlineServicesID or UserPrincipalName parameter is used. For example, helpdesk@contoso.com results in the Alias property value helpdesk.

- Recipeints without user accounts (for example, room mailboxes, mail contacts, and distribution groups): The value of the Name parameter is used. Spaces are removed and unsupported characters are converted to question marks (?).

If you modify the Alias value of an existing recipient, the primary email address is automatically updated only in environments where the recipient is subject to email address policies (the EmailAddressPolicyEnabled property is True for the recipient).

The Alias parameter never generates or updates the primary email address of a mail contact or a mail user.

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisplayName
The DisplayName parameter specifies the display name of the dynamic distribution group. The display name is visible in the Exchange admin center and in address lists. The maximum length is 256 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ModeratedBy
The ModeratedBy parameter specifies one or more moderators for this recipient. A moderator approves messages sent to the recipient before the messages are delivered. A moderator must be a mailbox, mail user, or mail contact in your organization. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the moderator.

For example:

- Name

- Display name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- Email address

- GUID

To enter multiple values, use the following syntax: \<value1\>,\<value2\>,...\<valueX\>. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: "\<value1\>","\<value2\>",..."\<valueX\>".

You need to use this parameter to specify at least one moderator when you set the ModerationEnabled parameter to the value $true.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False

The ModerationEnabled parameter specifies whether moderation is enabled for this recipient. Valid value are:

- $true: Moderation is enabled for this recipient. Messages sent to this recipient must be approved by a moderator before the messages are delivered.

- $false: Moderation is disabled for this recipient. Messages sent to this recipient are delivered without the approval of a moderator. This is the default value.

You use the ModeratedBy parameter to specify the moderators.

```yaml
Type: $true | $false
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OrganizationalUnit
The OrganizationalUnit parameter specifies the organizational unit (OU) where the dynamic distribution group is created.

Valid input for this parameter is an organizational unit (OU) or domain that's visible using the Get-OrganizationalUnit cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OU or domain. For example:

- Name

- Canonical name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

If you don't use this parameter, the default value is typically the Users container in the domain of the Exchange server that you're connected to (also known as the recipient scope). You can change the recipient scope for the current PowerShell session by using the Set-AdServerSettings cmdlet.

If you don't use the RecipientContainer parameter, the location of the dynamic distribution group is used for the RecipientContainer property (the default location, or the value you specify for the OrganizationalUnit parameter).

```yaml
Type: OrganizationalUnitIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

The PrimarySmtpAddress parameter specifies the primary return email address that's used for the recipient. If it's available on this cmdlet, you can't use the EmailAddresses and PrimarySmtpAddress parameters in the same command.

```yaml
Type: SmtpAddress
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RecipientContainer
The RecipientContainer parameter specifies a filter that's based on the recipient's location in Active Directory. Valid input for this parameter is an organizational unit (OU) or domain that's visible using the Get-OrganizationalUnit cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OU or domain. For example:

- Name

- Canonical name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

If you don't use this parameter, the default value is the OU where the object was created.

Note that the RecipientContainer property can't be blank. The group is always limited to looking for recipients in a specific location (the value you specify for this parameter, or the location where the group was created).

```yaml
Type: OrganizationalUnitIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SendModerationNotifications
The SendModerationNotifications parameter specifies when moderation notification messages are sent. Valid values are:

- Always: Notify all senders when their messages aren't approved. This is the default value.

- Internal: Notify senders in the organization when their messages aren't approved.

- Never: Don't notify anyone when a message isn't approved.

This parameter is only meaningful when moderation is enabled (the ModerationEnabled parameter has the value $true).

```yaml
Type: Never | Internal | Always
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
