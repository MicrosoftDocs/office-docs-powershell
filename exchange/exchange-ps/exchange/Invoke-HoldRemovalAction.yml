parameters:
- type: <xref href="HoldRemovalActionType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Action
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Action parameter specifies the mode that the cmdlet operates in. Valid values are:

    - GetHoldRemovals: Shows all hold removals that were done using this cmdlet.
    - GetHolds: Shows holds on the specified mailbox (the ExchangeLocation parameter) or SharePoint site (the SharePointLocation parameter).
    - RemoveHold: Removes the specified hold (the HoldId parameter) from the specified mailbox (the ExchangeLocation parameter) or SharePoint site (the SharePointLocation parameter).

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExchangeLocation
  description: |+
    The ExchangeLocation parameter specifies the email address of the mailbox that contains the holds to view or remove.

    This parameter is required when you use the value GetHolds or RemoveHold for the Action parameter.

  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to force remove the hold even when the policy is active. Instead, you should remove the hold from the case hold policy.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HoldId
  description: |+
    The HoldId parameter specifies the hold that you want to view or remove.

    To find valid values for this parameter, use this cmdlet with the Action parameter value GetHolds and look for the HoldId property in the output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
