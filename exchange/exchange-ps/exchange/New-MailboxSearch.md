# New-MailboxSearch

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

On July 1, 2018, you'll no longer be able to use the New-MailboxSearch cmdlet to create In-Place eDiscovery searches and In-Place Holds in Exchange Online. To create eDiscovery searches and eDiscovery case holds, please start using New-ComplianceSearch and New-CaseHoldPolicy in the Security & Compliance Center. You'll still be able to use Set-MailboxSearch to modify existing In-Place eDiscovery searches and In-Place Holds. Creating new searches and holds in Exchange Server 2013 will still be supported, and searches run from your on-premises organization in an Exchange hybrid deployment aren't affected by this change.

Use the New-MailboxSearch cmdlet to create a mailbox search and either get an estimate of search results, place search results on In-Place Hold or copy them to a Discovery mailbox. You can also place all contents in a mailbox on hold by not specifying a search query, which accomplishes similar results as Litigation Hold.

By default, mailbox searches are performed across all Exchange 2013 or later Mailbox servers in an Exchange organization, unless you constrain the search to fewer mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter. To search mailboxes on Exchange 2010 Mailbox servers, run the command on an Exchange 2010 server.

For more information, see [In-Place eDiscovery in Exchange Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/ediscovery/ediscovery) and [In-Place Hold and Litigation Hold in Exchange Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/holds/holds).

## DESCRIPTION
The New-MailboxSearch cmdlet creates an In-Place eDiscovery search or an In-Place Hold. Unless specified, mailboxes on all Mailbox servers in an organization are searched. You can stop, start, modify, or remove the search.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
New-MailboxSearch -Name "Legal-ProjectX" -SourceMailboxes DG-Marketing,DG-Executives -TargetMailbox LegalDiscovery@contoso.com -StartDate "01/01/2018" -EndDate "12/31/2018" -Recipients "@contoso.com" -SearchQuery "project report hasattachments:true" -StatusMailRecipients "DG-DiscoveryTeam"
```

This example creates the mailbox search Legal-ProjectX. The search uses several parameters to restrict the search query:

- SourceMailboxes: This parameter restricts the search to members of the DG-Marketing and DG-Executives distribution groups.

- Recipients: This parameter specifies that the search includes all mail sent to the domain contoso.com.

- SearchQuery: This parameter specifies a KQL query for messages with either the words project or report and for messages with attachments.

- StartDate and EndDate: These parameters specify the start date of January 1, 2018, and end date of December 31, 2018, for the search.

- TargetMailbox: This parameter specifies that search results should be copied to the discovery mailbox LegalDiscovery.

- StatusMailRecipients: This parameter specifies that the distribution group DG-DiscoveryTeam is to receive a notification when the search is complete.

### Example 2
```powershell
New-MailboxSearch -Name "Hold-ProjectX" -SourceMailboxes DG-Finance -InPlaceHoldEnabled $true
```

This example creates an In-Place Hold Hold-ProjectX and places all members of the distribution group DG-Finance on hold. Because the search doesn't specify the SearchQuery and ItemHoldPeriod parameters, all messages in mailboxes returned are placed on indefinite In-Place Hold.

### Example 3
```powershell
New-MailboxSearch -Name "Hold-tailspintoys" -SourceMailboxes DG-Research -SearchQuery "'Patent' AND 'Project tailspintoys'" -InPlaceHoldEnabled $true
```

This example creates an In-Place Hold Hold-tailspintoys and places all members of the distribution group DG-Research on hold. Because the search specifies the SearchQuery parameter, only messages that match the search query are placed on indefinite In-Place Hold.

### Example 4
```powershell
New-MailboxSearch -Name "Hold for all PFs" -AllPublicFolderSources $true -InPlaceHoldEnabled $true
```

In on-premises Exchange, this example creates an In-Place Hold named Hold for all PFs that places all content in all public folders on In-Place hold, with an unlimited hold duration.

## PARAMETERS

### -Name
The Name parameter specifies a friendly name for the search. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

The value of this parameter is used to create the top-level folder that holds the search results in the target mailbox that's specified by the TargetMailbox parameter.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllPublicFolderSources
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The AllPublicFolderSources parameter specifies whether to include all public folders in the organization in the search. Valid values are:

- $true: All public folders are included in the search. This value is required when the value of the AllSourceMailboxes parameter is $false and you don't specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value is blank [$null]).

- $false: No public folders are included in the search. This is the default value. You can use this value when the value of the AllSourceMailboxes parameter is $true or you specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value isn't blank [$null]).

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllSourceMailboxes
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The AllSourceMailboxes parameter specifies whether to include all mailboxes in the search. Valid values are:

- $true: All mailboxes are included in the search. This value is required when the value of the AllPublicFolderSources parameter is $false and you don't specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value is blank [$null]).

- $false: All mailboxes aren't included in the search. This is the default value. You can use this value when the value of the AllPublicFolderSources parameter is $true or you specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value isn't blank [$null]).

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```

### -IncludeUnsearchableItems
The IncludeUnsearchableItems switch specifies that items that couldn't be indexed by Exchange Search should be included in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

Unsearchable items aren't placed on hold for a query-based In-Place Hold. If you need to place unsearchable items on hold, you need to create an indefinite hold (a hold without specifying any search parameters, which provides functionality similar to Litigation Hold.

- An integer.

- The value unlimited. This is the default value. Items are held until you remove the In-Place Hold by removing the search by using the Remove-MailboxSearch cmdlet, removing the source mailbox from the search by using the Set-MailboxSearch cmdlet and the SourceMailboxes parameter, or in on-premises Exchange, you remove all public folders from the search by using the Set-MailboxSearch cmdlet to change the AllPublicFolderSources parameter from $true to $false.
