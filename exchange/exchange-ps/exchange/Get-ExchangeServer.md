# Get-ExchangeServer

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Get-ExchangeServer cmdlet to view the properties of Exchange servers.

When you run the Get-ExchangeServer cmdlet with no parameters, it returns the attributes of all the servers in the Exchange organization. To return specific server properties (including domain controller information) where the Get-ExchangeServer cmdlet has to contact servers directly or perform a complex or slow calculation, make sure you use the Status parameter.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

### Domain
```
Get-ExchangeServer -Domain <Fqdn>
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Status] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Identity
```
Get-ExchangeServer [[-Identity] <ServerIdParameter>]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Status] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The ExchangeVersion attribute returned is the minimum version of Microsoft Exchange that you can use to manage the returned object. This attribute isn't the same as the version of Exchange displayed in the Exchange admin center when you select Server Configuration.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-ExchangeServer | Format-List
```

This example returns a summary list of all the Exchange servers in the organization.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-ExchangeServer -Identity Mailbox01 | Format-List
```

This example returns detailed information about the Exchange server named Mailbox01.

## PARAMETERS

### -Domain
The Domain parameter filters the results by the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain (for example, contoso.com).

You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: Domain
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the Exchange server that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the Exchange server. For example:

- Name

- GUID

- Distinguished name (DN)

- ExchangeLegacyDN

You can't use this parameter with the Domain parameter.

```yaml
Type: ServerIdParameter
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Status
The Status switch specifies whether to include additional property values in the results, for example, the Watson state, StaticDomainControllers, and runtime domain controller usage. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

To see the additional values, you need to pipe the output to a formatting cmdlet, for example, the Format-List cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
