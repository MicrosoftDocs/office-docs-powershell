parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Archive
  description: |+
    The Archive switch restricts the scope of the cmdlet to the user's archive. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    When using the Archive switch, you must also specify the Identity parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EndDate
  description: |+
    The EndDate parameter specifies the end date of the date range.

    Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ErrorCode
  description: |+
    The ErrorCode parameter allows you to retrieve documents that failed indexing with a specific error code. You can use the cmdlet without this parameter to list all failed documents for a mailbox, a mailbox database or a Mailbox server. The output includes the error codes and reason for failure. If required, you can then restrict the output to a specific error code from the results.

  defaultValue: None

  name: FailureMode
  description: |+
    The FailureMode parameter specifies the type of error. Use the following values.

    - Transient: Returns items that couldn't be indexed due to transient errors. Exchange Search attempts to index these items again.
    - Permanent: Returns items that couldn't be indexed due to a permanent error. Exchange Search does not attempt to index these items again.
    - All: Returns items that couldn't be indexed regardless of nature of failure.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Get-FailedContentIndexDocuments
name: Get-FailedContentIndexDocuments
description: |-
  The Get-FailedContentIndexDocuments cmdlet returns a list of documents that couldn't be indexed. The most common reason is that there was no filter available for that document type or there was an attachment within the document. For example, the PDF filter isn't available by default. If an email message contains a PDF document, because there is no PDF filter, the document is marked as failed content indexing.

  After a new filter is installed, only new messages with attachments of the type for which the filter is installed are indexed. If you want to index older messages for the document type, the mailbox has to be moved.

  The cmdlet output provides details about items in a mailbox that couldn't be indexed, including an error code and the reason for failure.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
