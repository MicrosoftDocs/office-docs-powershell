examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    New-ManagementScope -Name "Mailbox Servers 1 through 3" -ServerList MailboxServer1, MailboxServer2, MailboxServer3
  description: |-
    This example creates a scope that includes only the servers MailboxServer1, MailboxServer2, and MailboxServer3. Users assigned roles using management role assignments that have the scope in this example can only perform against the servers included in the scope.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    New-ManagementScope -Name "Redmond Site Scope" -ServerRestrictionFilter "ServerSite -eq 'CN=Redmond,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=com'"
  description: |-
    This example creates the scope named Redmond Site Scope and sets a server restriction filter that matches only the servers located in the "CN=Redmond,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=com" Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) site.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    New-ManagementScope -Name "Executive Mailboxes" -RecipientRoot "contoso.com/Executives" -RecipientRestrictionFilter "RecipientType -eq 'UserMailbox'"
  description: |-
    This example creates the Executive Mailboxes scope. Only mailboxes located within the Executives OU in the contoso.com domain match the recipient restriction filter.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 4
  code: |-
    New-ManagementScope -Name "Protected Exec Users" -RecipientRestrictionFilter "Title -like 'VP*'" -Exclusive

    New-ManagementRoleAssignment -SecurityGroup "Executive Administrators" -Role "Mail Recipients" -CustomRecipientWriteScope "Protected Exec Users"
  description: |-
    This example creates the Protected Exec Users exclusive scope. Users that contain the string "VP" in their title match the recipient filter for the scope. When the exclusive scope is created, all users are immediately blocked from modifying the recipients that match the exclusive scope until the scope is associated with a management role assignment. If other role assignments are associated with other exclusive scopes that match the same recipients, those assignments can still modify the recipients.

    The exclusive scope is then associated with a management role assignment that assigns the Mail Recipients management role to the Executive Administrators role group. This role group contains administrators who are allowed to modify the mailboxes of high-profile executives. Only the administrators of the Executive Administrators role group can modify users with the string "VP" in their title.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 5
  code: |-
    New-ManagementScope -Name "Seattle Databases" -DatabaseRestrictionFilter "Name -Like 'SEA*'"
  description: |-
    This example creates the Seattle Databases scope and sets a database restriction filter that matches only the databases that begin with the string "SEA".

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: DatabaseList
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DatabaseList parameter specifies a list of databases to which the scope should be applied. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can specify multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

    You can't use this parameter with the DatabaseRestrictionFilter, ServerList, RecipientRestrictionFilter, RecipientRoot, or ServerRestrictionFilter parameters.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DatabaseRestrictionFilter
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DatabaseRestrictionFilter parameter uses OPATH filter syntax to specify the databases that are included in the scope. The syntax is `"Property -ComparisonOperator 'Value'"`.

    - Enclose the whole OPATH filter in double quotation marks " ". If the filter contains system values (for example, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null`), use single quotation marks ' ' instead. Although this parameter is a string (not a system block), you can also use braces { }, but only if the filter doesn't contain variables.
    - Property is a filterable property. For a list of filterable database properties, see [Understanding management role scopes](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/understanding-management-role-scopes-exchange-2013-help).
    - ComparisonOperator is an OPATH comparison operator (for example `-eq` for equals and `-like` for string comparison). For more information about comparison operators, see [about_Comparison_Operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comparison_operators).
    - Value is the property value to search for. Enclose text values and variables in single quotation marks (`'Value'` or `'$Variable'`). If a variable value contains single quotation marks, you need to identify (escape) the single quotation marks to expand the variable correctly. For example, instead of `'$User'`, use `'$($User -Replace "'","''")'`. Don't enclose integers or system values in quotation marks (for example, use `500`, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null` instead).

    You can chain multiple search criteria together using the logical operators `-and` and `-or`. For example, `"Criteria1 -and Criteria2"` or `"(Criteria1 -and Criteria2) -or Criteria3"`.

    For detailed information about OPATH filters in Exchange, see [Additional OPATH syntax information](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/recipient-filters#additional-opath-syntax-information).

    You can't use this parameter with the RecipientRestrictionFilter, ServerRestrictionFilter, RecipientRoot, DatabaseList, or ServerList parameters.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  name: Exclusive
  description: |+
    The Exclusive switch specifies that the role should be an exclusive scope. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    When you create exclusive management scopes, only users or universal security groups (USG) assigned exclusive scopes that contain objects to be modified can access those objects. Users or USGs that aren't assigned an exclusive scope that contains the objects immediately lose access to those objects.
