### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is functional only in on-premises Exchange.

  **Note**: In Exchange Online, this cmdlet has been replaced by the [New-DlpFingerPrint](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/new-dlpfingerprint) cmdlet in Security & Compliance PowerShell.

  Use the New-Fingerprint cmdlet to create document fingerprints that are used with data classification rules. Because the results of New-Fingerprint are not stored outside of the data classification rule, you always run New-Fingerprint and New-DataClassification or Set-DataClassification in the same PowerShell session.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    $Patent_Template = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('C:\My Documents\Contoso Patent Template.docx')

    $Patent_Fingerprint = New-Fingerprint -FileData $Patent_Template -Description "Contoso Patent Template"
  description: |-
    This example creates a new document fingerprint based on the file C:\\My Documents\\Contoso Patent Template.docx. You store the new fingerprint as a variable so you can use it with the New-DataClassification cmdlet in the same PowerShell session.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: FileData
  description: |+
    The FileData parameter specifies the file to use as a document fingerprint.

    A valid value for this parameter requires you to read the file to a byte-encoded object using the following syntax: `([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('<Path>\<FileName>'))`. You can use this command as the parameter value, or you can write the output to a variable (`$data = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('<Path>\<FileName>')`) and use the variable as the parameter value (`$data`).

  name: WhatIf

    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
