# New-OabVirtualDirectory

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the New-OABVirtualDirectory cmdlet to create offline address book (OAB) virtual directories that are used in Internet Information Services (IIS) on Microsoft Exchange servers. The OAB virtual directory configures the server as a web distribution point for an offline address book (OAB). Typically, you create virtual directories on Exchange servers that have the Client Access server role installed.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
New-OabVirtualDirectory [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-ExtendedProtectionFlags <MultiValuedProperty>]
 [-ExtendedProtectionSPNList <MultiValuedProperty>] [-ExtendedProtectionTokenChecking <ExtendedProtectionTokenCheckingMode>]
 [-ExternalUrl <Uri>] [-InternalUrl <Uri>] [-Path <String>] [-PollInterval <Int32>] [-Recovery]
 [-RequireSSL <Boolean>] [-Server <ServerIdParameter>] [-WebSiteName <String>] [-WhatIf]
 [-Role <VirtualDirectoryRole>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The New-OABVirtualDirectory cmdlet configures a web distribution point for an OAB and creates the OAB virtual directory.

You have to manually create the file system folder on the server that hosts the OAB files.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
New-OABVirtualDirectory -Server CASServer01 -PollInterval 120
```

This example creates an OAB virtual directory on CASServer01 and configures the distribution service to poll the generation server every two hours.

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExtendedProtectionFlags
The ExtendedProtectionFlags parameter specifies custom settings for Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

- None: This is the default setting.

- AllowDotlessSPN: Required if you want to use Service Principal Name (SPN) values that don't contain FQDNs (for example, HTTP/ContosoMail instead of HTTP/mail.contoso.com). You specify SPNs with the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter. This setting makes Extended Protection for Authentication less secure because dotless certificates aren't unique, so it isn't possible to ensure that the client-to-proxy connection was established over a secure channel.

- NoServiceNameCheck: The SPN list isn't checked to validate a channel binding token. This setting makes Extended Protection for Authentication less secure. We generally don't recommend this setting.

- Proxy: A proxy server is responsible for terminating the SSL channel. To use this setting, you need to register an SPN by using the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.

- ProxyCoHosting: HTTP and HTTPS traffic may be accessing the virtual directory, and a proxy server is located between at least some of the clients and the Client Access services on the Exchange server.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExtendedProtectionSPNList
The ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter specifies a list of valid Service Principal Names (SPNs) if you're using Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

- $null: This is the default value.

- Single SPN or comma delimited list of valid SPNs: The SPN value format is \<protocol\>/\<FQDN\>. For example, HTTP/mail.contoso.com. To add an SPN that's not an FQDN (for example, HTTP/ContosoMail), you also need to use the AllowDotlessSPN value for the ExtendedProtectionFlags parameter.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExtendedProtectionTokenChecking
The ExtendedProtectionTokenChecking parameter defines how you want to use Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Extended Protection for Authentication isn't enabled by default. Valid values are:

- None: Extended Protection for Authentication isn't be used on the virtual directory. This is the default value.

- Allow: Extended Protection for Authentication is used for connections between clients and the virtual directory if both the client and server support it. Connections that don't support Extended Protection for Authentication will work, but may not be as secure as connections that use Extended Protection for Authentication.

- Require: Extended Protection for Authentication is used for all connections between clients and the virtual directory. If either the client or server doesn't support it, the connection will fail. If you use this value, you also need to set an SPN value for the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.

Note:

If you use the value Allow or Require, and you have a proxy server between the client and the Client Access services on the Mailbox server that's configured to terminate the client-to-proxy SSL channel, you also need to configure one or more Service Principal Names (SPNs) by using the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.
