# Update-PublicFolder

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

Use the Update-PublicFolder cmdlet to start content synchronization of a public folder.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Update-PublicFolder [-Identity] <PublicFolderIdParameter> -Server <ServerIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Update-PublicFolder "\Legal\Cases\My Public Folder" -Server "My Server"
```

This example starts content replication of the public folder My Public Folder in the \\Legal\\Cases path from the server My Server to all of the servers on the replication list for My Public Folder.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-PublicFolder "\Legal\Cases\My Public Folder" | Update-PublicFolder -Server "My Server"
```

This example also starts content replication of the public folder My Public Folder in the \\Legal\\Cases path from the server My Server to all of the servers on the replication list for My Public Folder, but uses the Get-PublicFolder cmdlet to pipeline the desired folder.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the GUID or public folder name that represents a specific public folder. You can also include the path by using the format TopLevelPublicFolder\\PublicFolder.

You can omit the parameter label so that only the public folder name or GUID is supplied.

```yaml
Type: PublicFolderIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Server
The Server parameter specifies the Mailbox server that holds the source public folder database for replication. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

- Name

- FQDN

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Exchange Legacy DN

```yaml
Type: ServerIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
