    The OrganizationGuid parameter specifies the on-premises organization in a hybrid deployment that has multiple on-premises organizations defined.

description: |-
  A hybrid Exchange deployment results in one logical organization made up of a number of physical Exchange instances. Hybrid Exchange environments contain more than one Exchange instance and support topologies like two on-premises Microsoft Exchange forests in an organization, an Exchange on-premises organization and an Exchange Online organization or two Exchange Online organizations.

  Hybrid environments are enabled by Intra-Organization connectors. The connectors can be created and managed by cmdlets like New-IntraOrganizationConnector, but we strongly recommend that you use the Hybrid Configuration wizard when configuring a hybrid deployment with an Exchange Online organization.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
