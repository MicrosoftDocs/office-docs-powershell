parameters:
- type: <xref href="MailboxRights" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: AccessRights
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The AccessRights parameter specifies the permission that you want to add for the user on the mailbox. Valid values are:

    - ChangeOwner
    - ChangePermission
    - DeleteItem
    - ExternalAccount
    - FullAccess
    - ReadPermission

    You can specify multiple values separated by commas.

    You can't use this parameter with the Owner parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AutoMapping
  description: |+
    The AutoMapping parameter includes or excludes the mailbox from the auto-mapping feature in Microsoft Outlook. Auto-mapping uses Autodiscover to automatically add mailboxes to a user's Outlook profile if the user has Full Access permission to the mailbox. However, Autodiscover won't enumerate security groups that are given Full Access permission to the mailbox. Valid values are:

    - $true: The mailbox is automatically added to the user's Outlook profile if the user has Full Access permission. This is the default value.
    - $false: The mailbox is not automatically added to the user's Outlook profile if the user has Full Access permission.

    **Note**: To disable auto-mapping for a mailbox where the user was already assigned Full Access permission, you need to remove the user's Full Access permission by using the Remove-MailboxPermission cmdlet, and then reassign the user Full Access permission on the mailbox using the AutoMapping parameter with the value $false.

  defaultValue: $true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Deny
  description: |+
    The Deny switch specifies that the permissions you're adding are Deny permissions. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GroupMailbox
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The GroupMailbox switch is required to add permissions to a Microsoft 365 Group mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox where you want to assign permissions to the user. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnoreDefaultScope
  description: |+
    The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange PowerShell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch enables the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope, but also introduces the following restrictions:

    - You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.
    - You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ActiveDirectorySecurityInheritance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InheritanceType
  description: |+
    The InheritanceType parameter specifies how permissions are inherited by folders in the mailbox. Valid values are:

    - None
    - All (this is the default value)
    - Children
    - Descendents [sic]
    - SelfAndChildren

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxAcePresentationObject" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Instance
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    This parameter has been deprecated and is no longer used.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SecurityPrincipalIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Owner
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Owner parameter specifies the owner of the mailbox object. You can specify the following types of users or groups (security principals) for this parameter:

    - Mailbox users
    - Mail users
    - Security groups

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the user or group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    The default mailbox owner is NT AUTHORITY\\SELF.

    You can't use this parameter with the AccessRights or User parameters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SecurityPrincipalIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: User
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The User parameter specifies who gets the permissions on the mailbox. You can specify the following types of users or groups (security principals) for this parameter:

    - Mailbox users
    - Mail users
    - Mail-enabled security groups (non-mail-enabled security groups are selectable, but they don't work)

    **Note**: When a mail-enabled security group is used to specify Full Access permissions, the auto-mapping feature won't automatically add the mailbox in Outlook for the group member. For more information, see [Mailboxes to which your account has full access aren't automapped to Outlook profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/outlook/troubleshoot/profiles-and-accounts/full-access-mailbox-not-automapped-outlook-profile).

    For the best results, we recommend using the following values:

    - UPN: For example, `user@contoso.com` (users only).
    - Domain\\SamAccountName: For example, `contoso\user`.

    Otherwise, you can use any value that uniquely identifies the user or group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    You can't use this parameter with the Owner parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can use this cmdlet to add a maximum of 500 permission entries (ACEs) to a mailbox. To grant permissions to more than 500 users, use security groups instead of individual users for the User parameter. Security groups contain many members, but only count as one entry.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
