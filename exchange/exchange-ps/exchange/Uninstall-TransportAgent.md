# Uninstall-TransportAgent

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Uninstall-TransportAgent cmdlet to unregister transport agents from Exchange servers.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Uninstall-TransportAgent [-Identity] <TransportAgentObjectId> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-WhatIf]
 [-TransportService <TransportService>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You can install and uninstall transport agents in the following locations:

- The Transport service on Mailbox servers.

- The Front End Transport service on Mailbox servers.

- Edge Transport servers.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Uninstall-TransportAgent "Test App" -TransportService Hub
```

This example uninstalls a fictitious application named Test App from the Transport service on a Mailbox server.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the display name of the transport agent that you want to uninstall. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks.

```yaml
Type: TransportAgentObjectId
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TransportService
The TransportService parameter specifies the transport service that you want to view or modify. Valid values for this parameter are:

- Hub for the Transport service on Mailbox servers.

- MailboxSubmission for the Mailbox Transport Submission service on Mailbox servers.

- MailboxDelivery for the Mailbox Transport Delivery service on Mailbox servers.

- FrontEnd for the Front End Transport service on Mailbox servers.

- Edge on Edge Transport servers.

```yaml
Type: TransportService
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
