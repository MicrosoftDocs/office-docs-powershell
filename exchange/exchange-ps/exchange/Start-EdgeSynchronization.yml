  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Start-EdgeSynchronization cmdlet to immediately start synchronization of configuration data from Active Directory to the subscribed Edge Transport servers.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForceFullSync
  description: |+
    The ForceFullSync switch specifies whether to initiate a full edge synchronization. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you don't use this switch, only changes since the last replication are synchronized. If you use this switch, the entire configuration information and recipient data are synchronized.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForceUpdateCookie
  description: |+
    The ForceUpdateCookie switch specifies whether to force the Microsoft Exchange EdgeSync service to update the replication cookie even if it encounters an error. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    The cookie maintains the changes in Active Directory since the previous EdgeSync replication. Normally, the Microsoft Exchange EdgeSync service doesn't update the cookie if it encounters any errors during replication.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    The Server parameter specifies the Exchange server where you want to run this command. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Exchange Legacy DN

    If you don't use this parameter, the command is run on the local server.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TargetServer
  description: |+
    The TargetServer parameter specifies an Edge Transport server to initiate edge synchronization with. If omitted, all Edge Transport servers are synchronized.

    You may want to use this parameter to specify a single Edge Transport server for synchronization if a new Edge Transport server has been installed or if that Edge Transport server has been unavailable for some time.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Start-EdgeSynchronization
name: Start-EdgeSynchronization
description: |-
  The Microsoft Exchange EdgeSync service that runs on Mailbox servers replicates data stored in Active Directory to the local Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) store on the Edge Transport server. After the initial replication, one-way synchronization of changed data in Active Directory to AD LDS keeps this data up to date.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
