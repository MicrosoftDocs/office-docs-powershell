  name: CallAnsweringAudioCodec

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: cf

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016

  name: DomainController
  description: |+

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnoreDefaultScope
  description: |+
    The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange PowerShell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch enables the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope, but also introduces the following restrictions:

    - You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.
    - You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ImListMigrationCompleted
  description: |+
    The ImListMigrationCompleted parameter specifies whether the UM-enabled user's Lync or Skype for Business contact list is stored in their mailbox.

    Valid values are:

    - $true: The user's Lync or Skype for Business contact list is stored in their Exchange 2016 mailbox. This prevents you from migrating the mailbox back to an Exchange 2010 server.
    - $false: The user's Lync or Skype for Business contact list is stored on a Lync or Skype for Business server. This doesn't prevent you from migrating the mailbox back to an Exchange 2010 server. This is the default value.

    Lync Server 2013 and Skype for Business Server 2015 support storing the user's contact list in their Exchange 2016 mailbox. This feature is known as the unified contact store (UCS), and it allows applications to show a consistent, up-to-date contact list. However, Exchange 2010 doesn't support the unified contact store. Therefore, before you migrate a user's Exchange 2016 mailbox back to Exchange 2010, you need to move the user's Lync or Skype for Business contact list from the unified contact store back to a Lync 2013 or Skype for Business server. For more information, see [Configuring Microsoft Lync Server 2013 to use the unified contact store](https://learn.microsoft.com/lyncserver/lync-server-2013-configuring-lync-server-to-use-the-unified-contact-store).

    If you migrate an Exchange 2013 mailbox back to Exchange 2010 while the user's Lync or Skype for Business contact list is stored in the unified contact store, the user could permanently lose access to those contacts. After you verify the user's Lync or Skype for Business contact list has been moved back to a Lync 2013 or Skype for Business server, you should be able to complete the mailbox migration. If you need to migrate the mailbox despite the potential for data loss, you can manually set the ImListMigrationCompleted parameter to $false.

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MissedCallNotificationEnabled
  description: |+
    The MissedCallNotificationEnabled parameter specifies whether to send missed call notifications.

    When you're integrating Unified Messaging and Lync Server or Skype for Business Server, missed call notifications aren't available to users who have mailboxes located on Exchange 2010 Mailbox servers. A missed call notification is generated when a user disconnects before the call is sent to a Mailbox server.

  name: PinlessAccessToVoiceMailEnabled

  The Set-UMMailbox cmdlet sets UM properties associated with a user who has been UM-enabled. Many of the UM properties for the user are stored on the user's mailbox, and other UM properties for the user are stored in Active Directory.

  After this task is completed, the parameters and values specified are configured on the UM mailbox.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
