### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

  Use the Start-RetentionAutoTagLearning cmdlet to start auto-tagging for a specified mailbox or to cross-validate auto-tagging results for the mailbox.

  Messaging records management (MRM) must be configured before the Start-RetentionAutoTagLearning cmdlet can be used. For more information, see [Understanding Retention Tags and Retention Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2010/dd297955(v=exchg.141)).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Clear
  description: |+
    The Clear switch specifies whether to clear auto-tags from the specified mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CrossValidate
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The CrossValidate switch specifies whether items in the specified mailbox are being auto-tagged. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter identifies the mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NumberOfSegments
  description: |+
    The NumberOfSegments parameter specifies the number of segments. Auto-tagging divides a mailbox into the number of segments specified and learns tagging behavior from n-1 segments. Tags are then predicted for items in the remaining segment based on this behavior. This is done for each segment.

    The default value is 10.

    The minimum value is 2.

    You csn only use this parameter with the CrossValidate parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Train
  description: |+
    The Train switch specifies whether to start the training algorithm for auto-tagging on the specified mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch is especially useful for retraining.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
