# Set-MailboxRestoreRequest

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Set-MailboxRestoreRequest cmdlet to change restore request options after the request has been created. You can use this cmdlet to recover from failed restore requests.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
Set-MailboxRestoreRequest -Identity "Ayla\MailboxRestore1" -BadItemLimit 10
```

This example changes the second restore request for Ayla\\MailboxRestore1 to skip 10 corrupt mailbox items.

### Example 2
```
Set-MailboxRestoreRequest -Identity "Kweku\MailboxRestore" -BadItemLimit 100 -AcceptLargeDataLoss
```

This example changes the first restore request for Kweku's mailbox to skip 100 corrupt items. Because the BadItemLimit is greater than 50, the AcceptLargeDataLoss parameter must be specified.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the identity of the restore request. The Identity parameter consists of the alias of the mailbox to be restored and the name that was specified when the restore request was created. The identity of the restore request uses the following syntax: \<alias\>\\\<name\>

If you didn't specify a name for the restore request when it was created, Exchange automatically generated the default name MailboxRestore. Exchange generates up to 10 names, starting with MailboxRestore and then MailboxRestoreX (where X = 1-9).

```yaml
Type: MailboxRestoreRequestIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AcceptLargeDataLoss
The AcceptLargeDataLoss switch specifies the request should continue even if a large number of items in the source mailbox can't be copied to the target mailbox. You need to use this switch if you set either the BadItemLimit or LargeItemLimit parameters to a value of 51 or higher. Otherwise, the command will fail.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All), Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BadItemLimit
The BadItemLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of bad items that are allowed before the request fails. A bad item is a corrupt item in the source mailbox that can't be copied to the target mailbox. Also included in the bad item limit are missing items. Missing items are items in the source mailbox that can't be found in the target mailbox when the request is ready to complete.

Valid input for this parameter is an integer or the value unlimited. The default value is 0, which means the request will fail if any bad items are detected. If you are OK with leaving a few bad items behind, you can set this parameter to a reasonable value (we recommend 10 or lower) so the request can proceed. If too many bad items are detected, consider using the New-MailboxRepairRequest cmdlet to attempt to fix corrupted items in the source mailbox, and try the request again.

If you set this value to 51 or higher, you also need to use the AcceptLargeDataLoss switch. Otherwise, the command will fail.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All), Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BatchName
The BatchName parameter specifies the name of the batch. Use this parameter to change, create, or remove a batch name.

To remove a batch name, set the BatchName parameter value to an empty string or to null, for example, -BatchName "" or -BatchName $null.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All), Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Priority
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The Priority parameter specifies the order in which the request should be processed in the request queue. Requests are processed in order, based on server health, status, priority, and last update time. Valid priority values are:

- Lowest

- Lower

- Low

- Normal: This is the default value.

- High

- Higher

- Highest

- Emergency

```yaml
Type: Normal | High
Parameter Sets: (All), Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RehomeRequest
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The RehomeRequest switch specifies that the mailbox restore request be moved to a different mailbox database. Use this parameter to edit a mailbox restore request in the case where the source mailbox database from the original move request has to be removed.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Set2
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CompletedRequestAgeLimit
The CompletedRequestAgeLimit parameter specifies how long the status of a completed restore request is set to Completed. If this parameter is set to a value of 0, the status is cleared immediately instead of changing it to Completed.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InternalFlags
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The InternalFlags parameter specifies the optional steps in the request. This parameter is used primarily for debugging purposes.

```yaml
Type: InternalMrsFlag[]
Parameter Sets: Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LargeItemLimit
The LargeItemLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of large items that are allowed before the request fails. A large item is a message in the source mailbox that exceeds the maximum message size that's allowed in the target mailbox. If the target mailbox doesn't have a specifically configured maximum message size value, the organization-wide value is used.

For more information about maximum message size values, see the following topics:

- Exchange 2016: Message size limits in Exchange 2016 (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb124345.aspx)

- Exchange Online: Exchange Online Limits (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=524926)

Valid input for this parameter is an integer or the value unlimited. The default value is 0, which means the request will fail if any large items are detected. If you are OK with leaving a few large items behind, you can set this parameter to a reasonable value (we recommend 10 or lower) so the request can proceed.

If you set this value to 51 or higher, you also need to use the AcceptLargeDataLoss switch. Otherwise, the command will fail.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RemoteHostName
This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: Set2, Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SkipMerging
The SkipMerging parameter specifies folder-related items to skip when restoring the mailbox. Use one of the following values:

- FolderRules

- FolderACLs

- InitialConnectionValidation

Use this parameter only if a restore request fails because of folder rules, folder access control lists (ACLs), or initial connection validation.

```yaml
Type: SkippableMergeComponent[]
Parameter Sets: Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RequestExpiryInterval
The RequestExpiryInterval parameter specifies an age limit for a completed or failed request. When you use this parameter, the completed or failed request is automatically removed after the specified interval expires. If you don't use this parameter:

- The completed request is automatically removed based on the CompletedRequestAgeLimit parameter value.

- If the request fails, you need to manually remove it by using the corresponding Remove-\*Request cmdlet.

To specify a value, enter it as a time span: dd.hh:mm:ss where dd = days, hh = hours, mm = minutes and ss = seconds.

When you use the value Unlimited, the completed request isn't automatically removed.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: Set2, Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
