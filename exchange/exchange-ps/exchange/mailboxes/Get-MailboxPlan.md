## DESCRIPTION
A mailbox plan is a template that automatically configures mailbox properties. Mailbox plans correspond to license types, and are applied when you license the user. The availability of a mailbox plan is determined by your selections when you enroll in the service and the age of your organization.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

### -AllMailboxPlanReleases
The AllMailboxPlanReleases switch specifies whether to include mailbox plans that were used in previous versions of the service in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

### -Credential
The Credential parameter specifies the user name and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.

This parameter requires the creation and passing of a credential object. This credential object is created by using the Get-Credential cmdlet. For more information, see Get-Credential (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=142122).
