# Resume-MailboxExportRequest

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Resume-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet to resume an export request that was suspended or failed.

This cmdlet is available only in the Mailbox Import Export role and by default, the role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use this cmdlet, you need to add the Mailbox Import Export role to a role group (for example, to the Organization Management role group). For more information, see the "Add a role to a role group" section in Manage role groups (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj657480.aspx).

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Resume-MailboxExportRequest [-Identity] <MailboxExportRequestIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Resume-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet can be pipelined with the Get-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Resume-MailboxExportRequest -Identity kweku\export
```

This example resumes the export request kweku\\export.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-MailboxExportRequest -Status Failed | Resume-MailboxExportRequest
```

This example resumes any failed export move requests.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the identity of the export request. By default, export requests are named \<alias\>\\MailboxExportX (where X = 0-9). Use the following syntax: \<alias\>\\\<name\>.

```yaml
Type: MailboxExportRequestIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016
Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
