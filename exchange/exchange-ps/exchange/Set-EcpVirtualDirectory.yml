### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Set-EcpVirtualDirectory cmdlet to modify Exchange Control Panel (ECP) virtual directories that are used in Internet Information Services (IIS) on Microsoft Exchange servers. The ECP virtual directory manages the Exchange admin center.

  The ECP web management interface was introduced in Exchange Server 2010. In Exchange Server 2013 and Exchange Server 2016, the EAC virtual directories and the corresponding management cmdlets still use ECP in the name. You can use these cmdlets to manage ECP virtual directories on Exchange 2010, Exchange 2013, and Exchange 2016 servers.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AdfsAuthentication
  description: |+
    The AdfsAuthentication parameter specifies that the ECP virtual directory allows users to authenticate through Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) authentication. This parameter accepts $true or $false. The default value is $false.

    The ADFS authentication settings for Set-OwaVirtualDirectory and Set-EcpVirtualDirectory are related. You need to set the AdfsAuthentication parameter on Set-EcpVirtualDirectory to $true before you can set the AdfsAuthentication parameter on Set-OwaVirtualDirectory to $true. Likewise, you need to set the AdfsAuthentication parameter on Set-OwaVirtualDirectory to $false before you can set the AdfsAuthentication parameter on Set-EcpVirtualDirectory to $false.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AdminEnabled
  description: |+
    The AdminEnabled parameter specifies that the EAC isn't able to be accessed through the Internet. For more information, see [Turn off access to the Exchange admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/architecture/client-access/disable-exchange-admin-center-access). This parameter accepts $true or $false.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BasicAuthentication
  description: |+
    The BasicAuthentication parameter specifies whether Basic authentication is enabled on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

    - $true: Basic authentication is enabled. This is the default value.
    - $false: Basic authentication is disabled.

    This parameter can be used with the FormsAuthentication parameter or with the DigestAuthentication and WindowsAuthentication parameters.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DigestAuthentication
  description: |+
    The DigestAuthentication parameter specifies whether Digest authentication is enabled on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

    - $true: Digest authentication is enabled.
    - $false: Digest authentication is disabled. This is the default value.

- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExtendedProtectionFlags
  description: |+
    The ExtendedProtectionFlags parameter specifies custom settings for Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

    - None: This is the default setting.
    - AllowDotlessSPN: Required if you want to use Service Principal Name (SPN) values that don't contain FQDNs (for example, HTTP/ContosoMail instead of HTTP/mail.contoso.com). You specify SPNs with the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter. This setting makes Extended Protection for Authentication less secure because dotless certificates aren't unique, so it isn't possible to ensure that the client-to-proxy connection was established over a secure channel.
    - NoServiceNameCheck: The SPN list isn't checked to validate a channel binding token. This setting makes Extended Protection for Authentication less secure. We generally don't recommend this setting.
    - Proxy: A proxy server is responsible for terminating the SSL channel. To use this setting, you need to register an SPN by using the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.
    - ProxyCoHosting: HTTP and HTTPS traffic may be accessing the virtual directory, and a proxy server is located between at least some of the clients and the Client Access services on the Exchange server.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExtendedProtectionSPNList
  description: |+
    The ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter specifies a list of valid Service Principal Names (SPNs) if you're using Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

    - $null: This is the default value.
    - Single SPN or comma delimited list of valid SPNs: The SPN value format is `Protocol\FQDN`. For example, HTTP/mail.contoso.com. To add an SPN that's not an FQDN (for example, HTTP/ContosoMail), you also need to use the AllowDotlessSPN value for the ExtendedProtectionFlags parameter.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ExtendedProtectionTokenCheckingMode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExtendedProtectionTokenChecking
  description: |+
    The ExtendedProtectionTokenChecking parameter defines how you want to use Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Extended Protection for Authentication isn't enabled by default. Valid values are:

    - None: Extended Protection for Authentication isn't be used on the virtual directory. This is the default value.
    - Allow: Extended Protection for Authentication is used for connections between clients and the virtual directory if both the client and server support it. Connections that don't support Extended Protection for Authentication will work, but may not be as secure as connections that use Extended Protection for Authentication.
    - Require: Extended Protection for Authentication is used for all connections between clients and the virtual directory. If either the client or server doesn't support it, the connection will fail. If you use this value, you also need to set an SPN value for the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.

    **Note**: If you use the value Allow or Require, and you have a proxy server between the client and the Client Access services on the Mailbox server that's configured to terminate the client-to-proxy SSL channel, you also need to configure one or more Service Principal Names (SPNs) by using the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the ECP virtual directory that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the virtual directory. For example:

    - Name or Server\\Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    The Name value uses the syntax `"VirtualDirectoryName (WebsiteName)"` from the properties of the virtual directory. You can specify the wildcard character (\*) instead of the default website by using the syntax `VirtualDirectoryName*`.

    To manage the first ECP virtual directory created in an Exchange organization, you need to use this cmdlet on the computer that includes the first ECP virtual directory. If you create additional ECP virtual directories, you can manage those remotely.
