# Add-eDiscoveryCaseAdmin

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in Security & Compliance PowerShell. For more information, see [Security & Compliance PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/scc-powershell).

Use the Add-eDiscoveryCaseAdmin cmdlet to add an eDiscovery Administrator in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. To replace all existing eDiscovery Administrators, use the Update-eDiscoveryCaseAdmin cmdlet.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Add-eDiscoveryCaseAdmin -User <String>
 [-Confirm]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
An eDiscovery Administrator is member of the eDiscovery Manager role group who can also view and access all eDiscovery cases in your organization.

To make a user an eDiscovery Administrator, you must first add the user to the eDiscovery Manager role group by running the Add-RoleGroupMember cmdlet. After the user is a member of this role group, you can run the Add-eDiscoveryCaseAdmin cmdlet to add the user to the list of eDiscovery Administrators.

To use this cmdlet in Security & Compliance PowerShell, you need to be assigned permissions. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Add-eDiscoveryCaseAdmin -User michelle@contoso.com
```

This example adds an eDiscovery Administrator.

## PARAMETERS

### -User
The User parameter specifies the user that you want to add to the list of eDiscovery Administrators. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the user. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- Canonical DN
- GUID

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch doesn't work in Security & Compliance PowerShell.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
