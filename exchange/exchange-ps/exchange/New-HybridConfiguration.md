# New-HybridConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the New-HybridConfiguration cmdlet to create the HybridConfiguration object and set up a hybrid deployment between your on-premises Exchange organization and a Microsoft Office 365 for enterprises organization.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## DESCRIPTION
A hybrid deployment offers organizations the ability to extend the feature-rich experience and administrative control they have with their existing on-premises Microsoft Exchange organization to the cloud. The New-HybridConfiguration cmdlet is used with the Hybrid Configuration wizard and is typically configured when the hybrid deployment is initially created by the wizard. We strongly recommend that you use the Hybrid Configuration wizard to create the HybridConfiguration object and configure your hybrid deployment with the Exchange Online organization.

For more information, see Exchange Server Hybrid Deployments (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj200581.aspx).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
New-HybridConfiguration
```

This example creates the hybrid configuration Hybrid Configuration with the default hybrid configuration settings.

## PARAMETERS

### -ClientAccessServers
This parameter is available or functional only in Exchange Server 2010.

The ClientAccessServers parameter specifies the Exchange Server 2010 SP2 servers with the Client Access server role installed that will be configured to support the hybrid deployment features. At least one Client Access server must be defined and be externally accessible from the Internet on ports 80 and 443. The servers will be configured to enable the following:

- Mailbox Replication Service (MRS) Proxy The MRS Proxy service configuration on the Client Access servers will be enabled.

- Virtual Directories The Client Access servers will host the default Web sites for the Exchange Web Services (EWS), offline address books, and ActiveSync services.

- Outlook Anywhere The Client Access servers will have Outlook Anywhere enabled.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Domains
The Domains parameter specifies the domain namespaces that are used in the hybrid deployment. These domains must be configured as accepted domains in either the on-premises Exchange organization or the Exchange Online service. The domains are used in configuring the organization relationships and Send and Receive connectors used by the hybrid configuration.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExternalIPAddresses
The ExternalIPAddresses parameter is a legacy parameter that specifies the publicly accessible inbound IP address of Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Hub Transport servers. The only configuration change that should be made with this parameter is to change or clear the legacy Exchange 2010 Hub Transport server IP address value. The IP address must be Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) based only.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Features
The Features parameter specifies the features that are enabled for the hybrid configuration. One or more of the following values separated by commas can be entered. When using the Hybrid Configuration wizard, all features are enabled by default.

- OnlineArchive: Enables the Exchange Online archive for on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online organization users.

- FreeBusy: Enables free/busy calendar information to be shared between on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online organization users.

- MailTips: Enables MailTips information to be shared between on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online organization users.

- MessageTracking: Enables message tracking information to be shared between on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online organization users.

- OWARedirection: Enables automatic Microsoft Outlook on the web redirection to either the on-premises Exchange or Exchange Online organizations depending on where the user mailbox is located.

- SecureMail: Enables secure message transport via Transport Layer Security (TLS) between the on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online organizations.

- Centralized: Enables the on-premises servers to handle all message transport between the on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online organizations, including message delivering to the Internet for both organizations. If this value is $false, the on-premises server and Exchange Online organization are each responsible for their own Internet message delivery.

- Photos: Enables the sharing of user photo data between the on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online organizations. This feature works in tandem with the PhotosEnabled parameter in the OrganizationRelationship cmdlets in a hybrid deployment. If the Photos parameter is $true, the PhotosEnabled parameter is automatically set to $true. If the Photos parameter is $false, the PhotosEnabled parameter is automatically set to $false. When running the Hybrid Configuration wizard for the first time, the default value is $true.

```

### -ServiceInstance
The ServiceInstance parameter should only be used by organizations manually configuring hybrid deployments with Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China. All other organizations should use the Hybrid Configuration wizard to configure a hybrid deployment with Office 365. The valid values for this parameter are 0 (null) or 1. The default value is 0 (null).For organizations connecting with Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China, set this value to 1 when manually configuring your hybrid deployment.
