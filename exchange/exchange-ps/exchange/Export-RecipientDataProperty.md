## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Export-RecipientDataProperty -Identity tony@contoso.com -SpokenName | ForEach { $_.FileData | Add-Content C:\tonysmith.wma -Encoding Byte}
```

This example exports Tony Smith's spoken name audio file and saves it to the local computer.

### Example 2
```powershell
Export-RecipientDataProperty -Identity "Ayla" -Picture | ForEach { $_.FileData | Add-Content C:\aylakol.jpg -Encoding Byte}
```

This example exports Ayla Kol's picture file to the local computer.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox or mail contact from which you want to export the recipient data. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the user. For example:

- Name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- Email address

- GUID

```yaml
Type: MailboxUserContactIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Picture
The Picture switch specifies that the file you're exporting is the user's picture file. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

You can't use this switch with the SpokenName switch. You can only export one file type at a time.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ExportPicture
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SpokenName
The SpokenName switch specifies that the file you're exporting is the user's audio file. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

This cmdlet exports the WMA 9-voice format. You can't use this switch with the Picture switch. You can only export one file type at a time.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ExportSpokenName
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
