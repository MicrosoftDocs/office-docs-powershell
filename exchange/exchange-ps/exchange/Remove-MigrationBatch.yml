  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Remove-MigrationBatch cmdlet to delete a migration batch that either isn't running or has been completed. If necessary, you can run the Get-MigrationBatch cmdlet to determine the status of a migration batch before you remove it.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    Use this switch to remove a corrupted migration batch. Corrupted migration batches have a status of Corrupted. If you try to remove a corrupted migration batch without using this switch, you receive an error saying the migrated batch can't be found.

    If you use this switch to remove a corrupted migration batch, the individual user requests (also called job items) and subscriptions that were part of the removed migration batch aren't removed. You need to remove the individual migration user requests with the command: `Remove-MigrationUser <Identity> -Force`.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MigrationBatchIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter identifies the migration batch that you want to remove. The value for this parameter is the name that was specified when the migration batch was created.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf

  The Remove-MigrationBatch cmdlet removes a migration batch. All subscriptions are deleted and any object related to the migration batch is also deleted.

  If you use the Force switch with this cmdlet, the individual user requests and subscriptions that were part of the removed migration batch aren't removed. You need to remove the individual migration user requests with the command: `Remove-MigrationUser <Identity> -Force`.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
