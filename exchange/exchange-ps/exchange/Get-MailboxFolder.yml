parameters:
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox folder that you want to view. The syntax is `[MailboxID]:[\ParentFolder][\SubFolder]`.

    You can only run this cmdlet on your own mailbox, so you don't need to (or can't) specify a `MailboxID` value.

    For the value of `MailboxID`, you can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    If you don't specify the folder, the command returns information about folders in the root hierarchy of the specified mailbox.

    Example values for this parameter are `john@contoso.com:`, `John:\Inbox`.
