  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateSubject
  description: |+
    The CertificateSubject parameter specifies the value of the subject field of the user's digital certificate. The syntax of the CertificateSubject value is `X509:<I>Issuer<S>Subject`. The values of Issuer and Subject are required and must be in X.500 format. To remove the value of CertificateSubject, specify the value $null.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
