  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: Name
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies a new value for the Name property of the recovered mailbox. Otherwise, the original value is retained when the mailbox is recovered. The new name value is also used in the DistinguishedName property.

  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SecureString" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Password
  description: |+
    The Password parameter specifies a new password for the mailbox.

    You can use the following methods as a value for this parameter:

    - `(ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<password>' -AsPlainText -Force)`.
    - Before you run this command, store the password as a variable (for example, `$password = Read-Host "Enter password" -AsSecureString`), and then use the variable (`$password`) for the value.
    - `(Get-Credential).password` to be prompted to enter the password securely when you run this command.

    You have to include the Password parameter to recover a deleted mailbox with an existing Microsoft account (formerly known as a Windows Live ID) that wasn't deleted with the mailbox.

description: |-
  Use the Undo-SoftDeletedMailbox cmdlet to recover a mailbox that has been deleted. When a mailbox is deleted with the Remove-Mailbox or Disable-Mailbox cmdlet, it's not actually deleted. It's hidden in Exchange and moved in Active Directory to the organizational unit (OU) Soft Deleted Objects. This enables administrators to recover deleted mailboxes for up to 30 days after deletion.

  If the Microsoft account (formerly known as a Windows Live ID) wasn't deleted when the mailbox was deleted, you have to specify a new Microsoft account and password when you use the Undo-SoftDeletedMailbox cmdlet to recover a mailbox.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
