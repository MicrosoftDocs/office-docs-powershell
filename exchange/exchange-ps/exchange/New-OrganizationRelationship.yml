### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the New-OrganizationRelationship cmdlet to create organization relationships. Organization relationships define the settings that are used with external Exchange organizations to access calendar free/busy information or to move mailboxes between on-premises Exchange servers and Exchange Online as part of hybrid deployments.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  code: |-
    Get-FederationInformation -DomainName Contoso.com | New-OrganizationRelationship -Name "Contoso" -FreeBusyAccessEnabled $true -FreeBusyAccessLevel LimitedDetails
  description: |-
    This example creates an organization relationship with Contoso. The domain name to connect to is contoso.com. The following settings are used:

    Free/busy access is enabled.

    The requesting organization receives time, subject, and location information from the target organization.

    This example attempts to automatically discover configuration information from the external organization by using the domain names provided in the Get-FederationInformation command. If you use this method to create your organization relationship, you must first ensure that you've created an organization identifier by using the Set-FederationOrganizationIdentifier cmdlet.

  code: |-
    New-OrganizationRelationship -Name "Fourth Coffee" -DomainNames "mail.fourthcoffee.com" -FreeBusyAccessEnabled $true -FreeBusyAccessLevel AvailabilityOnly -TargetAutodiscoverEpr "https://mail.fourthcoffee.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.svc/wssecurity" -TargetApplicationUri "mail.fourthcoffee.com"
  description: |-
    This example creates the organization relationship with Fourth Coffee using the following settings. In this example, the connection settings with the external organization are provided.

    The domain to connect to is mail.fourthcoffee.com.

    The Exchange Web Services application URL is mail.fourthcoffee.com.

    The Autodiscover URL is `https://mail.fourthcoffee.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.svc/wssecurity`.

    Free/busy access is enabled.

    The requesting organization only receives free/busy information with the time.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ArchiveAccessEnabled
  description: |+
    The ArchiveAccessEnabled parameter specifies whether the organization relationship has been configured to provide remote archive access. Valid values are:

    - $true: The external organization provides remote access to mailbox archives.
    - $false: The external organization doesn't provide remote access to mailbox archives. This is the default value.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DeliveryReportEnabled
  description: |+
    The DeliveryReportEnabled parameter specifies whether Delivery Reports should be shared over the organization relationship. Valid values are:

    - $true: Delivery Reports should be shared over the organization relationship. This value means the organization has agreed to share all Delivery Reports with the external organization, and the organization relationship should be used to retrieve Delivery Report information from the external organization.
    - $false: Delivery Reports shouldn't be shared over the organization relationship. This is the default value

    For message tracking to work in a cross-premises Exchange scenario, this parameter must be set to $true on both sides of the organization relationship. If the value of this parameter is set to $false on one or both sides of the organization relationship, message tracking between the organizations won't work in either direction.
