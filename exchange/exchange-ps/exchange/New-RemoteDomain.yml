### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the New-RemoteDomain cmdlet to create a managed connection for a remote domain. When you create a remote domain, you can control mail flow with more precision, apply message formatting and messaging policies and specify acceptable character sets for messages sent to and received from the remote domain.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

- type: <xref href="SmtpDomainWithSubdomains" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The DomainName parameter specifies the SMTP domain that you want to establish as a remote domain. A valid value is an SMTP domain (for example, contoso.com). The maximum length is 256 characters.

    You can use the wildcard character (\*) to specify a domain and all subdomains (for example: \*.contoso.com), but you can't embed the wildcard character (for example, domain.\*.contoso.com).
