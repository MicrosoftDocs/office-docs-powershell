# Set-QuarantinePermissions

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Set-QuarantinePermissions cmdlet to modify quarantine permissions objects that are used in quarantine tags (the New-QuarantineTag or Set-QuarantineTag cmdlets). This cmdlet only works on permissions objects that were created by the New-QuarantinePermissions cmdlet and stored in a variable that's currently available in the Windows PowerShell session.

**Note**: We recommend that you use the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. For instructions, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-QuarantinePermissions -QuarantinePermissionsObject <QuarantinePermissions>
 [-PermissionToAllowSender <Boolean>]
 [-PermissionToBlockSender <Boolean>]
 [-PermissionToDelete <Boolean>]
 [-PermissionToDownload <Boolean>]
 [-PermissionToPreview <Boolean>]
 [-PermissionToRelease <Boolean>]
 [-PermissionToRequestRelease <Boolean>]
 [-PermissionToViewHeader <Boolean>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
To see the current value of the permissions object that you want to modify, run the variable name as a command. For example, run the command `$Perms` to see the quarantine tag permissions stored in the `$Perms` variable.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-QuarantinePermissions -QuarantinePermissionsObject $Perms -PermissionToRequestRelease $true -PermissionToRelease $false
```

This example modifies the specified quarantine tag permissions in the exiting `$Perms` permissions object that was created previously in the same Windows PowerShell session (the `$Perms` variable is still available and populated).

In the same Windows PowerShell session, you can use `$Perms` for the _EndUserQuarantinePermissions_ parameter value in a New-QuarantineTag or Set-QuarantineTag command.

## PARAMETERS

### -QuarantinePermissionsObject
The QuarantinePermissionsObject parameter specifies the variable that contains quarantine permissions object that you want to modify. For example if you ran the command `$Perms = New-QuarantinePermissions <permissions>`, use the value `$Perms` for this parameter.
