### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

  **Note**: If the policy already exists (the Get-TeamsProtectionPolicy cmdlet returns output), you can't use this cmdlet.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: HighConfidencePhishQuarantineTag
  description: |+
    The HighConfidencePhishQuarantineTag parameter specifies the quarantine policy that's used for messages that are quarantined as high confidence phishing by ZAP for Teams. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the quarantine policy. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    Quarantine policies define what users are able to do to quarantined messages, and whether users receive quarantine notifications. For more information about quarantine policies, see [Quarantine policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/quarantine-policies).

    If you don't use this parameter, the default quarantine policy that's used is named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy. For more information about this quarantine policy, see [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/quarantine-policies#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).
