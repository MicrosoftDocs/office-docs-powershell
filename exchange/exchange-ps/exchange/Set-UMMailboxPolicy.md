# Set-UMMailboxPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Set-UMMailboxPolicy cmdlet to modify a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## DESCRIPTION
When the Set-UMMailboxPolicy cmdlet is used to modify UM mailbox policy objects, you can change settings such as PIN policies, message text settings, and dialing restrictions for a single UM-enabled recipient or multiple UM-enabled recipients. UM mailbox policies are associated with UM-enabled mailboxes and can be configured to increase the level of security for UM-enabled users.

After this task is completed, the parameters and values specified are configured on the UM mailbox policy.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -LogonFailuresBeforePINReset 8 -MaxLogonAttempts 12 -MinPINLength 8 -PINHistoryCount 10 -PINLifetime 60 -ResetPINText "The PIN used to allow you access to your mailbox using Outlook Voice Access has been reset."
```

This example sets the PIN settings for users associated with the UM mailbox policy MyUMMailboxPolicy.

### Example 2
```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowDialPlanSubscribers $true -AllowedInCountryOrRegionGroups InCountry/RegionGroup1,InCountry/RegionGroup2 -AllowedInternationalGroups InternationalGroup1,InternationalGroup2 -AllowExtensions $true
```

This example selects the in-country or region groups and international groups from those configured on the UM dial plan associated with the UM mailbox policy. UM-enabled users associated with this UM mailbox policy can place outbound calls according to the rules defined on these groups.

### Example 3
```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -UMEnabledText "You have been enabled for Unified Messaging." -VoiceMailText "You have received a voice mail message from Microsoft Exchange Unified Messaging."
```

This example configures the text of voice mail messages sent to UM-enabled users and the text included in an email message sent to a user who is UM-enabled.

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

### -ProtectAuthenticatedVoiceMail
The ProtectAuthenticatedVoiceMail parameter specifies whether Mailbox servers that answer Outlook Voice Access calls for UM-enabled users associated with the UM mailbox policy create protected voice mail messages.
