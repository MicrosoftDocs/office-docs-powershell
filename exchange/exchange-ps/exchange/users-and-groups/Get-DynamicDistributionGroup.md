## DESCRIPTION
A dynamic distribution group queries mail-enabled objects and builds the group membership based on the results. The group membership is recalculated whenever an email message is sent to the group.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-DynamicDistributionGroup
```

This example returns a summary list of all dynamic distribution groups in your organization.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-DynamicDistributionGroup -Identity "Marketing Department" | Format-List
```

This example returns detailed information about the dynamic distribution group named Marketing Department.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-DynamicDistributionGroup -Anr *research* | Format-Table Name, ManagedBy -Auto
```

This example returns all dynamic distribution groups whose names contain the string "research" and shows the group owners.

### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```
$FTE = Get-DynamicDistributionGroup "Full Time Employees"; Get-Recipient -RecipientPreviewFilter $FTE.RecipientFilter -OrganizationalUnit $FTE.RecipientContainer
```

This example returns the members for the dynamic distribution group named Full Time Employees. The first command stores the dynamic distribution group object in the variable $FTE. The second command uses the Get-Recipient cmdlet to list the recipients that match the criteria defined for the dynamic distribution group.

## PARAMETERS

### -Anr
The Anr parameter specifies a string on which to perform an ambiguous name resolution (ANR) search. You can specify a partial string and search for objects with an attribute that matches that string. The default attributes searched are:

- CommonName (CN)

- DisplayName

- FirstName

- LastName

- Alias

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: AnrSet
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.

A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see Get-Credential (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=142122).

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter
The Filter parameter indicates the OPath filter used to filter recipients.

For more information about the filterable properties, see Filterable properties for the -Filter parameter (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb738155.aspx).

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the dynamic distribution group that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the dynamic distribution group. For example:

- Name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- Email address

- GUID

```yaml
Type: DynamicGroupIdParameter
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IgnoreDefaultScope
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope.

Using the IgnoreDefaultScope switch introduces the following restrictions:

- You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.

- You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IncludeSystemObjects
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ManagedBy
The ManagedBy parameter filters the results by the owner of the group. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the owner. For example:

- Name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- Email address

- GUID

```yaml
Type: GeneralRecipientIdParameter
Parameter Sets: ManagedBySet
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OrganizationalUnit
The OrganizationalUnit parameter filters the results based on the object's location in Active Directory. Only objects that exist in the specified location are returned. Valid input for this parameter is an organizational unit (OU) or domain that's visible using the Get-OrganizationalUnit cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OU or domain. For example:

- Name

- Canonical name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

```yaml
Type: OrganizationalUnitIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ReadFromDomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The ReadFromDomainController switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you run the command Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true to include all objects in the forest and you don't use the ReadFromDomainController switch, it's possible that information will be read from a global catalog that has outdated information. When you use the ReadFromDomainController switch, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information. You don't have to specify a value with this switch.

By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResultSize
The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SortBy
The SortBy parameter specifies the property to sort the results by. You can sort by only one property at a time. The results are sorted in ascending order.

If the default view doesn't include the property you're sorting by, you can append the command with | Format-Table -Auto \<Property1\>,\<Property2\>... to create a new view that contains all of the properties that you want to see. Wildcards (\*) in the property names are supported.

You can sort by the following properties:

- Name

- DisplayName

- Alias

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
