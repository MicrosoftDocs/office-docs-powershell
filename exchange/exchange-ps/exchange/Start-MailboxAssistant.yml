  code: |-
    Start-MailboxAssistant -Identity "Chris" -AssistantName BigFunnelRetryFeederTimeBasedAssistant
  description: |-
    This example starts the `BigFunnelRetryFeederTimeBasedAssistant` assistant and lets it process the mailbox of the user "Chris". The assistant indexes the mailbox items that were not indexed previously.

    **Note**: You first need to create a setting override as described in [Incomplete search results after installing an Exchange Server 2019 update](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/incomplete-search-results-after-installing-an-exchange-server-2019-update-96ae2ef0-4569-4327-8d0c-8a3c1abdc1f6).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssistantName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The AssistantName parameter specifies the assistant that should process the mailbox. Valid values are:

    - BigFunnelRetryFeederTimeBasedAssistant

    Values are case sensitive.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
