# Set-AcceptedDomain

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Set-AcceptedDomain cmdlet to modify existing accepted domains in your organization. An accepted domain is any SMTP namespace for which an Exchange organization sends and receives email.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-AcceptedDomain [-Identity] <AcceptedDomainIdParameter> [-AddressBookEnabled <Boolean>]
 [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-DomainType <AcceptedDomainType>]
 [-MakeDefault <Boolean>] [-Name <String>]
 [-OutboundOnly <Boolean>] [-PendingRemoval <Boolean>] [-WhatIf]
 [-EnableNego2Authentication <Boolean>] [-MatchSubDomains <Boolean>]
 [-PendingCompletion <Boolean>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-AcceptedDomain -Identity Contoso -MakeDefault $true
```

This example makes the accepted domain Contoso the default accepted domain.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the accepted domain you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the accepted domain object. For example, you can use the name, GUID or distinguished name (DN) of the accepted domain.

```yaml
Type: AcceptedDomainIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AddressBookEnabled
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The AddressBookEnabled parameter specifies whether to enable recipient filtering for this accepted domain. The default values are:

- $true for authoritative domains.

- $false for internal relay domains.

- $false for external relay domains.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainType
The DomainType parameter specifies the accepted domain type. Valid values are:

- Authoritative: This is the default value. Your organization is completely responsible for delivering email to recipients in the domain, and for generating non-delivery reports (also known as an NDRs, delivery system notifications, DSNs, or bounce messages) for unresolved recipients.

- InternalRelay: This is a type of non-authoritative domain. Your organization receives email that's sent to recipients in the domain, but the messages are relayed to an external messaging system that's under your control. The external messaging system is responsible for generating NDRs for unresolved recipients. Use this value to treat messages that are sent to the domain as internal messages.

- ExternalRelay: This is a type of non-authoritative domain that's available only in on-premises Exchange organizations. Your organization receives email that's sent to recipients in the domain, but the messages are relayed to an external messaging system that's completely outside of your control. The external messaging system is responsible for generating NDRs for unresolved recipients.

Note:

For the value InternalRelay or ExternalRelay you typically use mail users or mail contacts to relay the messages to the external messaging system. Address rewriting is also available on Edge Transport servers in on-premises Exchange organizations.

```yaml
Type: AcceptedDomainType
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MakeDefault
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The MakeDefault parameter specifies whether the accepted domain is the default domain. Valid values are: $true or $false.

- $true: The accepted domain is the default domain. This is the default value for first accepted domain that's created in the organization.

- $false: The accepted domain isn't the default domain. This the default value for subsequent accepted domains.

The default accepted domain is used in sender email addresses when the senders have only non-SMTP email addresses (for example, X.400 addresses). Non-SMTP email addresses are encapsulated in SMTP email addresses by using the Internet Mail Connector Encapsulated Address (IMCEA) encapsulation method. IMCEA encapsulation uses the default domain value in the SMTP email address.

If you don't use non-SMTP email addresses in your organization, you don't need to worry about the value of this parameter.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the accepted domain object. The default value is the DomainName property value. The maximum length is 64 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OutboundOnly
This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

The OutboundOnly parameter specifies whether this accepted domain is an internal relay domain for the on-premises deployment for organizations that have coexistence with a cloud-based organization.

The authoritative accepted domain for the on-premises deployment is configured as an internal relay accepted domain on the cloud side. If the on-premises deployment is using Exchange Online Protection, you need to set this parameter to $true for the accepted domain that represents your on-premises deployment. This parameter is used only if the DomainType parameter is set to Authoritative or InternalRelay. The default value is $false.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PendingRemoval
This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
