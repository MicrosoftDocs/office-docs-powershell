### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

  Use the Set-RoutingGroupConnector cmdlet to modify the properties of an existing routing group connector between a Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 routing group and an Exchange Server 2003 routing group. You can also use this cmdlet to configure the maximum message size that can pass across a routing group connector.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  code: |-
    Set-RoutingGroupConnector -Identity "Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)\Exchange Routing Group (DWBGZMFD01QNBJR)\Ex2010 to Ex2003 RGC" -Cost 70 -MaxMessageSize 10MB -SourceTransportServers 2010Hub1.contoso.com -TargetTransportServers 2003BH1.contoso.com
  description: |-
    This example makes the following configuration changes to the routing group connector Ex2010 to Ex2003 RGC:

    - Sets the cost to 70.
    - Sets a maximum message size limit of 10 MB.
    - Specifies new source and target servers for the connector.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Cost
  description: |+
    The Cost parameter specifies a cost to the connector. Transport servers use the connector cost to determine the least cost routing path from a source server to the destination server for message delivery.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RoutingGroupConnectorIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the name or GUID of the routing group connector. The name is expressed as [[Administrative Group Name\\]Routing Group Name]\\Routing Group Connector Name.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Unlimited" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaxMessageSize
  description: |+
    The MaxMessageSize parameter specifies the maximum size of a message that can pass through a routing group connector. The default value is unlimited. When you enter a value, qualify the value with one of the following units:

    - B (bytes)
    - KB (kilobytes)
    - MB (megabytes)
    - GB (gigabytes)

    Unqualified values are treated as bytes. The valid input range for this parameter is from 64KB through Int64. To remove the message size limit on a Send connector, enter a value of unlimited.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies the name of the routing group connector.

  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PublicFolderReferralsEnabled
  description: |+
    The PublicFolderReferralsEnabled parameter specifies whether users can use this routing group connector to access a public folder replica located in the routing group of the target servers when an instance of that public folder isn't available in the same routing group as the user's mailbox. The default value is $true.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SourceTransportServers
  description: |+
    The SourceTransportServers parameter specifies the host name or FQDN of the transport servers that are used to send messages to the target transport servers. You can specify more than one server by separating each entry with a comma. For more information about how to add or remove values from multivalued properties, see [Modifying Multivalued Properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2010/bb684908(v=exchg.141)).

  name: TargetTransportServers
  description: |+
    The TargetTransportServers parameter specifies the host name or FQDN of the transport servers that receive messages from the source transport servers. You can specify more than one server by separating each entry with a comma. For more information about how to add or remove values from multivalued properties, see [Modifying Multivalued Properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2010/bb684908(v=exchg.141)).

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Set-RoutingGroupConnector
name: Set-RoutingGroupConnector
description: |-
  The Set-RoutingGroupConnector cmdlet modifies the properties of an existing routing group connector. A routing group connector is used to send and receive messages between computers running Exchange 2010 that have the Hub Transport server role installed and Exchange 2003 bridgehead servers when the organization is running more than one version of Exchange.

  The Exchange 2003 source servers specified in this cmdlet are automatically added to the ExchangeLegacyInterop universal security group. By default, the Exchange 2010 system grants Send to and Receive from permissions on the Hub Transport servers to members of this group. The source and target servers must be computers that have the Exchange 2010 Hub Transport server role installed, or Exchange 2003 bridgehead servers.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
