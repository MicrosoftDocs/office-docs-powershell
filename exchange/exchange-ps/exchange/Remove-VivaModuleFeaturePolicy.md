This cmdlet is available only in the Exchange Online PowerShell module v3.2.0 or later. For more information, see [About the Exchange Online PowerShell module](https://aka.ms/exov3-module).

**Note**: This cmdlet is part of a feature that's currently in a closed Private Preview. The cmdlet won't work unless your organization is a member of the Private Preview.

Use the Remove-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet to delete an access policy for a feature in a Viva module. Once you delete a policy, the policy is permanently deleted. You cannot undo the deletion.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## DESCRIPTION
Use the Remove-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet to delete an access policy for a feature in a Viva module.

To learn more about administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory, see [Role template IDs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#role-template-ids).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy -ModuleId VivaInsights -FeatureId Reflection -PolicyId 3db38dfa-02a3-4039-b33a-42b0b3da029b
```

This example deletes the specified policy for the Reflection feature in Viva Insights.

## PARAMETERS

### -FeatureId
The FeatureId parameter specifies the feature in the Viva module that you want to remove the policy from.

To view details about the features in a Viva module that support feature access controls, use the Get-VivaModuleFeature cmdlet. The FeatureId value is returned in the output of the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ModuleId
The ModuleId parameter specifies the Viva module of the feature that you want to remove the policy from.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PolicyId
The PolicyId parameter specifies the policy for the feature in the Viva module that you want to remove.

To view details about the added policies for a feature in a Viva module, refer to the Get-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet. The details provided by the Get-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet include the policy identifier.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResultSize
This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
