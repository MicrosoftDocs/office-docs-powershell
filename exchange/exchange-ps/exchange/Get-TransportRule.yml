parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DlpPolicy
  description: |+
    **Note**: This parameter is functional only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DlpPolicy parameter filters the results by the name of the specified data loss prevention (DLP) policy. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

    DLP policies in your organization allow you to prevent unintentional disclosure of sensitive information. Each DLP policy is enforced using a set of transport rules.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

  name: ExcludeConditionActionDetails

    The ExcludeConditionActionDetails parameter specifies whether to hide specific details from the results. Valid values are:

    - $false: No properties or property values are hidden. This is the default value.

  name: Filter
  description: |+
    The Filter parameter filters the results by using an OPATH. This parameter searches the Description property, which includes the conditions, exceptions, actions and the associated values of a transport rule.

    This parameter uses the syntax `"Description -like 'Text*'"`. For example, `"Description -like '192.168.1.1*'"`.
