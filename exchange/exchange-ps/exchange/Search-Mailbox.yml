### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Search-Mailbox cmdlet to search a mailbox and copy the results to a specified target mailbox, delete messages from the source mailbox, or both.

  **Note**: In cloud-based environments, the Search-Mailbox cmdlet is being deprecated in favor of [New-ComplianceSearch](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/new-compliancesearch) and related eDiscovery cmdlets.

  By default, Search-Mailbox is available only in the Mailbox Search or Mailbox Import Export roles, and these roles aren't assigned to *any* role groups. To use this cmdlet, you need to add one or both of the roles to a role group (for example, the Organization Management role group). Only the Mailbox Import Export role gives you access to the DeleteContent parameter. For more information about adding roles to role groups, see [Add a role to a role group](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions/role-groups#add-a-role-to-a-role-group).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf

  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DeleteContent
  description: |+
    **Note**: You need to be assigned the Mailbox Import Export management role to use this switch. By default, this role isn't assigned to any role group (including Organization Management). Typically, you assign a role to a built-in or custom role group.

    The DeleteContent switch specifies that the messages returned by the search be permanently deleted from the source mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    When you use this switch with the TargetMailbox parameter, messages are copied to the target mailbox and removed from the source mailbox. If you set the logging level for the search to Basic or Full, you must specify a target mailbox and a target folder to place the log in. To delete messages from the source mailbox without copying them to the target mailbox, don't specify the TargetMailbox, TargetFolder, and LogLevel parameters.

    Before you use the DeleteContent switch to delete content, we recommend that you test search parameters by using the LogOnly parameter, as shown in Example 2.

  name: DoNotIncludeArchive
  description: |+
    The DoNotIncludeArchive switch specifies that the user's archive mailbox shouldn't be included in the search. You don't need to specify a value for this switch.

    By default, the archive mailbox is always searched.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="LoggingLevel" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogLevel
  description: |+
    The LogLevel parameter specifies the logging level for the search. It can have one of the following values:

    - Suppress: No logs are kept.
    - Basic: Basic information about the query and who ran it is kept.
    - Full: In addition to the information kept by the Basic log level, the Full log level adds a complete list of search results.

    The default log level is Basic.

    When you included this parameter, an email message is created and sent to the mailbox specified by the TargetMailbox parameter. The log file (which is a CSV-formatted file named Search Results.csv) is attached to this email message, and will be located in the folder specified by the TargetFolder parameter. The log file contains a row for each message that's included in the search results when you run the Search-Mailbox cmdlet.

  description: |+
    The SearchDumpster switch specifies whether to include the Recoverable Items folder in the search. The Recoverable items folder stores items that were deleted from the Deleted Items folder or items that were hard-deleted until they're purged from the mailbox database.

    By default, the Recoverable Items folder is always included in the search. To exclude the Recoverable Items folder from the search, use this exact syntax: `-SearchDumpster:$false`.

  defaultValue: None
