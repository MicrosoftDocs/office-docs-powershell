parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the server on which to perform the health test. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - ExchangeLegacyDN
    - GUID

    If you don't specify the server, the command runs on the local server.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaxQueueScanAgeSeconds
  description: |+
    The MaxQueueScanAgeSeconds parameter specifies the threshold for the last queue scan property. If the time stamp on the last queue scan property is older than the value specified by this parameter, an error event is created that shows the Mailbox Replication service isn't scanning mailbox database queues. The default value is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MonitoringContext
  description: |+
    The MonitoringContext parameter specifies whether to include the associated monitoring events and performance counters in the results. Valid values are:

    - $true: Monitoring events and performance counters are included in the command results. Typically, you include the monitoring events and performance counters in the results when the output is passed to Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM).
    - $false: Monitoring events and performance counters aren't included in the command results. This is the default value.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MRSProxyCredentials
  description: |+
    The MRSProxyCredentials parameter specifies the credentials that are required for the MRSProxyPingCheck test on the server that's specified by the MRSProxyServer parameter.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MRSProxyServer
  description: |+
    The MRSProxyServer parameter specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the target server for the MRSProxyPingCheck test.

    The Microsoft Replication proxy service is part of the Mailbox Replication service, and is used for remote mailbox moves. However, the Mailbox Replication proxy service communicates only with the Mailbox Replication service on another server. You can test the Mailbox Replication proxy service in the following ways:

    - If you specify an MRSProxyServer value and you specify the source server by using the Identity parameter, the test is performed between that server and the target server specified by the MRSProxyServer parameter.
    - If you specify an MRSProxyServer value and you don't specify a source server by using the Identity parameter, the test is performed between the local server and the target server specified by the MRSProxyServer parameter.
    - If you don't specify an MRSProxyServer value or an Identity value, the test is performed between the Mailbox Replication service and the Mailbox Replication proxy service on the local server.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
