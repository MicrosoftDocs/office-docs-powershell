examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    Move-DatabasePath -Identity MyDatabase01 -EdbFilePath C:\NewFolder\MyDatabase01.edb
  description: |-
    This example sets a new path for the mailbox database specified by the mailbox database name. To perform the move operation, the database must be temporarily dismounted, making it inaccessible to all users. If the database is currently dismounted, it isn't remounted upon completion.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ConfigurationOnly
  description: |+
    The ConfigurationOnly switch specifies whether to change the configuration of the database without moving any files. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you don't use this switch, the configuration of the database changes and the files are moved.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    This cmdlet has a built-in pause, so use `-Confirm:$false` to skip the confirmation.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Server 2010

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="EdbFilePath" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EDBFilePath
  description: |+
    The EdbFilePath parameter specifies a new file path for the database. All current database files are moved to this location. The default location is `%ExchangeInstallPath%Mailbox\LocalCopies\MBDatabase.edb`. This file path can't be the same as the path for the backup copy of the database.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the database that you want to move. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010

  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="NonRootLocalLongFullPath" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogFolderPath
  description: |+
    The LogFolderPath parameter specifies the folder where log files are stored.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Move-DatabasePath
name: Move-DatabasePath
description: |-
  When you use the Move-DatabasePath cmdlet, consider the following:

  - This cmdlet fails if it's run while the database is being backed up.
  - If the specified database is mounted when this cmdlet is run, the database is automatically dismounted and then remounted, and is unavailable to users while it's dismounted.
  - In Exchange 2013 or earlier, you can only run this cmdlet on the affected Mailbox server. If you include the ConfigurationOnly parameter with the value $true, you can run the cmdlet on an administrator's workstation. This does not apply to Exchange 2016 or later (you can run the cmdlet anywhere).
  - This cmdlet can't be run against replicated mailbox databases. To move the path of a replicated database, you must first remove all replicated copies, and then you can perform the move operation. After the move operation is complete, you can add copies of the mailbox database.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
