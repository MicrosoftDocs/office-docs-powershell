### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the New-UMIPGateway cmdlet to create a Unified Messaging (UM) IP gateway. A UM IP gateway is used to connect Unified Messaging servers to an IP gateway or a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-enabled IP Private Branch eXchange (PBX).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="UMSmartHost" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Address
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Address parameter specifies the IP address configured on the IP gateway or SIP-enabled IP PBX.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="IPAddressFamily" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IPAddressFamily
  description: |+
    The IPAddressFamily parameter specifies whether the UM IP gateway will use Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), IPv6, or both to communicate. Valid values are:

    - IPv4Only: The UM IP gateway will only use IPv4 to communicate. This is the default value.
    - IPv6Only: The UM IP gateway will only use IPv6.
    - Any: IPv6 will be used first, and then if necessary, it will fall back to IPv4.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies the display name for the UM IP gateway. The name for the new UM IP gateway can contain up to 64 characters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UMDialPlanIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UMDialPlan
  description: |+
    The UMDialPlan parameter specifies the UM dial plan to be associated with the UM IP gateway.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: wi

  - Exchange Server 2010

  A UM IP gateway has organization-wide scope and references a single physical IP gateway. The UM IP gateway that's created is used to establish a connection to an IP gateway or a SIP-enabled IP PBX. After this task is completed, a new UM IP gateway is created.

  This cmdlet is scheduled to be removed from Exchange Online on December 1, 2019. For more information, see this [blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Exchange-Team-Blog/New-date-for-discontinuation-of-support-for-Session-Border/ba-p/607853).
