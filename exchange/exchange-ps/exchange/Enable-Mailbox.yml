### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Enable-Mailbox cmdlet to create mailboxes for existing users who don't already have mailboxes. You can also use this cmdlet to create In-Place archives for existing mailboxes.

  **Note**: In Exchange Online, you use this cmdlet to add archive mailboxes for existing users and to enable auto-expanding archives. To add a mailbox for an existing Microsoft Entra account, you need to add a license to the account as described in [Assign licenses to user accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/powershell/assign-licenses-to-user-accounts-with-office-365-powershell).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="MailboxPolicyIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy parameter specifies the mobile device mailbox policy that's applied to the mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:.

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    If you don't use this parameter, the default mobile device mailbox policy is applied to the mailbox.

  defaultValue: None

  name: AddressBookPolicy
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The AddressBookPolicy parameter specifies the address book policy that's applied to the mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the address book policy. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    For more information about address book policies, see [Address book policies in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/email-addresses-and-address-books/address-book-policies/address-book-policies).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Alias
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The Alias parameter specifies the Exchange alias (also known as the mail nickname) for the recipient. This value identifies the recipient as a mail-enabled object, and shouldn't be confused with multiple email addresses for the same recipient (also known as proxy addresses). A recipient can have only one Alias value. The maximum length is 64 characters.

    The Alias value can contain letters, numbers and the following characters:

    - !, #, %, \*, +, -, /, =, ?, ^, \_, and ~.
    - $, &, ', \`, {, }, and \| need to be escaped (for example ``-Alias what`'snew``) or the entire value enclosed in single quotation marks (for example, `-Alias 'what'snew'`). The & character is not supported in the Alias value for Microsoft Entra Connect synchronization.
    - Periods (.) must be surrounded by other valid characters (for example, `help.desk`).
    - Unicode characters U+00A1 to U+00FF.

    When you create a recipient without specifying an email address, the Alias value you specify is used to generate the primary email address (`alias@domain`). Supported Unicode characters are mapped to best-fit US-ASCII text characters. For example, U+00F6 (ö) is changed to `oe` in the primary email address.

    If you don't use the Alias parameter when you create a recipient, the value of a different required parameter is used for the Alias property value:

    - Recipients with user accounts (for example, user mailboxes, and mail users): The left side of the MicrosoftOnlineServicesID or UserPrincipalName parameter is used. For example, helpdesk@contoso.onmicrosoft.com results in the Alias property value `helpdesk`.
    - Recipients without user accounts (for example, room mailboxes, mail contacts, and distribution groups): The value of the Name parameter is used. Spaces are removed and unsupported characters are converted to question marks (?).

    If you modify the Alias value of an existing recipient, the primary email address is automatically updated only in environments where the recipient is subject to email address policies (the EmailAddressPolicyEnabled property is True for the recipient).

    The Alias parameter never generates or updates the primary email address of a mail contact or a mail user.

  name: ArchiveDomain
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The ArchiveDomain parameter specifies the domain in the cloud-based service where the archive that's associated with this mailbox exists. For example, if the SMTP email address of the user is tony@contoso.com, the SMTP domain could be archive.contoso.com.

    Only use this parameter if the archive is hosted in the cloud-based service.

  name: ArchiveName
  description: |+
    The ArchiveName parameter specifies the name of the archive mailbox. This is the name displayed to users in Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App). If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

    In on-premises Exchange, if you don't use this parameter, the following default values are used based on the version of Exchange:

    - Exchange 2016 or later: `In-Place Archive -<Display Name>`
    - Exchange 2013: `In-Place Archive - <Display Name>`
    - Exchange 2010: `Personal Archive - <Display Name>`

    In Exchange Online, if you don't use this parameter, the default value is `In-Place Archive -<Display Name>`.

    In Outlook in Exchange Online, the value of this parameter is ignored. The name of the archive mailbox that's shown in the folder list is `Online Archive - <PrimarySMTPAddress>`.

  name: AutoExpandingArchive
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The AutoExpandingArchive switch enables the auto-expanding archiving feature for the specified mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    After you enable auto-expanding archiving, additional storage space is automatically added to the user's archive mailbox when it approaches the storage limit.

    **Notes**:

    - The user's archive mailbox has to be enabled before auto-expanding archiving can be enabled.
    - After you enable auto-expanding archiving for the user's mailbox, it can't be disabled.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The LinkedCredential parameter specifies the credentials used to access the domain controller that's specified by the LinkedDomainController parameter. This parameter is optional, even if you're enabling a linked mailbox.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter.

description: |-
  The Enable-Mailbox cmdlet mailbox-enables existing users, public folders, or InetOrgPerson objects by adding the mailbox attributes that are required by Exchange. When the user logs on to the mailbox or receives email messages, the mailbox object is actually created in the Exchange database.

  When mailbox-enabling an existing user, beware of non-supported characters in the user account or Name property. If you don't specify an Alias value when you mailbox-enable the user, Exchange converts all non-supported characters to question marks (?). To avoid question marks in the Alias, verify that the user account and Name properties have only supported ASCII or Unicode characters or specify an Alias value when you mailbox-enable the user.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

  In Exchange Server, the [CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=113216) InformationVariable and InformationAction don't work.
