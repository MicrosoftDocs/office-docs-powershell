  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="RmsTemplateIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ApplyRightsProtectionTemplate
  description: |+
    The ApplyRightsProtectionTemplate parameter specifies an RMS template to be applied to messages matching the conditions.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf

  - Exchange Server 2010

    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    Use this switch to suppress the confirmation prompt that appears when you modify a rule with no conditions (the rule applies to all messages).

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Set-OutlookProtectionRule
name: Set-OutlookProtectionRule
description: |-
  Outlook protection rules are used to automatically rights-protect email messages using a Rights Management Services (RMS) template before the message is sent. However, Outlook protection rules don't inspect message content. To rights-protect messages based on message content, use transport protection rules. For more information, see [Outlook protection rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/outlook-protection-rules-exchange-2013-help).

  Not specifying any conditions results in an Outlook protection rule being applied to all messages.
