description: |-
  For each on-premise mailbox that's configured for journal archiving in Microsoft 365, a mail user (also known as a mail-enabled user) and a journal archive mailbox are created in Exchange Online. The mail user routes the incoming journaled messages from the on-premises organization, and the journal archive mailbox stores the journaled messages in the cloud.

  The Disable-JournalArchiving cmdlet removes the mail user and converts the journal archive mailbox into an inactive mailbox. The inactive mailbox remains fully available for In-place eDiscovery.

  In hybrid organizations that use DirSync, this cmdlet doesn't remove the mail user. Removal of the mail user is handled by DirSync.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
