parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BypassFiltering
  description: |+
    The BypassFiltering parameter temporarily bypasses malware filtering without disabling the Malware agent on the server. The Malware agent is still active, and the agent is still called for every message, but no malware filtering is actually performed. This allows you to temporarily disable and then enable malware filtering on the server without disrupting mail flow by restarting the Microsoft Exchange Transport service. Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false. The default value is $false.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DeferAttempts
  description: |+
    The DeferAttempts parameter specifies the maximum number of times to defer a message that can't be scanned by the Malware agent. Valid input for this parameter is an integer between 1 and 5. The default value is 3.

    After the maximum number of deferrals is reached, the action taken by the Malware agent depends on the error. For scan timeouts and engine errors, the action is to fail the message and return a non-delivery report (NDR) to the sender immediately after the last defer attempt. For all other errors, the message is retried for up to 48 hours, with each retry attempt taking place one hour longer than the last one. For example, starting after the last defer attempt, the first retry attempt will occur in 1 hour, the next retry attempt will occur 2 hours after that, the next retry attempt will occur 3 hours after the second retry attempt, and so on for up to 48 hours. After 48 hours have elapsed, the action is to fail the message and return a non-delivery report (NDR) to the sender.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DeferWaitTime
  description: |+
    The DeferWaitTime parameter specifies the time period in minutes to increase the interval to resubmit messages for malware filtering in an effort to reduce the workload on the server.

    For example, the first retry after the original failed scan occurs after the interval specified by the DeferWaitTime parameter. The second retry after the first retry occurs after two times the value of the DeferWaitTime parameter. The third retry after the second retry occurs after three times the value of the DeferWaitTime parameter and so on. The maximum number of retries is controlled by the DeferAttempts parameter.

    Valid input for this parameter is an integer between 0 and 15. The default value is 5. This means the first resubmit occurs 5 minutes after the original failed scan, the second retry occurs 10 minutes after the first retry, the third retry occurs 15 minutes after the second retry and so on. The value 0 means messages are resubmitted for malware filtering after any failed scanning attempts without any delay.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

  name: ForceRescan
  description: |+
    The ForceRescan parameter specifies that messages should be scanned by the malware agent, even if the message was already scanned by Exchange Online Protection. Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false. The default value is $false.

  name: Identity

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Exchange Legacy DN
