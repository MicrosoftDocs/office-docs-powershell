  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    The Enabled parameter specifies whether the new format is enabled at creation.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Extension
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Extension parameter specifies the file type to be processed by the filter and is designated by the common file extension associated with the file type. Examples include .MP3, .JPG and .PNG. Note the leading period.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SearchDocumentFormatId" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter uniquely identifies the new search document format. For example, an identity of "PropSCT" might specify a proprietary document format which is supported by a custom IFilter. The Identity parameter must be unique within the search document formats.

  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Name specifies a friendly name for the format, but does not need to be unique. For example, you might have several different formats (supported by custom IFilters) that are used to index output from a proprietary system called "My Business Output". You could use the Name parameter to create a category of formats called "My Business Output Formats" and uniquely identify each format within that group using the Identity parameter.

- type: <xref href="ServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    The Server parameter specifies the Exchange server where you want to run this command. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Exchange Legacy DN

    If you don't use this parameter, the command is run on the local server.
