  This cmdlet is functional only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Import-DlpPolicyCollection cmdlet to import data loss prevention (DLP) policy collections that are based on transport rules (mail flow rules) into your organization.

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

- type: <xref href="Byte" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: FileData
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The FileData parameter specifies the DLP policy collection file you want to import.

    A valid value for this parameter requires you to read the file to a byte-encoded object using the following syntax: `([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('<Path>\<FileName>'))`. You can use this command as the parameter value, or you can write the output to a variable (`$data = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('<Path>\<FileName>')`) and use the variable as the parameter value (`$data`).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

- type: <xref href="DlpPolicyIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the name of the DLP policy you want to import. The DLP policy must exist in the XML file you specify with the FileData parameter.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

name: Import-DlpPolicyCollection
description: |-
  The Import-DlpPolicyCollection cmdlet imports all the settings of the DLP policies and the associated transport rules. You use the Export-DlpPolicyCollection cmdlet to export the DLP policy collection.

  Importing a DLP policy collection from an XML file removes or overwrites all pre-existing DLP policies that were defined in your organization. Make sure that you have a backup of your current DLP policy collection before you import and overwrite your current DLP policies.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
