parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comments
  description: |+
    The Comments parameter specifies informative comments for the rule, such as what the rule is used for or how it has changed over time. The length of the comment can't exceed 1024 characters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the rule. The maximum length is 64 characters.

    The default value for the rule that's associated with the Strict preset security policy is 0, and the default value for the rule that's associated with the Standard preset security policy is 1.

    You must use the default value for the rule.
