parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Archive
  description: |+
    The Archive switch specifies that the test is run against the archive mailbox for the mailbox user specified by the Identity parameter. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016

    The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox that you want to test Exchange Search against. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN

  name: IndexingTimeoutInSeconds
  description: |+
    The IndexingTimeoutInSeconds parameter specifies, in seconds, the maximum amount of time to wait between adding the new email message to the test mailbox and waiting for it to be returned in a search result. The default value is 120 seconds. If this parameter isn't specified, the default interval is used.

    The MailboxDatabase parameter specifies the mailbox database to test Exchange Search against. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity or Server parameters.

  defaultValue: None

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Test-ExchangeSearch
name: Test-ExchangeSearch
description: |-
  The Test-ExchangeSearch cmdlet creates a hidden message and an attachment in the specified mailbox that's visible only to Exchange Search. The command waits for the message to be indexed and then searches for the content. It reports success or failure depending on whether the message is found after the interval set in the IndexingTimeoutInSeconds parameter has elapsed.

  You can use the Verbose switch to get detailed information about each step performed by the cmdlet as part of the test.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
