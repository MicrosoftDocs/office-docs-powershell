description: |-
  A retention policy is associated with a group of retention policy tags that specify retention settings for items in a mailbox. A policy may contain one default policy tag to move items to an archive mailbox, one default policy tag to delete all items, one default policy tag to delete voicemail items and multiple personal tags to move or delete items. A mailbox can have only one retention policy applied to it. The Get-RetentionPolicy cmdlet displays all policy settings associated with the specified policy.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet.
