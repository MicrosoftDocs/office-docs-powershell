# Search-UnifiedAuditLog

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet to search the unified audit log. This log contains events from Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Teams, Power BI, Sway, and other Office 365 services. You can search for all events in a specified date range, or you can filter the results based on specific criteria, such as the user who performed the action, the action, or the target object.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## DESCRIPTION
The Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet presents pages of data based on repeated iterations of the same command. Use SessionId and SessionCommand to repeatedly run the cmdlet until you get zero returns, or hit the maximum number of results based on the session command. To gauge progress, look at the ResultIndex (hits in the current iteration) and ResultCount (hits for all iterations) properties of the data returned by the cmdlet.

The Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet is available in Exchange Online PowerShell. You can also view events from the unified auditing log by using the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center. For more information, see Search the audit log in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=708432).

If you want to programmatically download data from the Office 365 audit log, we recommend that you use the Office 365 Management Activity API instead of using the Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet in a PowerShell script. The Office 365 Management Activity API is a REST web service that you can use to develop operations, security, and compliance monitoring solutions for your organization. For more information, see Office 365 Management Activity API reference (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=852309).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 5/1/2018 -EndDate 5/2/2018
```

This example searches the unified audit log for all events from May 1, 201812:00AM to May 2, 2018 12:00AM.

Note: If you don't include a timestamp in the value for the StartDate or EndDate parameters, the default timestamp 12:00 AM (midnight) is used.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate "6/1/2018 8:00 AM" -EndDate "6/1/2018 6:00 PM" -RecordType ExchangeAdmin
```

This example searches the unified audit log for all Exchange admin events from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM on June 1, 2018.

>[!NOTE]
> If you use the same date for the StartDate and EndDate parameters, you have to include a timestamp; otherwise, no results will be returned because the date and time for the start and end dates will be the same.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 5/1/2018 -EndDate 5/8/2018 -SessionId "UnifiedAuditLogSearch 05/08/17" -SessionCommand ReturnNextPreviewPage
```

This example searches the unified audit log for all events from May 1, 2018 to May 8, 2018. If you don't include a time stamp in the StartDate or EndDate parameters, The data is returned in pages as the command is rerun sequentially while using the same SessionId value.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the SessionCommand value ReturnLargeSet, and then you use the value ReturnNextPreviewPage for the same session ID, the results are limited to 10,000 records (not 50,000).

### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 5/1/2018 -EndDate 5/8/2018 -RecordType SharePointFileOperation -Operations FileAccessed -SessionId "WordDocs_SharepointViews"-SessionCommand ReturnNextPreviewPage
```

This example searches the unified audit log for any files accessed in SharePoint Online from May 1, 2018 to May 8, 2018. The data is returned in pages as the command is rerun sequentially while using the same SessionId value.

### -------------------------- Example 5 --------------------------
```
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 5/1/2018 -EndDate 5/8/2018 -ObjectIDs "https://alpinehouse.sharepoint.com/sites/contoso/Departments/SM/International/Shared Documents/Sales Invoice - International.docx"

## PARAMETERS

### -EndDate
The EndDate parameter specifies the end date of the date range.

Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

If you don't include a timestamp in the value for this parameter, the default timestamp is 12:00 AM (midnight) on the specified date.

```yaml
Type: ExDateTime
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StartDate
The StartDate parameter specifies the start date of the date range.

Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018.

```

### -Formatted
The Formatted switch causes attributes that are normally returned as integers (for example, RecordType and Operation) to be formatted as descriptive strings. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. 
In addition it will make AuditData more readable.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ObjectIds
The ObjectIds parameter filters the log entries by object ID. The object ID is the target object that was acted upon, and depends on the RecordType and Operations values of the event.
