# Set-SystemMessage

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Set-SystemMessage cmdlet to modify custom system messages. System messages are delivery status notifications (also known as DSNs, non-delivery reports, NDRs or bounce messages) and quota messages.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-SystemMessage [-Identity] <SystemMessageIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-Name <String>]
 [-Original] [-Text <String>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-SystemMessage En\Internal\5.3.5 -Text "The recipient email system can't process this email message. Please contact your system administrator for more information."
```

This example modifies the text of the custom English system message for the enhanced status code 5.3.5 for internal senders.

### Example 2
```powershell
Set-SystemMessage En\WarningMailbox -Text "Your mailbox has exceeded the warning limit specified by your email administrator. Please reduce the size of your mailbox."
```

This example modifies the text of the custom English WarningMailbox quota message.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the custom system message that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the system message. For example:

- Identity

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

The identity value of a system message uses one of these formats:

- System messages for enhanced status codes: \<Language\>\\\<Internal \| External\>\\\<DSNcode\>. For example, En\\Internal\\5.1.2 or Ja\\External\\5.1.2.

- System messages for quotas: \<Language\>\\\<QuotaMessageType\>. For example, En\\ProhibitSendReceiveMailBox.

\<Language\>: For the list of supported language codes, see [Supported languages for NDRs](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow/non-delivery-reports-and-bounce-messages/ndr-procedures#supported-languages-for-ndrs).

\<DSNcode\>: Valid values are 4.x.y or 5.x.y where x and y are one to three digit numbers. To see the enhanced system codes that are currently used by custom system messages, run the command Get-SystemMessage. To generate a list of default enhanced status codes that are used by Exchange, run this command: Get-SystemMessage -Original | Select-Object -Property Identity,DsnCode,Language,Text | ConvertTo-Html | Set-Content -Path "C:\\My Documents\\Default DSNs.html".

\<QuotaMessageType\>: Valid value are:

Mailbox size quotas:

Maximum number of messages in a mailbox folder:

- ProhibitReceiveMailboxMessagesPerFolderCount: A mailbox exceeds its MailboxMessagesPerFolderCountReceiveQuota limit.

- WarningMailboxMessagesPerFolderCount: A mailbox exceeds its MailboxMessagesPerFolderCountWarningQuota limit when it has a MailboxMessagesPerFolderCountReceiveQuota limit configured.

- WarningMailboxMessagesPerFolderUnlimitedCount: A mailbox exceeds its MailboxMessagesPerFolderCountWarningQuota limit when it doesn't have a MailboxMessagesPerFolderCountReceiveQuota limit configured.

Maximum number of subfolders in a mailbox folder:

- ProhibitReceiveFolderHierarchyChildrenCountCount: A mailbox exceeds its FolderHierarchyChildrenCountReceiveQuota limit.

- WarningFolderHierarchyChildrenCount: A mailbox exceeds its FolderHierarchyChildrenCountWarningQuota limit when it has a FolderHierarchyChildrenCountReceiveQuota limit configured.

- WarningFoldersCountUnlimited A mailbox exceeds its FoldersCountWarningQuota limit when it doesn't have a FoldersCountReceiveQuota limit configured.

Maximum number of levels (depth) in a mailbox folder:

- ProhibitReceiveFolderHierarchyDepth: A mailbox exceeds its FolderHierarchyDepthWarningQuota limit.

- WarningFolderHierarchyDepthUnlimited: : A mailbox exceeds its FolderHierarchyDepthWarningQuota limit when it doesn't have a FolderHierarchyDepthReceiveQuota limit configured.

```yaml
Type: SystemMessageIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
The Name parameter specifies a descriptive name for the system message. The maximum length is 64 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Original
The Original switch specifies whether to stop using the custom system message and start using the default system message. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

This switch is useful when you want to preserve the custom system message without using it.

This switch only works on custom system messages for default (not new) enhanced status code values.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Text
The Text parameter specifies the text in the custom system message. The text should explain why the system message was sent and any actions that the user should take.

This parameter can contain text and HTML tags. The maximum length is 512 characters (which includes all text and HTML tags).

The following HTML tags are available:

- \<B\> and \</B\> (bold)

- \<EM\> and \</EM\> (italic)

- \<BR\> (line break)

- \<P\> and \</P\> (paragraph)

- \<A HREF="url"\> and \</A\> (hyperlink)

You need to use single quotation marks (not double quotation marks) around the complete text string if you use the hyperlink tag. Otherwise, you'll receive an error (because of the double quotation marks in the tag).

Use the following escape codes for these special characters:

- &lt; for \<.

- &gt; for \>.

- &quot; for ".

- &amp; for &.

Here's an example value for this parameter that uses HTML tags and special characters:

'You tried to send a message to a \<B\>disabled\</B\> mailbox. Please visit \<A HREF="https://it.contoso.com"\>Internal Support\</A\> or contact &quot;InfoSec&quot; for more information.'

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
