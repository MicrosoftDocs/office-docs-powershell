# Remove-OnPremisesOrganization

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Remove-OnPremisesOrganization cmdlet to remove an OnPremisesOrganization object in a Microsoft Office 365 tenant.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-OnPremisesOrganization [-Identity] <OnPremisesOrganizationIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Removing an OnPremisesOrganization object should only be used in circumstances where the hybrid deployment state is corrupt and under the direction and supervision of Microsoft Customer Service and Support. After removing the OnPremisesOrganization object, any related hybrid deployment configured with this object won't be functional and will need to be re-created and reconfigured.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Remove-OnPremisesOrganization -Identity ExchangeMail
```

This example removes the ExchangeMail OnPremisesOrganization object in an Office 365 tenant.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the identity of the on-premises organization object. You can use the following values:

- Canonical name

- GUID

- Name

```yaml
Type: OnPremisesOrganizationIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
