  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AccountOnly
  description: |+
    The AccountOnly switch specifies whether to perform an account-only remote device wipe where only Exchange mailbox data is removed from the device. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You don't need to use this switch for the DeviceType value Outlook, because an account-only remote device wipe is the only type of wipe that's used on Outlook devices.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Cancel
  description: |+
    The Cancel switch specifies whether to issue a cancellation request for a pending remote device wipe. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    This cmdlet has a built-in pause, so use `-Confirm:$false` to skip the confirmation.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MobileDeviceIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the mobile device that you want to reset. You can use the following values that uniquely identifies the mobile device:

    - Identity (`<Mailbox Name>\ExchangeActiveSyncDevices\<MobileDeviceObjectName>` for example, `CarlosM\ExchangeActiveSyncDevices\REST§Outlook§5eec4e941e0748a264512fd83770d5ac`)
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID (same as ExchangeObjectId)

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NotificationEmailAddresses

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Clear-MobileDevice
name: Clear-MobileDevice
description: |-
  The Clear-MobileDevice cmdlet deletes all user data from a mobile device the next time that the device receives data from the Microsoft Exchange server. This cmdlet sets the DeviceWipeStatus parameter to $true. The mobile device acknowledges the cmdlet and records the time stamp in the DeviceWipeAckTime parameter.

  After you run this cmdlet, you receive a warning that states: "This command will force all the data on the device to be permanently deleted. Do you want to continue?" You must respond to the warning for the cmdlet to run on the mobile phone.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
