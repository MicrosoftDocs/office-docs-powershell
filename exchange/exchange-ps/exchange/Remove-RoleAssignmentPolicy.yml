parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Remove-RoleAssignmentPolicy
name: Remove-RoleAssignmentPolicy
description: |-
  The assignment policy you want to remove can't be assigned to any mailboxes or management roles. Also, if you want to remove the default assignment policy, it must be the last assignment policy. Do the following before you attempt to remove an assignment policy:

  - Use the Set-Mailbox cmdlet to change the assignment policy for any mailbox assigned the assignment policy you want to remove.
  - If the assignment policy is the default assignment policy, use the Set-RoleAssignmentPolicy cmdlet to select a new default assignment policy. You don't need to do this if you're removing the last assignment policy.
  - Use the Remove-ManagementRoleAssignment cmdlet to remove any management role assignments assigned to the policy.

  For more information about assignment policies, see [Understanding management role assignment policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/understanding-management-role-assignment-policies-exchange-2013-help).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
