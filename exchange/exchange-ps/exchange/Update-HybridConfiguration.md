# Update-HybridConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Update-HybridConfiguration cmdlet to define the credentials that are used to update the hybrid configuration object.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Update-HybridConfiguration -OnPremisesCredentials <PSCredential> -TenantCredentials <PSCredential> [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-WhatIf] [-ForceUpgrade] [-SuppressOAuthWarning] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
$OnPremisesCreds = Get-Credential; $TenantCreds = Get-Credential; Update-HybridConfiguration -OnPremisesCredentials $OnPremisesCreds -TenantCredentials $TenantCreds
```

This example defines the credentials that are used to update the hybrid configuration object and connect to the Microsoft 365 for enterprises organization.

Use the first command to specify your on-premises organization credentials. For example, run this command and enter \<domain\>\\admin@contoso.com and the associated password in the resulting Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box.

Use the second command to specify your Microsoft 365 organization credentials. For example, run this command and then enter admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com and the associated account password in the resulting Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box.

Use the last command to define the credentials that are used to update the hybrid configuration object and connect to the Microsoft 365 organization.

## PARAMETERS

### -OnPremisesCredentials
The OnPremisesCredentials parameter specifies the on-premises Active Directory account and password that's used to configure the hybrid configuration object. This account must be a member of the Organization Management role group.

A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TenantCredentials
The TenantCredentials parameter specifies the Microsoft 365 organization account and password that's used to configure the hybrid configuration object. This is often the administrator account that's assigned when the Microsoft 365 organization was created. This account must be a member of the Global admin role.

A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ForceUpgrade
The ForceUpgrade switch specifies whether to suppress the confirmation message that appears if the object was created in a previous version of Exchange. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

This confirmation prompt is only displayed when the existing HybridConfiguration Active Directory object version is Exchange 2010.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SuppressOAuthWarning
This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
