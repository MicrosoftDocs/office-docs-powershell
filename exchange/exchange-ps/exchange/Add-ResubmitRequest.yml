    This example replays the redundant copies of messages delivered from 6:00 PM June 1, 2018 to 5:00 AM June 2 2018 to the recovered mailbox database 5364aeea-6e6b-4055-8258-229b2c6ac9a2.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: Destination
  description: |+
    The Destination parameter specifies the GUID of the destination mailbox database. To find the GUID of the mailbox database, run the command: `Get-MailboxDatabase -Server <ServerName> | Format-List Name,GUID`.

    You can't use this parameter with the Recipient, ResubmitTo, or Sender parameters.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EndTime
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The EndTime parameter specifies the delivery time of the latest messages that need to be resubmitted from Safety Net.

    Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

    The date and time specified by the EndTime parameter must be later than the date and time specified by the StartTime parameter. The date and time specified by both parameters must be in the past.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MessageId
  description: |+
    The MessageId parameter filters the results by the Message-ID header field of the message. This value is also known as the Client ID. The format of the Message-ID depends on the messaging server that sent the message. The value should be unique for each message. However, not all messaging servers create values for the Message-ID in the same way. Be sure to include the full Message ID string (which may include angle brackets) and enclose the value in quotation marks (for example, "<d9683b4c-127b-413a-ae2e-fa7dfb32c69d@contoso.com>").

  name: Server
  description: |+
    The Server parameter specifies the Exchange server where you want to run this command. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Exchange Legacy DN

    If you don't use this parameter, the command is run on the local server.

  name: StartTime
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The StartTime parameter specifies the delivery time of the oldest messages that need to be resubmitted from Safety Net.

    Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

  name: UnresponsivePrimaryServers
  description: |+
    The UnresponsivePrimaryServers parameter identifies the primary servers that should resubmit the messages from Safety Net as being unavailable so other servers can resubmit the messages. If the primary servers are unavailable, you can designate other servers that hold redundant copies of the messages in Safety Net to resubmit their copies of the messages. However, you must identify the unresponsive primary servers to the other servers using this parameter.
