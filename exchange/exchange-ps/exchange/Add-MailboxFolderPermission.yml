parameters:
- type: <xref href="MailboxFolderAccessRight" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: AccessRights
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The AccessRights parameter specifies the permissions that you want to add for the user on the mailbox folder.

    You can specify individual folder permissions or roles, which are combinations of permissions. You can specify multiple permissions and roles separated by commas.

    The following individual permissions are available:

    - None: The user has no access to view or interact with the folder or its contents.
    - CreateItems: The user can create items within the specified folder.
    - CreateSubfolders: The user can create subfolders in the specified folder.
    - DeleteAllItems: The user can delete all items in the specified folder.
    - DeleteOwnedItems: The user can only delete items that they created from the specified folder.
    - EditAllItems: The user can edit all items in the specified folder.
    - EditOwnedItems: The user can only edit items that they created in the specified folder.
    - FolderContact: The user is the contact for the specified public folder.
    - FolderOwner: The user is the owner of the specified folder. The user can view the folder, move the folder and create subfolders. The user can't read items, edit items, delete items or create items.
    - FolderVisible: The user can view the specified folder, but can't read or edit items within the specified public folder.
    - ReadItems: The user can read items within the specified folder.

    The roles that are available, along with the permissions that they assign, are described in the following list:

    - Author: CreateItems, DeleteOwnedItems, EditOwnedItems, FolderVisible, ReadItems
    - Contributor: CreateItems, FolderVisible
    - Editor: CreateItems, DeleteAllItems, DeleteOwnedItems, EditAllItems, EditOwnedItems, FolderVisible, ReadItems
    - NonEditingAuthor: CreateItems, DeleteOwnedItems, FolderVisible, ReadItems
    - Owner: CreateItems, CreateSubfolders, DeleteAllItems, DeleteOwnedItems, EditAllItems, EditOwnedItems, FolderContact, FolderOwner, FolderVisible, ReadItems
    - PublishingAuthor: CreateItems, CreateSubfolders, DeleteOwnedItems, EditOwnedItems, FolderVisible, ReadItems
    - PublishingEditor: CreateItems, CreateSubfolders, DeleteAllItems, DeleteOwnedItems, EditAllItems, EditOwnedItems, FolderVisible, ReadItems
    - Reviewer: FolderVisible, ReadItems

    The following roles apply specifically to calendar folders:

    - AvailabilityOnly: View only availability data
    - LimitedDetails: View availability data with subject and location

    When the Editor role is applied to calendar folders, delegates can accept or decline meetings by manually selecting the meeting request in the mailbox. In Exchange Online, to send meeting requests to delegates where they can accept or decline meetings, also use the SharingPermissionFlags parameter with the value Delegate.

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxFolderIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the target mailbox and folder. The syntax is `MailboxID:\ParentFolder[\SubFolder]`.

    For the value of `MailboxID`, you can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    Example values for this parameter are `john@contoso.com:\Calendar` or `John:\Inbox\Reports`.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SendNotificationToUser
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The SendNotificationToUser parameter specifies whether to send a sharing invitation to the user when you add calendar permissions for them. The message will be a normal calendar sharing invitation that can be accepted by the recipient. Valid values are:

    - $true: A sharing invitation is sent.
    - $false: No sharing invitation is sent. This is the default value.

    This parameter only applies to calendar folders and can only be used with the following AccessRights parameter values:

    - AvailabilityOnly
    - LimitedDetails
    - Reviewer
    - Editor

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxFolderPermissionFlags" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SharingPermissionFlags
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The SharingPermissionFlags parameter assigns calendar delegate permissions. This parameter only applies to calendar folders and can only be used when the AccessRights parameter value is Editor. Valid values are:

    - None: Has no effect. This is the default value.
    - Delegate: The user is made a calendar delegate, which includes receiving meeting invites and responses. If there are no other delegates, this value will create the meeting message rule. If there are existing delegates, the user is added to the meeting message rule without changing how delegate messages are sent.
    - CanViewPrivateItems: The user can access private items on the calendar. You must use this value with the Delegate value.

    You can specify multiple values separated by commas.

    **Note**: You can't configure the **Deliver meeting requests addressed to me and responses to meeting requests where I am the organizer to** Outlook setting in PowerShell. But, you can configure the setting using Exchange Web Services (EWS). For more information, see [MeetingRequestsDeliveryScope Enum](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.meetingrequestsdeliveryscope).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxFolderUserIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: User
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The User parameter specifies who's granted permission to the mailbox folder. Valid values are mail-enabled security principals (mail-enabled accounts or groups that have security identifiers or SIDs that can have permissions assigned to them). For example:

    - User mailboxes
    - Mail users
    - Mail-enabled security groups

    For the best results, we recommend using the following values:

    - UPN: For example, `user@contoso.com` (users only).
    - Domain\\SamAccountName: For example, `contoso\user`.

    Otherwise, you can use any value that uniquely identifies the user or group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
