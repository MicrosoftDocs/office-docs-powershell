parameters:
- type: <xref href="MailboxPolicyIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy
  description: |+
    The ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy parameter specifies the mobile device mailbox policy that's applied to the mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:.

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    If you don't use this parameter, the default mobile device mailbox policy is used.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="AddressBookMailboxPolicyIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AddressBookPolicy
  description: |+
    The AddressBookPolicy parameter specifies the address book policy that's applied to the mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the address book policy. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    For more information about address book policies, see [Address book policies in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/email-addresses-and-address-books/address-book-policies/address-book-policies).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Alias
  description: |+
    The Alias parameter specifies the Exchange alias (also known as the mail nickname) for the recipient. This value identifies the recipient as a mail-enabled object, and shouldn't be confused with multiple email addresses for the same recipient (also known as proxy addresses). A recipient can have only one Alias value. The maximum length is 64 characters.

    The Alias value can contain letters, numbers and the following characters:

    - !, #, %, \*, +, -, /, =, ?, ^, \_, and ~.
    - $, &, ', \`, {, }, and \| need to be escaped (for example ``-Alias what`'snew``) or the entire value enclosed in single quotation marks (for example, `-Alias 'what'snew'`). The & character is not supported in the Alias value for Microsoft Entra Connect synchronization.
    - Periods (.) must be surrounded by other valid characters (for example, `help.desk`).
    - Unicode characters U+00A1 to U+00FF.

    When you create a recipient without specifying an email address, the Alias value you specify is used to generate the primary email address (`alias@domain`). Supported Unicode characters are mapped to best-fit US-ASCII text characters. For example, U+00F6 (รถ) is changed to `oe` in the primary email address.

    If you don't use the Alias parameter when you create a recipient, the value of a different required parameter is used for the Alias property value:

    - Recipients with user accounts (for example, user mailboxes, and mail users): The left side of the MicrosoftOnlineServicesID or UserPrincipalName parameter is used. For example, helpdesk@contoso.onmicrosoft.com results in the Alias property value `helpdesk`.
    - Recipients without user accounts (for example, room mailboxes, mail contacts, and distribution groups): The value of the Name parameter is used. Spaces are removed and unsupported characters are converted to question marks (?).

    If you modify the Alias value of an existing recipient, the primary email address is automatically updated only in environments where the recipient is subject to email address policies (the EmailAddressPolicyEnabled property is True for the recipient).

    The Alias parameter never generates or updates the primary email address of a mail contact or a mail user.

  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: LinkedCredential
  description: |+
    The LinkedCredential parameter specifies the credentials used to access the domain controller that's specified by the LinkedDomainController parameter. This parameter is optional, even if you're connecting a linked mailbox.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter.

  name: User
  description: |+
    The User parameter specifies the user object in Active Directory that you want to connect the mailbox to.

    For the best results, we recommend using the following values:

    - UPN: For example, `user@contoso.com` (users only).
    - Domain\\SamAccountName: For example, `contoso\user`.

    Otherwise, you can use any value that uniquely identifies the user. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - GUID

    If you don't use this parameter, the command uses the LegacyExchangeDN and DisplayName property values of the mailbox to find a user account that has those same values. If it can't find a unique match, it doesn't connect the mailbox.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Connect-Mailbox
name: Connect-Mailbox
description: |-
  If you link a mailbox to an existing user account, that user account has full access to the mailbox and all mail in the mailbox.

  If you use the User parameter to specify the user account, make sure you specify the correct account. If you don't use the User parameter, we recommend that you use the ValidateOnly switch to verify which user account the mailbox will try to connect to.

  There is no Disconnect-Mailbox cmdlet. You can use the Disable-Mailbox or Remove-Mailbox cmdlets to effectively disconnect mailboxes from user accounts.

  Use the Disable-Mailbox cmdlet to:

  - Disconnect the mailbox from the user account.
  - Keep the mailbox in the disabled state before it's permanently deleted, subject to the deleted mailbox retention period.
  - Keep the user account, but remove the Exchange attributes from the account.

  Use the Remove-Mailbox cmdlet to:

  - Disconnect the mailbox from the user account.
  - Keep the mailbox in the disabled state before it's permanently deleted, subject to the deleted mailbox retention period (except if you use the Permanent or StoreMailboxIdentity parameters, which immediately deletes the mailbox from the database).
  - Remove the user account.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
