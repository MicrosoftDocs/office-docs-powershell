### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

  Use the Remove-ATPProtectionPolicyRule cmdlet to remove rules from Microsoft Defender for Office 365 protections in preset security policies. The rules specify recipient conditions and exceptions for the protection, and also allow you to turn on and turn off the associated preset security policies.

  **Note**: Use this cmdlet to remove a rule only if you plan to immediately recreate the rule using the New-ATPProtectionPolicyRule cmdlet. The affected preset security policy won't function without a corresponding rule.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the rule that you want to remove. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the rule. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    By default, the available rules (if they exist) are named Standard Preset Security Policy and Strict Preset Security Policy.

  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
