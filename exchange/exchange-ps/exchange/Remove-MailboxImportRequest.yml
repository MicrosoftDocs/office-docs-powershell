### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Remove-MailboxImportRequest cmdlet to remove fully or partially completed import requests. Completed import requests aren't automatically cleared. Requests need to be removed by using the Remove-MailboxImportRequest cmdlet. Multiple import requests can exist against the same mailbox if you provide a distinct import request name.

  NOTE: This cmdlet is no longer supported in Exchange Online. To import a .pst file in Exchange Online, see [Use network upload to import PST files](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/use-network-upload-to-import-pst-files).

  This cmdlet is available only in the Mailbox Import Export role, and by default, the role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use this cmdlet, you need to add the Mailbox Import Export role to a role group (for example, to the Organization Management role group). For more information, see [Add a role to a role group](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions/role-groups#add-a-role-to-a-role-group).

  Removing a partially completed import request removes the request from the Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Replication service (MRS) job queue. Any import progress that was made until the removal won't be reverted.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the identity of the import request. By default, import requests are named `<alias>\MailboxImportX` (where X = 0-9). If you created the request using the Name parameter, use the following syntax: `Alias\Name`.

    You can't use this parameter with the RequestGuid parameter.

  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The RequestGuid parameter (together with the RequestQueue parameter) specifies the unique identifier for the import request. To find the import request GUID, use the Get-MailboxImportRequest cmdlet.

  name: RequestQueue
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The RequestQueue parameter identifies the request based on the mailbox database where the request is being run. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
