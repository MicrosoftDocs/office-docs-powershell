parameters:
- type: <xref href="RecipientIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AddressForJournaling
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

    This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="EnhancedTimeSpan" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AgeLimitForRetention
  description: |+
    The AgeLimitForRetention parameter specifies the age at which retention is enforced on an item. The age limit corresponds to the number of days from the date the item was delivered, or the date an item was created if it wasn't delivered. If this parameter isn't present and the RetentionEnabled parameter is set to $true, an error is returned.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comment
  description: |+
    The Comment parameter specifies a comment for the tag.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    The LocalizedComment parameter specifies localized comments and their languages. When the user's language setting matches a language specified for this parameter, Microsoft Outlook and Outlook on the web display the corresponding localized comment.

  name: MessageClass
  description: |+
    The MessageClass parameter specifies the message type to which the tag applies. If not specified, the default value is set to \*.

    With the exception of a default policy tag (DPT) for voicemail, Exchange doesn't support retention tags for different message types. Only tags with a MessageClass of \* are supported, and they apply to all message types.

    To create a DPT for voice mail messages, set the MessageClass parameter to voicemail and the Type parameter to All.

    A DPT for voice mail messages applies only to Microsoft Exchange Unified Messaging voice mail messages (identified by the PR\_MESSAGE\_CLASS MAPI property value IPM.Note.Microsoft.Voicemail\*).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RetentionAction" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RetentionAction
  description: |+
    The RetentionAction parameter specifies the action for the retention policy. Valid values are:

    - DeleteAndAllowRecovery: Deletes a message and allows recovery from the Recoverable Items folder.
    - MarkAsPastRetentionLimit: Messages are marked as past the retention limit.
    - MoveToArchive: Moves a message to the user's archive mailbox. You can use this action for retention tags of type All, Personal and RecoverableItems.
    - PermanentlyDelete: Permanently deletes a message. A message that has been permanently deleted can't be recovered using the Recoverable Items folder. Permanently deleted messages aren't returned in a Discovery search, unless litigation hold is enabled for the mailbox.

    The MoveToDeletedItems and MoveToFolder actions are available, but don't work. These actions are available for upgrades from messaging records management (MRM) 1.0 (managed folders) to MRM 2.0 (retention policies). MRM 2.0 was introduced in Exchange 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1).

    If this parameter isn't present and the RetentionEnabled parameter is set to $true, an error is returned.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RetentionEnabled
  description: |+
    The RetentionEnabled parameter specifies whether the tag is enabled. When set to $false, the tag is disabled, and no retention action is taken on messages that have the tag applied.

    Messages with a disabled tag are still considered tagged, so any tags of the same type as the disabled tag in the user's retention policy aren't applied to such messages.

    When you set the RetentionEnabled parameter to $false, the retention period for the tag is shown as Never. Users may apply this tag to items they want to indicate should never be deleted or should never be moved to the archive. Enabling the tag later may result in unintentional deletion or archiving of items. To avoid this situation, if a retention policy is disabled temporarily, it may be advisable to change the name of that tag so that users are discouraged from using it, such as `DISABLED_<Original Name>`.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RetentionId
  description: |+
    The RetentionId parameter specifies an alternate tag ID to make sure the retention tag found on mailbox items tagged in an on-premises deployment matches the tag when the mailbox is moved to the cloud, or mailbox items tagged in the cloud match the tag when the mailbox is moved to an on-premises Exchange server. The parameter is used in cross-premises deployments. You don't need to specify this parameter in on-premises-only deployments.
