  Service principals exist in Microsoft Entra ID to define what apps can do, who can access the apps, and what resources the apps can access. In Exchange Online, service principals are references to the service principals in Microsoft Entra ID. To assign Exchange Online role-based access control (RBAC) roles to service principals in Microsoft Entra ID, you use the service principal references in Exchange Online. The **\*-ServicePrincipal** cmdlets in Exchange Online PowerShell let you view, create, and remove these service principal references.

  For more information, see [Application and service principal objects in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals).
