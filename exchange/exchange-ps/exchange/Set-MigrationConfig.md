# Set-MigrationConfig

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Set-MigrationConfig cmdlet to edit migration configurations on Exchange servers.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-MigrationConfig
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Features <MigrationFeature>]
 [-MaxConcurrentMigrations <Unlimited>]
 [-MaxNumberOfBatches <Int32>]
 [-Partition <MailboxIdParameter>]
 [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-MigrationConfig -MaxNumberOfBatches 50
```

This example sets the migration system to have a maximum of 50 batches at any time.

### Example 2
```powershell
Set-MigrationConfig -MaxConcurrentMigrations 100
```

This example sets the migration system to only allow 100 concurrent migrations.

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.
