### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

  Use the New-RpcClientAccess cmdlet to create configuration information for the Exchange RPC Client Access service on a Client Access server. This set up task is performed by default on new installations of the Client Access server role on Microsoft Exchange Server 2010.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BlockedClientVersions
  description: |+
    The BlockedClientVersions parameter specifies which versions of Microsoft Outlook are restricted from connecting. The Exchange RPC Client Access service rejects Outlook connections if versions are in the range specified. This setting affects MAPI and Outlook Anywhere client connections. The value must be less than 256 characters in length.

    Versions should be single numbers in the format X.Y.Z where X is a major version number, Y is the minor revision number, and Z specifies the build, and ranges should be delimited by semicolons (for example, 0.0.0-5.9.9; 7.0.0-65535.65535.65535).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf

  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EncryptionRequired
  description: |+
    The EncryptionRequired parameter specifies whether to require Outlook connections to be encrypted. The Exchange RPC Client Access service rejects unencrypted Outlook connections if this parameter is set to $true.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaximumConnections
  description: |+
    The MaximumConnections parameter specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections allowed. The Exchange RPC Client Access service reads and limits connections based on this property.

    This parameter has a range from 1 through 65535.

    Although you can configure a non-default value for this parameter, changes to this setting aren't enforced in this version of Exchange.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Server parameter specifies the Client Access server where you want to run this command. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - ExchangeLegacyDN

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
