parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

name: Enable-UMCallAnsweringRule
description: |-
  The Enable-UMCallAnsweringRule cmdlet enables the call answering rule by modifying its status variable. When the call answering rule is created, it's enabled. This cmdlet allows you to enable a previously disabled call answering rule. Enabling a call answering rule enables the cmdlet to retrieve the call answering rule including the conditions and actions for a specified call answering rule.

  After this task is completed, the cmdlet sets the parameters and values specified. When you enable a call answering rule, the call answering rule is processed when an incoming call is received.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
