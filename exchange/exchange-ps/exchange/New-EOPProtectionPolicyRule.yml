### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

  Use the New-EOPProtectionPolicyRule cmdlet to create rules for Exchange Online Protection (EOP) protections in preset security policies. The rules specify recipient conditions and exceptions for the protection, and also allow you to turn on and turn off the associated preset security policies.

  **Note**: Unless you manually removed a rule using the Remove-EOPProtectionPolicyRule cmdlet, we don't recommend using this cmdlet to create rules. To create the rule, you need to specify the existing individual security policies that are associated with the preset security policy. We never recommend creating these required individual security policies manually. Turning on the preset security policy for the first time in the Microsoft Defender portal automatically creates the required individual security policies, but also creates the associated rules using this cmdlet. So, if the rules already exist, you don't need to use this cmdlet to create them.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="AntiPhishPolicyIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AntiPhishPolicy
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The AntiPhishPolicy parameter specifies the existing anti-phishing policy that's associated with the preset security policy.

    If you ever turned on the preset security policy in the Microsoft Defender portal, the name of the anti-phishing policy will be one of the following values:

    - Standard Preset Security Policy\<13-digit number\>. For example, `Standard Preset Security Policy1622650005393`.
    - Strict Preset Security Policy\<13-digit number\>. For example, `Strict Preset Security Policy1642034844713`.

    You can find the anti-phishing policy that's used by the Standard or Strict preset security policies by running the following commands: `Get-AntiPhishPolicy | Where-Object -Property RecommendedPolicyType -eq -Value "Standard"` or `AntiPhishPolicy | Where-Object -Property RecommendedPolicyType -eq -Value "Strict"`.

  name: Comments
  description: |+
    The Comments parameter specifies informative comments for the rule, such as what the rule is used for or how it has changed over time. The length of the comment can't exceed 1024 characters.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    The Enabled parameter specifies whether the rule is enabled. Valid values are:

    - $true: The rule is enabled. The State value of the rule is Enabled. This is the default value.
    - $false: The rule is disabled. The State value of the rule is Disabled.

    After you create the rule, you turn on or turn off the preset security policy using one of the following commands:

    - Turn off: Disable-EOPProtectionPolicyRule.
    - Turn on: Enable-EOPProtectionPolicyRule.

    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

    If you remove the group after you create the rule, no exception is made for messages that are sent to members of the group.

  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the rule. The maximum length is 64 characters.

    By default, the rules are named Standard Preset Security Policy or Strict Preset Security Policy.
