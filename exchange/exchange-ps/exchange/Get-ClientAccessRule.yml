### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  > [!NOTE]
  > Beginning in October 2022, we've disabled access to client access rules for all existing Exchange Online organizations that weren't using them. In September 2024, support for client access rules will end for all Exchange Online organizations. For more information, see [Update: Deprecation of Client Access Rules in Exchange Online](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/update-deprecation-of-client-access-rules-in-exchange-online/ba-p/3790165).

  This cmdlet is functional only in Exchange Server 2019 and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Get-ClientAccessRule cmdlet to view client access rules. Client access rules help you control access to your cloud-based organization based on the properties of the connection.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  Client access rules are like mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) for client connections to your organization. You use conditions and exceptions to identify the connections based on their properties, and actions that allow or block the connections.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you.
