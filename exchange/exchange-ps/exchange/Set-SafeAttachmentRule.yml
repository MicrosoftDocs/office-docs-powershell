parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comments
  description: |+
    The Comments parameter specifies informative comments for the rule, such as what the rule is used for or how it has changed over time. The length of the comment can't exceed 1024 characters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs
  description: |+
    The ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients with email addresses in the specified domains. You can specify multiple domains separated by commas.

  defaultValue: None

  name: ExceptIfSentTo
  description: |+
    The ExceptIfSentTo parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients in messages. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RecipientIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ExceptIfSentToMemberOf
  description: |+
    The ExceptIfSentToMemberOf parameter specifies an exception that looks for messages sent to members of distribution groups, mail-enabled security groups, or sent to Microsoft 365 Groups. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

    If you remove the group after you create the rule, no exception is made for messages that are sent to members of the group.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RuleIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the safe attachment rule that you want to modify.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the rule. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the safe attachment rule. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Priority
  description: |+
    The Priority parameter specifies a priority value for the rule that determines the order of rule processing. A lower integer value indicates a higher priority, the value 0 is the highest priority, and rules can't have the same priority value.

    Valid values and the default value for this parameter depend on the number of existing rules. For example, if there are 8 existing rules:

    - Valid priority values for the existing 8 rules are from 0 through 7.
    - Valid priority values for a new rule (the 9th rule) are from 0 through 8.
    - The default value for a new rule (the 9th rule) is 8.

    If you modify the priority value of a rule, the position of the rule in the list changes to match the priority value you specify. In other words, if you set the priority value of a rule to the same value as an existing rule, the priority value of the existing rule and all other lower priority rules after it is increased by 1.

  name: RecipientDomainIs

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SafeAttachmentPolicyIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SafeAttachmentPolicy
  description: |+
    The SafeAttachmentPolicy parameter specifies the safe attachment policy that's associated with this safe attachment rule. The rule defines the conditions, and the policy defines the actions.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't specify a safe attachment policy that's already associated with another safe attachment rule.

    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

  Safe Attachments is a feature in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that opens email attachments in a special hypervisor environment to detect malicious activity. For more information, see [Safe Attachments in Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments-about).

  A safe attachment policy can be assigned only to one safe attachment rule.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Different types of recipient conditions or different types of recipient exceptions are not additive; they're inclusive. For more information, see [Safe Attachments policy settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments#safe-attachments-policy-settings).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
