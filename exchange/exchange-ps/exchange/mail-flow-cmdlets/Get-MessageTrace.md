## SYNTAX

```
Get-MessageTrace [-EndDate <DateTime>] [-Expression <Expression>] [-FromIP <String>]
 [-MessageId <MultiValuedProperty>] [-MessageTraceId <Guid>] [-Page <Int32>] [-PageSize <Int32>]
 [-ProbeTag <String>] [-RecipientAddress <MultiValuedProperty>] [-SenderAddress <MultiValuedProperty>]
 [-StartDate <DateTime>] [-Status <MultiValuedProperty>] [-ToIP <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You can use this cmdlet to search message data for the last 7 days. If you run this cmdlet without any parameters, only data from the last 48 hours is returned.

This cmdlet returns a maximum of 1000000 results, and will timeout on very large queries. If your query returns too many results, consider splitting it up using smaller StartDate and EndDate intervals.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
Get-MessageTrace -SenderAddress john@contoso.com -StartDate 06/13/2015 -EndDate 06/15/2015
```

This example retrieves message trace information for messages sent by john@contoso.com between June 13, 2015 and June 15, 2015.
