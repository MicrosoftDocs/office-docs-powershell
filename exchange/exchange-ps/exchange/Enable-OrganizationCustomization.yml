parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  In the Microsoft datacenters, certain objects are consolidated to save space. When you use Exchange Online PowerShell or the Exchange admin center to modify one of these objects for the first time, you may encounter an error message that tells you to run the Enable-OrganizationCustomization cmdlet.

  Here are some examples of when you might see this:

  - Creating a new role group or creating a new management role assignment.
  - Creating a new role assignment policy or modifying a built-in role assignment policy.
  - Creating a new Outlook on the web mailbox policy or modifying a built-in Outlook on the web mailbox policy.
  - Creating a new sharing policy or modifying a built-in sharing policy.
  - Creating a new retention policy or modifying a built-in retention policy.
  - Enabling preset security policies in the Microsoft Defender portal.

  Note that you are only required to run the Enable-OrganizationCustomization cmdlet once in your Exchange Online organization. If you attempt to run the cmdlet again, you'll get an error.

  Whether or not this command has been previously run in an organization is available in the IsDehydrated property of the Get-OrganizationConfig cmdlet: False ($false) = the command has already been run; True ($true) = the command has never been run.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet.
