  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Remove-MoveRequest
name: Remove-MoveRequest
description: |-
  In coexistence environments with Exchange 2010 and newer versions of Exchange, don't run a newer version of Remove-MoveRequest to clear completed mailbox move requests between Exchange 2010 databases as documented in [Clear or Remove Move Requests](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2010/dd351276(v=exchg.141)). Otherwise, you might delete the mailbox that you just moved. In coexistence environments, only use the Remove-MoveRequest cmdlet on Exchange 2010 servers to clear completed Exchange 2010 move requests. For mailbox moves from an Exchange 2010 database to an Exchange 2016 database, you can safely run Remove-MoveRequest on the Exchange 2016 server.

  In Exchange 2010, you need to use the Remove-MoveRequest cmdlet on completed move requests to clear the InTransit flag from the mailbox. This step isn't required for mailbox moves in newer versions of Exchange where the Remove-MoveRequest is only used to cancel existing move requests.

  The MoveRequestQueue and MailboxGuid parameters are for debugging purposes only.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
