examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    Set-ActiveSyncDeviceAutoblockThreshold -Identity "UserAgentChanges" BehaviorTypeIncidenceLimit 2 -BehaviorTypeIncidenceDuration 1440 -DeviceBlockDuration 1440 -AdminEmailInsert "<B>Your device has been blocked.</B> "]
  description: |-
    This example sets the autoblock threshold rule UserAgentChanges with several settings. It limits the number of accepted UserAgent changes to 2, specifies that the incidence duration is 1440 minutes and blocks the mobile device for 1440 minutes. Lastly, it inserts a message into the administrative email message sent to the user.

- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Set-ActiveSyncDeviceAutoblockThreshold -Identity "RecentCommands" BehaviorTypeIncidenceLimit 5 -BehaviorTypeIncidenceDuration 720 -DeviceBlockDuration 720 -AdminEmailInsert "<B>Your device has been blocked.</B> "]
  description: |-
    This example sets the autoblock threshold rule RecentCommands with several settings. It limits the number of accepted RecentCommands changes to 5, specifies that the incidence duration is 720 minutes and blocks the mobile device for 720 minutes. Lastly, it inserts a message into the administrative email message sent to the user.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AdminEmailInsert
  description: |+
    The AdminEmailInsert parameter specifies the text to include in the email sent to the user when a mobile device triggers an autoblock threshold rule.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="EnhancedTimeSpan" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BehaviorTypeIncidenceDuration
  description: |+
    The BehaviorTypeIncidenceDuration parameter specifies the interval (in minutes) within which the BehaviorType must occur to trigger the autoblock rule.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BehaviorTypeIncidenceLimit
  description: |+
    The BehaviorTypeIncidenceLimit parameter specifies the number of occurrences of the behavior type needed to trigger blocking.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2013

  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""

  name: DeviceBlockDuration
  description: |+
    The DeviceBlockDuration parameter specifies the length of time (in minutes) that the mobile device is blocked.

  defaultValue: None

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

description: |-
  Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync can block Exchange ActiveSync mobile devices if these devices display any of a defined list of behaviors that can potentially cause issues with the server. The Set-ActiveSyncDeviceAutoblockThreshold cmdlet can modify an existing autoblock threshold rule and change a variety of settings including the duration of blocking.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet.
