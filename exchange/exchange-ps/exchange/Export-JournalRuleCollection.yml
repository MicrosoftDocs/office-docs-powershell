  code: |-
    $file = Export-JournalRuleCollection

    [System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes('C:\MyDocs\JournalRules.xml', $file.FileData)
  description: |-
    This example exports journal rules in a two-step process. In the first step, the Export-JournalRuleCollection cmdlet exports journal rules to the variable $file. In the second step, the Set-Content cmdlet saves the exported data to the XML file JournalRules.xml.

- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    $file = Export-JournalRuleCollection -ExportLegacyRules

    [System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes('C:\MyDocs\LegacyJournalRules.xml', $file.FileData)
  description: |-
    In Exchange Server 2010, this example exports legacy journal rules that were created in Exchange 2007 to an XML file. The first command uses the ExportLegacyRules switch to export legacy journal rules to the variable named $file. The second step saves the exported data to the XML file named LegacyJournalRules.xml.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
