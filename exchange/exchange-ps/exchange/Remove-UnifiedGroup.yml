  This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

  Use the Remove-UnifiedGroup cmdlet to remove Microsoft 365 Groups from your cloud-based organization.

  **Note**: You can't use this cmdlet to remove Microsoft 365 Groups if you connect using certificate based authentication (also known as CBA or app-only authentication for unattended scripts) or Azure managed identity.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

    The Identity parameter specifies the Microsoft 365 Group that you want to remove. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the Microsoft 365 Group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

  name: WhatIf
