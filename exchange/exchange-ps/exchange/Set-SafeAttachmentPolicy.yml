  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SafeAttachmentAction" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Action
  description: |+
    The Action parameter specifies the action for the safe attachment policy. Valid values are:

    - Allow: Deliver the message if malware is detected in the attachment and track scanning results. This value corresponds to **Monitor** for the **Safe Attachments unknown malware response** property of the policy in the admin center.
    - Block: Block the email message that contains the malware attachment. This is the default value.
    - DynamicDelivery: Deliver the email message with a placeholder for each email attachment. The placeholder remains until a copy of the attachment is scanned and determined to be safe. For more information, see [Dynamic Delivery in Safe Attachments policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments-about#dynamic-delivery-in-safe-attachments-policies).

    The value of this parameter is meaningful only when the value of the Enable parameter is $true (the default value is $false).

    To specify no action for the safe attachment policy (corresponds to the value **Off** for the **Safe Attachments unknown malware response** policy setting in the admin center), use the value $false for the Enable parameter.

    The results of all actions are available in message trace.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AdminDisplayName
  description: |+
    The AdminDisplayName parameter specifies a description for the policy. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enable
  description: |+
    The Enable parameter works with the Action parameter to specify the action for the safe attachment policy. Valid values are:

    - $true: The Action parameter specifies the action for the safe attachment policy.
    - $false: This is the default value. Attachments are not scanned by Safe Attachments, regardless of the value of the Action parameter. $false corresponds to the value **Off** for the **Safe Attachments unknown malware response** setting of the complete Safe Attachments policy in the Microsoft Defender portal (the combination of the rule and the corresponding associated policy in PowerShell).

    To enable or disable an existing Safe Attachments policy, use the Enable-SafeAttachmentRule or Disable-SafeAttachmentRule cmdlets.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SafeAttachmentPolicyIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the safe attachment policy that you want to modify.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: QuarantineTag
  description: |+
    The QuarantineTag parameter specifies the quarantine policy that's used on messages that are quarantined as malware by Safe Attachments. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the quarantine policy. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    Quarantine policies define what users are able to do to quarantined messages based on why the message was quarantined and quarantine notification settings. For more information about quarantine policies, see [Quarantine policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/quarantine-policies).

    The default value for this parameter is the built-in quarantine policy named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy. This quarantine policy enforces the historical capabilities for messages that were quarantined as malware by Safe Attachments as described in the table [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/quarantine-end-user).

    To view the list of available quarantine policies, run the following command: `Get-QuarantinePolicy | Format-List Name,EndUser*,ESNEnabled`.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Redirect
  description: |+
    The Redirect parameter specifies whether to deliver messages to an alternate email address if malware is detected in an attachment. Valid values are:

    - $true: Messages that contain malware attachments are delivered to the email address specified by the RedirectAddress parameter.
    - $false: Messages that contain malware attachments aren't delivered to another email address. This is the default value.

    **Note**: Redirection will soon be available only for the Allow action. For more information, see [MC424899](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC424899).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SmtpAddress" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RedirectAddress
  description: |+
    The RedirectAddress parameter specifies the destination email address to deliver messages if malware is detected in an attachment.

    The value of this parameter is meaningful only when value of the Redirect parameter is $true and the value of the Action parameter is Allow.

    **Note**: Redirection will soon be available only for the Allow action. For more information, see [MC424899](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC424899).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    **Note**: Redirection will soon be available only for the Allow action. For more information, see [MC424899](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC424899).

  Safe Attachments is a feature in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that opens email attachments in a special hypervisor environment to detect malicious activity. For more information, see [Safe Attachments in Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments-about).

  A safe attachment policy can be assigned to only one safe attachment rule by using the SafeAttachmentPolicy parameter on the New-SafeAttachmentRule or Set-SafeAttachmentRule cmdlets.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
