  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="AutoDatabaseMountDial" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AutoDatabaseMountDial
  description: |+
    The AutoDatabaseMountDial parameter specifies the automatic database mount behavior for a continuous replication environment after a database failover on the Mailbox server. You can use the following values:

    - BestAvailability: The database automatically mounts immediately after a failover if the copy queue length is less than or equal to 12. The copy queue length is the number of logs recognized by the passive copy that needs to be replicated. If the copy queue length is more than 12, the database doesn't automatically mount. When the copy queue length is less than or equal to 12, Exchange attempts to replicate the remaining logs to the passive copy and mounts the database.
    - GoodAvailability: The database automatically mounts immediately after a failover if the copy queue length is less than or equal to six. The copy queue length is the number of logs recognized by the passive copy that needs to be replicated. If the copy queue length is more than six, the database doesn't automatically mount. When the copy queue length is less than or equal to six, Exchange attempts to replicate the remaining logs to the passive copy and mounts the database.
    - Lossless: The database doesn't automatically mount until all logs that were generated on the active copy have been copied to the passive copy. This setting also causes Active Manager's best copy selection algorithm to sort potential candidates for activation based on the database copy's activation preference value and not its copy queue length.

    The default value is GoodAvailability. If you specify either BestAvailability or GoodAvailability, and all of the logs from the active copy haven't been replicated to the passive copy, you may lose some mailbox data. However, the Safety Net feature, (which is enabled by default) helps protect against data loss by resubmitting messages that are in Safety Net.

  name: CalendarRepairIntervalEndWindow
  description: |+
    The CalendarRepairIntervalEndWindow parameter specifies the number of days into the future to repair calendar items in mailboxes on the Mailbox server.

    The default value in Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019 is 7. This value means the Calendar Repair Assistant repairs meetings in calendars up to 7 days from now. Meetings that are scheduled to occur more than 7 days in the future aren't repaired.

    The default value in Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2010 is 30. This value means the Calendar Repair Assistant repairs meetings in calendars up to 30 days from now. Meetings that are scheduled to occur more than 30 days in the future aren't repaired.

  name: CalendarRepairLogDirectorySizeLimit
  description: |+
    The CalendarRepairLogDirectorySizeLimit parameter specifies the maximum size of calendar repair log directory on the Mailbox server. When the directory reaches its maximum size, the server deletes the oldest log files first.

    Calendar repair log files begin with the name prefix CRA. The maximum size of the calendar repair log directory is calculated as the total size of all log files that have the CRA name prefix. Other files aren't counted in the total directory size calculation. Renaming old log files or copying other files into the calendar repair log directory could cause the directory to exceed its specified maximum size.

    The default value is 500 megabytes (MB).

    When you enter a value, qualify the value with one of the following units:

    - B (bytes)
    - KB (kilobytes)
    - MB (megabytes)
    - GB (gigabytes)
    - TB (terabytes)

    Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte.

    If you enter the value unlimited, no size limit is imposed on the calendar repair log directory.

  name: CalendarRepairLogFileAgeLimit
  description: |+
    The CalendarRepairLogFileAgeLimit parameter specifies the calendar repair log maximum file age on the Mailbox server. Log files older than the specified value are deleted. The default value is 10 days.

    To specify a value, enter it as a time span: dd.hh:mm:ss where dd = days, hh = hours, mm = minutes, and ss = seconds.

    For example, to specify 30 days, enter 30.00:00:00. The value 00:00:00 prevents the automatic removal of calendar repair log files because of their age.

  name: CalendarRepairSchedule
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

    The CalendarRepairSchedule parameter specifies the intervals each week during which the Calendar Repair Assistant applies checks for calendar failures.

    The syntax for this parameter is: `StartDay.Hour:Minute [AM | PM]-EndDay.Hour:Minute [AM | PM]`. You can specify multiple schedules separated by commas: `"Schedule1","Schedule2",..."ScheduleN"`.

    You can use the following values for days:

    - Full name of the day.
    - Abbreviated name of the day.
    - Integer from 0 through 6, where 0 = Sunday.

    You can enter the time in 24 hour format and omit the AM/PM value. If you enter the time in 12 time hour format, include a space between the time and the AM/PM value.

    You can mix and match date/time formats.

    The start time and end time must be at least 15 minutes apart. Minutes are rounded down to 0, 15, 30, or 45. If you specify more than one interval, there must be at least 15 minutes between each interval.

    Here are some examples:

    - "Sun.11:30 PM-Mon.1:30 AM"
    - "6.22:00-6.22:15" (Run from Saturday at 10:00 PM until Saturday at 10:15 PM.)
    - "Sun.1:15 AM-Monday.23:00"
    - "Monday.4:30 AM-Monday.5:30 AM","Wednesday.4:30 AM-Wednesday.5:30 AM" (Run on Monday and Wednesday mornings from 4:30 until 5:30.)

    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    The DatabaseCopyActivationDisabledAndMoveNow parameter specifies whether to prevent databases from being mounted on this Mailbox server if there are other healthy copies of the databases on other Mailbox servers. It will also immediately move any mounted databases on the server to other servers if copies exist and are healthy.

    Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false. The default value is $false.

    Setting this parameter to $true won't cause databases to move to a server that has the DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy parameter set to Blocked.

  name: DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy
  description: |+
    The DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy parameter specifies the type of automatic activation available for mailbox database copies on the specified Mailbox server. Valid values for this parameter are:

    - Blocked: Databases can't be automatically activated on the specified Mailbox server. In Exchange 2013 prior to Cumulative Update 7 (CU7), this setting stops server locator requests to the specified server, which prevents all client access to manually activated databases on the server if all DAG members are configured with a value of Blocked. In Exchange 2013 CU7 or later versions of Exchange, server locator requests are sent to a blocked server if no other Mailbox servers are available, thus client access is not impacted.
    - IntrasiteOnly: The database copy is allowed to be activated only on Mailbox servers in the same Active Directory site. This prevents cross-site failover and activation.
    - Unrestricted: There are no special restrictions on activating mailbox database copies on the specified Mailbox server. This is the default value.

  name: FolderLogForManagedFoldersEnabled
  description: |+
    This parameter is used for coexistence with Exchange 2010. Specifically, this parameter works with messaging records management (MRM) 1.0 (managed folders). This parameter doesn't work with MRM 2.0 (retention policies) that were introduced in Exchange 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1).

    The FolderLogForManagedFoldersEnabled parameter specifies whether managed folder logging is enabled on the Mailbox server. Valid input for this parameter is$true or $false. The default value is $false.

    If you specify $true, managed folder logging is enabled. Message activity in folders that have managed folder mailbox policies applied to them is logged.

    The value of this parameter affects the following parameters:

    - JournalingLogForManagedFoldersEnabled
    - LogDirectorySizeLimitForManagedFolders
    - LogFileAgeLimitForManagedFolders
    - LogFileSizeLimitForManagedFolders

    The ForceGroupMetricsGeneration parameter specifies that group metrics information must be generated on the Mailbox server regardless of whether that server generates an offline address book (OAB). Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false. The default value is $false.

    By default, group metrics are generated only on servers that generate OABs. Group metrics information is used by MailTips to inform senders about how many recipients their messages will be sent to. You need to set this parameter to $true if your organization doesn't generate OABs and you want the group metrics data to be available.

    The LogDirectorySizeLimitForManagedFolders parameter specifies the maximum size of all managed folder logs from a single mailbox database in the managed folder log directory on the Mailbox server. When a set of log files reaches its maximum size, the server deletes the oldest log files first.

    Every mailbox database on the server uses a different log file name prefix (for example, `Managed_Folder_Assistant<Mailbox database name>`). Therefore, the maximum size of the managed folder log directory is the number of mailbox databases multiplied by the value of the LogDirectorySizeLimitForManagedFolders parameter. Other files aren't counted in the total size calculation. Renaming old log files or copying other files into the managed folder log directory could cause the directory to exceed its specified maximum size.

    When you enter a value, qualify the value with one of the following units:

    - B (bytes)
    - KB (kilobytes)
    - MB (megabytes)
    - GB (gigabytes)
    - TB (terabytes)

    Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte.

For more information, see [Configure and run the Managed Folder Assistant in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/mrm/configure-managed-folder-assistant).

    The ManagedFolderAssistantSchedule parameter specifies the intervals each week during which the Managed Folder Assistant applies messaging records management (MRM) settings to managed folders in mailboxes on the Mailbox server.

    The syntax for this parameter is: `StartDay.Hour:Minute [AM | PM]-EndDay.Hour:Minute [AM | PM]`. You can specify multiple schedules separated by commas: `"Schedule1","Schedule2",..."ScheduleN"`.

    You can use the following values for days:

    - Full name of the day.
    - Abbreviated name of the day.
    - Integer from 0 through 6, where 0 = Sunday.

    You can enter the time in 24 hour format and omit the AM/PM value. If you enter the time in 12 time hour format, include a space between the time and the AM/PM value.

    You can mix and match date/time formats.

    The start time and end time must be at least 15 minutes apart. Minutes are rounded down to 0, 15, 30, or 45. If you specify more than one interval, there must be at least 15 minutes between each interval.

    Here are some examples:

    - "Sun.11:30 PM-Mon.1:30 AM"
    - "6.22:00-6.22:15" (Run from Saturday at 10:00 PM until Saturday at 10:15 PM.)
    - "Sun.1:15 AM-Monday.23:00"
    - "Monday.4:30 AM-Monday.5:30 AM","Wednesday.4:30 AM-Wednesday.5:30 AM" (Run on Monday and Wednesday mornings from 4:30 until 5:30.)

    If the Managed Folder Assistant doesn't finish processing the mailboxes on the server during the time that you've scheduled, it automatically resumes processing where it left off the next time it runs.

Renaming old log files or copying other files into the message tracking log directory could cause the directory to exceed its specified maximum size.

    When the Hub Transport server role and the Mailbox server role are installed on the same server, the maximum size of the message tracking log directory isn't the specified maximum size because the message tracking log files generated by the different server roles have different name prefixes. Message tracking log files for the Hub Transport server role or Edge Transport server role begin with the name prefix MSGTRK. Message tracking log files for the Mailbox server role begin with the name prefix MSGTRKM. When the Hub Transport server role and the Mailbox server role are installed on the same server, the maximum size of the message tracking log directory is two times the specified value.

    The default value is 250 MB. When you enter a value, qualify the value with one of the following units:

    - B (bytes)
    - KB (kilobytes)
    - MB (megabytes)
    - GB (gigabytes)
    - TB (terabytes)

    Unqualified values are treated as bytes. The value of the MessageTrackingLogMaxFileSize parameter must be less than or equal to the value of the MessageTrackingLogMaxDirectorySize parameter. The valid input range for either parameter is from 1 through 9223372036854775807 bytes.

    The MessageTrackingLogMaxFileSize parameter specifies the maximum size of the message tracking log files. When a log file reaches its maximum file size, a new log file is created. The default value is 10 MB. When you enter a value, qualify the value with one of the following units:

    - B (bytes)
    - KB (kilobytes)

    Also, as mailboxes are prioritized, existing mailboxes that haven't been successfully processed for a long time will be placed higher in the queue and will have a greater chance of being processed again in the same work cycle.

    To specify a value, enter it as a time span: dd.hh:mm:ss where d = days, h = hours, m = minutes and s = seconds.

    For example, to specify 2 days for this parameter, use 2.00:00:00. The TopN Words Assistant will then process all mailboxes on this server every 2 days.

    This parameter is available only in Exchange Server 2010 or Exchange Server 2013.

    The UMReportingWorkCycle parameter specifies the time span in which the arbitration mailbox named SystemMailbox{e0dc1c29-89c3-4034-b678-e6c29d823ed9} on the Mailbox server will be scanned by the Unified Messaging Reporting Assistant. The default value is 1 day.

    The Unified Messaging Reporting Assistant updates the Call Statistics reports by reading Unified Messaging call data records for an organization on a regular basis.

    To specify a value, enter it as a time span: dd.hh:mm:ss where d = days, h = hours, m = minutes, and s = seconds.

    For example, to specify 2 days for this parameter, use 2.00:00:00. The Unified Messaging Reporting Assistant will then process all mailboxes that have Unified Messaging enabled on this server every 2 days.

    Changing the default work cycle for this assistant might impact the performance of the Mailbox server.
