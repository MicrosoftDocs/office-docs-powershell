  description: |-
    This example defines the credentials that are used to update the hybrid configuration object and connect to the Microsoft 365 for enterprises organization.

    Use the first command to specify your on-premises organization credentials. For example, run this command and enter `<domain>\admin@contoso.com` and the associated password in the resulting Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box.

    Use the second command to specify your Microsoft 365 organization credentials. For example, run this command and then enter `admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com` and the associated account password in the resulting Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box.

    Use the last command to define the credentials that are used to update the hybrid configuration object and connect to the Microsoft 365 organization.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForceUpgrade
  description: |+
    The ForceUpgrade switch suppresses the confirmation message that appears if the object was created in a previous version of Exchange. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This confirmation prompt is displayed only when the existing HybridConfiguration Active Directory object version is Exchange 2010.

  name: OnPremisesCredentials
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The OnPremisesCredentials parameter specifies the on-premises Active Directory account and password that's used to configure the hybrid configuration object. This account must be a member of the Organization Management role group.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

  name: TenantCredentials
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The TenantCredentials parameter specifies the Microsoft 365 organization account and password that's used to configure the hybrid configuration object. This is often the administrator account that's assigned when the Microsoft 365 organization was created. This account must be a member of the Global admin role.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter.
