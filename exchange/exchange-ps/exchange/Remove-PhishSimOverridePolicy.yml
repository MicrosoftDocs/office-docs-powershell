parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the phishing simulation override policy that you want to remove. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

    - Name
    - Id
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    Use the Get-PhishSimOverridePolicy cmdlet to find the values. The only available policy is named PhishSimOverridePolicy.

  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    In Exchange Online PowerShell, the WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    The WhatIf switch doesn't work in Security & Compliance PowerShell.
