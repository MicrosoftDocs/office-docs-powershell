# Update-EOPDistributionGroupMember

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Online Protection.

Use the Update-EOPDistributionGroupMember cmdlet to add or remove members from distribution groups and mail-enabled security groups in Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP) standalone. This cmdlet isn't available in Exchange Enterprise CAL with Services (EOP Premium). In EOP Premium, use the Update-DistributionGroupMember cmdlet.

Typically, EOP standalone customers that also have on-premises Active Directory organizations would use directory synchronization to create users and groups in EOP. However, if you can't use directory synchronization, then you can use cmdlets to create and manage users and groups in EOP.

This cmdlet uses a batch processing method that results in a propagation delay of a few minutes before the results of the cmdlet are visible.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Update-EOPDistributionGroupMember [-ExternalDirectoryObjectId <String>]
 [-Identity <DistributionGroupIdParameter>] [-Members <String[]>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Update-EOPDistributionGroupMember -Identity "Security Team" -Members @("Kitty Petersen","Tyson Fawcett")
```

This example replaces the current members of the Security Team distribution group with Kitty Petersen and Tyson Fawcett.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
$CurrentMemberObjects = Get-DistributionGroupMember "Security Team"; $CurrentMemberNames = $CurrentMemberObjects | % {$_.name}; $CurrentMemberNames += "Tyson Fawcett"; Update-EOPDistributionGroupMember -Identity "Security Team" -Members $CurrentMemberNames
```

This example adds a new user named Tyson Fawcett to the distribution group named Security Team while preserving the current members of the group. The current member objects are retrieved in a collection, the collection is filtered to extract the names, the user "Tyson Fawcett" is added, and the updated name list replaces the current membership of the distribution group.
