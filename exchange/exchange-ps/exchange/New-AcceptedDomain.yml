parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="SmtpDomainWithSubdomains" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The DomainName parameter specifies the SMTP domain that you want to establish as an accepted domain. Valid input for the DomainName parameter is an SMTP domain. You can use a wildcard character to specify all subdomains of a specified domain, as shown in the following example: \*.contoso.com.

    However, you can't embed a wildcard character, as shown in the following example: domain.\*.contoso.com. The domain name string may not contain more than 256 characters.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="AcceptedDomainType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainType
  description: |+
    The DomainType parameter specifies the type of accepted domain that you want to configure. Valid values are Authoritative, InternalRelay or ExternalRelay. You must set at least one value.

    In an authoritative domain, messages are delivered to a recipient that has a domain account in your Exchange organization. In an internal relay domain, messages are relayed to a server outside your Exchange organization, but still under the authority of your company or IT department. Use the internal relay domain if you want to treat the messages to this domain as internal messages. In an external relay domain, messages are relayed to an email server, outside your organization, which you don't control.

    The default value is Authoritative.
