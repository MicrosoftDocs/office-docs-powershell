# Start-MailboxSearch

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Start-MailboxSearch cmdlet to restart or resume a mailbox search that's been stopped.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Start-MailboxSearch [-Identity] <SearchObjectIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-Force]
 [-Resume] [-WhatIf] [-StatisticsStartIndex <Int32>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You can use In-Place eDiscovery to search one or more specified mailboxes or all mailboxes across the Exchange organization. A search is created by using the Exchange admin center (EAC) or the New-MailboxSearch cmdlet.

When restarting a search, any previous results returned by the same search and copied to a Discovery mailbox are removed. To preserve previous search results and resume the search from the point it was stopped, use the Resume switch.

In Exchange 2013 or later, mailbox searches are also used for In-Place Hold. However, you can't start or stop In-Place Hold using the Start-MailboxSearch and Stop-MailboxSearch cmdlets.

For more details, see [In-Place Hold and Litigation Hold in Exchange Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/holds/holds) and [In-Place eDiscovery in Exchange Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/ediscovery/ediscovery).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Start-MailboxSearch -Identity "ProjectContoso"
```

This example starts the mailbox search ProjectContoso.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the name of the search. The name is referenced when starting, stopping, or removing the search.

```yaml
Type: SearchObjectIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
The Force switch specifies whether to suppress warning or confirmation messages. You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Resume
The Resume switch resumes a stopped, failed, or partially succeeded search from the point it stopped. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

If you use this switch to resume a search, previous search results aren't removed from the target mailbox.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StatisticsStartIndex
The StatisticsStartIndex parameter is used by the EAC to retrieve keyword statistics in a paged operation.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
