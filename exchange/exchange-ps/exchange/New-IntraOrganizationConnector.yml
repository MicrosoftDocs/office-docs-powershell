### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the New-IntraOrganizationConnector cmdlet to create an Intra-Organization connector between two on-premises Exchange forests in an organization, between an Exchange on-premises organization and an Exchange Online organization, or between two Exchange Online organizations. This connector enables feature availability and service connectivity across the organizations using a common connector and connection endpoints.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

    This example creates an Intra-Organization connector named "MainCloudConnector" between an on-premises Exchange organization and an Exchange Online organization containing two domains, Cloud1.contoso.com and Cloud2.contoso.com.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.New-IntraOrganizationConnector
name: New-IntraOrganizationConnector
description: |-
  The New-IntraOrganizationConnector cmdlet is used to create a connection for features and services between divisions in your Exchange organization. It allows for the expansion of organizational boundaries for features and services across different hosts and network boundaries, such as between Active Directory forests, between on-premises and cloud-based organizations, or between tenants hosted in the same or different datacenters.

  For hybrid deployments between on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online organizations, the New-IntraOrganizationConnector cmdlet is used by the Hybrid Configuration wizard. Typically, the Intra-Organization connector is configured when the hybrid deployment is initially created by the wizard. We strongly recommend that you use the Hybrid Configuration wizard to create the Intra-Organization connector when configuring a hybrid deployment with an Exchange Online organization.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
