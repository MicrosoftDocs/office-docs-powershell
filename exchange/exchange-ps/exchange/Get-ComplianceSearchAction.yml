parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Case
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The Case parameter filters the results by the name of the specified case. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks.

  defaultValue: None

    The Details switch specifies whether to include detailed information in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is functional only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  name: Export
  description: |+
    The Export switch filters the results by Export compliance search actions. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can't use this switch with the Identity, Preview, or Purge parameters.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ComplianceSearchActionIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the compliance search action that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the compliance search action. For example:

    - Name: The compliance search action name uses the syntax `"Compliance Search Name_Action"`. For example, `"Case 1234_Preview"`.
    - JobRunId (GUID)

    You can't use this parameter with the Export, Preview, or Purge parameters.

    When you use the Identity parameter, more details are returned in the results. For example:

    - In the Results line, the values of the Item count, Total size, and Details properties are populated.
    - Location lines are added to the results.
    - The NumBindings property value is populated. This property includes the primary mailbox, the main archive, and any additional archives for users included in the search. NumBindings is not the number of users included in the search, because each included user could have or not have a combination of a primary mailbox, a main archive, and additional archives.
    - The affected location properties (for example, ExchangeLocation) are populated.
    - The CaseName property value is populated.

  After you create and run a compliance search using the New-ComplianceSearch cmdlet, and start the search using the Start-ComplianceSearch cmdlet, you assign a search action using the New-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet. You use the Get-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet to track the progress of the compliance search action.
