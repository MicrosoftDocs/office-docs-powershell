### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Disable-MetaCacheDatabase cmdlet to disable the metacache database on Exchange 2019 Mailbox servers. The metacache database stores mailbox database indexes and secondary copies of metadata on solid state drives (SSDs) to improve search latency and user logons.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    The Server parameter specifies the Mailbox server where you want to disable the metacache database. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Exchange Legacy DN

    You can specify multiple values separated by commas. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks ("). For example, "Server1","Server2"..."ServerN".

  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
