### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Get-MailboxImportRequest cmdlet to view the detailed status of an ongoing import request that was initiated using the New-MailboxImportRequest cmdlet.

  This cmdlet is available only in the Mailbox Import Export role, and by default, the role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use this cmdlet, you need to add the Mailbox Import Export role to a role group (for example, to the Organization Management role group). For more information, see [Add a role to a role group](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions/role-groups#add-a-role-to-a-role-group).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BatchName
  description: |+
    The BatchName parameter specifies the name given to a batch import request.

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Database
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

    The Database parameter specifies the database in which the user's mailbox or archive resides. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HighPriority
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The HighPriority parameter filters the results based on the Priority value that was assigned when the request was created. Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false. Here's how these values filter the results:

    - $true Returns requests that were created with the Priority value High, Higher, Highest or Emergency.
    - $false Returns requests that were created with the Priority value Normal, Low, Lower or Lowest.

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxImportRequestIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the identity of the import request. By default, import requests are named `<alias>\MailboxImportX` (where X = 0-9). If you specify a name for the import request, use the following syntax: `Alias\Name`. Microsoft Exchange automatically precedes the request with the mailbox's alias.

    You can't use this parameter with the following parameters:

    - BatchName
    - Mailbox
    - Name
    - Status
    - Suspend
    - HighPriority

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxOrMailUserIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Mailbox
  description: |+
    This parameter is functional only in on-premises Exchange.

    The Mailbox parameter filters the results by the destination mailbox where the content is being imported to.

    In Exchange 2016 CU7 or later, this parameter is the type MailboxLocationIdParameter, so the easiest value that you can use to identify the mailbox is the Alias value.

    In Exchange 2016 CU6 or earlier, this parameter is the type MailboxOrMailUserIdParameter, so you can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies that import requests that have the specified name are returned.

    Use this parameter to search on the name that you provided when you created the import request. If you didn't specify a name when the request was created, the default name is MailboxImportX (where X = 0-9).

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequestQueue
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The RequestQueue parameter identifies the request based on the mailbox database where the request is being run. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Unlimited" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ResultSize
  description: |+
    The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RequestStatus" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Status
  description: |+
    The Status parameter filters the results based on status. You can use the following values:

    - AutoSuspended
    - Completed
    - CompletedWithWarning
    - CompletionInProgress
    - Failed
    - InProgress
    - Queued
    - Retrying
    - Suspended
    - Synced

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

    CompletionInProgress and AutoSuspended don't apply to import requests and won't return any information.
