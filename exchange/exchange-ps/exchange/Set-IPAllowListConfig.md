# Set-IPAllowListConfig

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available or effective only on Edge Transport servers in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Set-IPAllowListConfig cmdlet to modify the IP Allow list configuration that's used by the Connection Filtering agent on Edge Transport servers.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-IPAllowListConfig [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-Enabled <Boolean>]
 [-ExternalMailEnabled <Boolean>] [-InternalMailEnabled <Boolean>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
On Edge Transport servers, the Connection Filtering agent acts on the IP address of the incoming SMTP connection to determine what action, if any, to take on an incoming message.

On Edge Transport servers, you need to be a member of the local Administrators group to run this cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-IPAllowListConfig -InternalMailEnabled $true
```

This example configures connection filtering to use the IP Allow list on messages that come from internal connections.

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Enabled
The Enabled parameter specifies whether the IP Allow list is used for content filtering. Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false. The default value is $true. By default, the IP Allow list is used for content filtering.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExternalMailEnabled
The ExternalMailEnabled parameter specifies whether messages from connections outside of the Exchange organization are evaluated by the IP Allow list. Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false. The default value is $true. By default, messages from external connections are evaluated by the IP Allow list.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InternalMailEnabled
The InternalMailEnabled parameter specifies whether messages from connections inside the Exchange organization are evaluated by the IP Allow list. Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false. The default value is $false. By default, messages from internal connections are not evaluated by the IP Allow list. Authenticated partner messages aren't considered internal mail.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
