## DESCRIPTION
After you create and run a compliance search using the New-ComplianceSearch cmdlet, and start the search using the Start-ComplianceSearch cmdlet, you assign a search action using the New-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet. You use the Get-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet to track the progress of the compliance search action.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

In on-premises Exchange, this cmdlet is available in the Mailbox Search role. By default, this role is assigned only to the Discovery Management role group.

To use this cmdlet in Security & Compliance PowerShell, you need to be assigned permissions. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-ComplianceSearchAction
```

This example shows a summary list of all compliance search actions.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-ComplianceSearchAction -Identity "Case 1234_Preview" | Format-List
```

This example shows details about the compliance search action named "Case 1234_Preview"

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the compliance search action that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the compliance search action. For example:

- Name: The compliance search action name uses the syntax `"Compliance Search Name_Action"`. For example, `"Case 1234_Preview"`.
- JobRunId (GUID)

You can't use this parameter with the Export, Preview, or Purge parameters.

When you use the Identity parameter, more details are returned in the results. For example:

- In the Results line, the values of the Item count, Total size, and Details properties are populated.
- Location lines are added to the results.
- The NumBindings property value is populated. This property includes the primary mailbox, the main archive, and any additional archives for users included in the search. NumBindings is not the number of users included in the search, because each included user could have or not have a combination of a primary mailbox, a main archive, and additional archives.
- The affected location properties (for example, ExchangeLocation) are populated.
- The CaseName property value is populated.
