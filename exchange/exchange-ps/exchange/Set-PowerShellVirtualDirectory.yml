parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BasicAuthentication
  description: |+
    The BasicAuthentication parameter specifies whether Basic authentication is enabled on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

    - $true: Basic authentication is enabled. This is the default value.
    - $false: Basic authentication is disabled.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateAuthentication
  description: |+
    The CertificateAuthentication parameter specifies whether certificate authentication is enabled on the Windows PowerShell virtual directory. The valid values are $true and $false. The default value is $false.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010

  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExtendedProtectionFlags
  description: |+
    The ExtendedProtectionFlags parameter specifies custom settings for Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

    - None: This is the default setting.
    - AllowDotlessSPN: Required if you want to use Service Principal Name (SPN) values that don't contain FQDNs (for example, HTTP/ContosoMail instead of HTTP/mail.contoso.com). You specify SPNs with the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter. This setting makes Extended Protection for Authentication less secure because dotless certificates aren't unique, so it isn't possible to ensure that the client-to-proxy connection was established over a secure channel.
    - NoServiceNameCheck: The SPN list isn't checked to validate a channel binding token. This setting makes Extended Protection for Authentication less secure. We generally don't recommend this setting.
    - Proxy: A proxy server is responsible for terminating the SSL channel. To use this setting, you need to register an SPN by using the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.
    - ProxyCoHosting: HTTP and HTTPS traffic may be accessing the virtual directory, and a proxy server is located between at least some of the clients and the Client Access services on the Exchange server.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExtendedProtectionSPNList
  description: |+
    The ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter specifies a list of valid Service Principal Names (SPNs) if you're using Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

    - $null: This is the default value.
    - Single SPN or comma delimited list of valid SPNs: The SPN value format is `Protocol\FQDN`. For example, HTTP/mail.contoso.com. To add an SPN that's not an FQDN (for example, HTTP/ContosoMail), you also need to use the AllowDotlessSPN value for the ExtendedProtectionFlags parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ExtendedProtectionTokenCheckingMode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExtendedProtectionTokenChecking
  description: |+
    The ExtendedProtectionTokenChecking parameter defines how you want to use Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Extended Protection for Authentication isn't enabled by default. Valid values are:

    - None: Extended Protection for Authentication isn't be used on the virtual directory. This is the default value.
    - Allow: Extended Protection for Authentication is used for connections between clients and the virtual directory if both the client and server support it. Connections that don't support Extended Protection for Authentication will work, but may not be as secure as connections that use Extended Protection for Authentication.
    - Require: Extended Protection for Authentication is used for all connections between clients and the virtual directory. If either the client or server doesn't support it, the connection will fail. If you use this value, you also need to set an SPN value for the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.

    **Note**: If you use the value Allow or Require, and you have a proxy server between the client and the Client Access services on the Mailbox server that's configured to terminate the client-to-proxy SSL channel, you also need to configure one or more Service Principal Names (SPNs) by using the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Uri" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExternalUrl
  description: |+
    The ExternalURL parameter specifies the URL that's used to connect to the virtual directory from outside the firewall.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="VirtualDirectoryIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the PowerShell virtual directory that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the virtual directory. For example:

    - Name or Server\\Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    The Name value uses the syntax `"VirtualDirectoryName (WebsiteName)"` from the properties of the virtual directory. You can specify the wildcard character (\*) instead of the default website by using the syntax `VirtualDirectoryName*`.

  name: RequireSSL
  description: |+
    The RequireSSL parameter specifies whether the Windows PowerShell virtual directory should require that the client connection be made using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The valid values are $true and $false. The default value is $true.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""

  name: WhatIf
