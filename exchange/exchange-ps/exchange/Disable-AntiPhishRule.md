# Disable-AntiPhishRule

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Disable-AntiPhishRule cmdlet to disable antiphish rules in your cloud-based organization.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Disable-AntiPhishRule [-Identity] <RuleIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Disable-AntiPhishRule -Identity "Engineering Department Phishing Rule"
```

This example disables the antiphish rule named Engineering Department Phishing Rule.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the antiphish rule that you want to disable. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the rule. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

```yaml
Type: RuleIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

This cmdlet has a built-in pause, so use `-Confirm:$false` to skip the confirmation.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
