### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  The New-SiteMailbox cmdlet is used by the Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft Exchange user interfaces to create site mailboxes. We recommend that you don't use this cmdlet; instead use SharePoint to create the site mailbox. This cmdlet should only be used for diagnostic and troubleshooting purposes.

  Site mailboxes were deprecated in Exchange Online and SharePoint Online in 2017. For more information, see [Deprecation of Site Mailboxes](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/deprecation-of-site-mailboxes/ba-p/93028).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Alias
  description: |+
    The Alias parameter specifies the alias of the site mailbox.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
