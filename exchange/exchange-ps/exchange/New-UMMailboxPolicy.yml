  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

name: New-UMMailboxPolicy
description: |-
  The New-UMMailboxPolicy cmdlet creates a UM mailbox policy that has organization-wide scope. UM mailbox policies provide a set of policy values to be applied to UM-enabled users associated with a particular UM dial plan. UM mailbox policies are directly associated with UM dial plans. Therefore, the settings contained within a UM mailbox policy apply only to UM-enabled users of the UM dial plan that the UM mailbox policy is associated with. You can also use the New-UMMailboxPolicy cmdlet to create a UM mailbox policy template that can be used to create additional UM mailbox policies.

  After this task is completed, a new UM mailbox policy is created.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
