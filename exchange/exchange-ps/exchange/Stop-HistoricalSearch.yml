  A historical search provides message trace and report details in a comma-separated value (CSV) file for messages that are less than 90 days old.

  After you start a historical search by using the Start-HistoricalSearch cmdlet, the search is queued, but not actually running. While the search is queued and has the status value of NotStarted, you can use the Stop-HistoricalSearch cmdlet to stop it. After the search is actively running, and has a status value of InProgress, you can't stop it. When you stop a historical search, it's given a status value of Cancelled.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet.

To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
