  When the cmdlet is used for a single Exchange server, it returns the Unified Messaging service properties, including MaxCalls, MaxFaxCalls and UMDialPlans. The properties and their values for the Exchange server are stored in the Unified Messaging section of the Exchange Server configuration object in Active Directory.

  The ExchangeVersion attribute that's returned is the minimum version of Exchange you can use to manage the returned object. This attribute isn't the same as the version of Exchange that's displayed in the Exchange admin center when you select Server Configuration.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
