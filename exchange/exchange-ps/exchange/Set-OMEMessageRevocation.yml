    The MessageId parameter specifies the message based on the value the Message-ID header field. This value is also known as the Client ID. The format of the Message-ID depends on the messaging server that sent the message. The value should be unique for each message. However, not all messaging servers create values for the Message-ID in the same way. Be sure to include the full Message ID string (which may include angle brackets) and enclose the value in quotation marks (for example, "<d9683b4c-127b-413a-ae2e-fa7dfb32c69d@DM3NAM06BG401.Eop-nam06.prod.protection.outlook.com>").

    You can find the Message ID for a message in Message Trace or the Message Encryption Report in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

  When an email has been revoked, the recipient will get the following error when they try to view the encrypted message in the OME portal: "The message has been revoked by the sender".

  You can revoke encrypted messages if the recipient received a link-based, branded encrypted email message. If the recipient received a native inline experience in a supported Outlook client, then you can't revoke encryption for the message.
