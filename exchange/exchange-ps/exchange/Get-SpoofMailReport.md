# Get-SpoofMailReport

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Get-SpoofMailReport cmdlet to view information about spoofed senders in your cloud-based organization for the past 90 days. Spoofing is where the sender of the inbound message is different than the actual source of the message (for example, the sender is lila@contoso.com, but the message was sent from the email infrastructure of fabrikam.com).

**Note**: We recommend that you use the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. For instructions, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-SpoofMailReport cmdlet returns the following information:

- Date: Date the message was sent.
- Event Type: Typically, this value is SpoofMail.
- Direction: This value is Inbound.
- Domain: The sender domain. This corresponds to one of your organization's accepted domains.
- Spoofed User: The sending email address if the domain is one of your organization's domains, or the sending domain if the domain is external.
- True Sender: The organizational domain of the PTR record, or pointer record, of the sending IP address, also known as the reverse DNS address. If the sending IP address does not have a PTR record, this field will be blank and the Sender IP column will be filled in. Both columns will not be filled in at the same time.
- Sending Infrastructure: The true sending domain that's found in the DNS record of the source email server. If no domain is found, the source email server's IP address is shown.
- Count: The number of spoofed messages that were sent to your organization from the source messaging server during the specified time period.
- Spoof Type: The relationship between the sender and recipient domain of the spoof mail. If both belong to same domain (including subdomains) or domain owned by the same organization, then Spoof Type is intra-org or Internal. If both belong to different domains, then Spoof Type is cross-org or External.
- Source: Typically, this value is "Spoof intelligence".
- Result: CompAuthResult
- Result Code: CompAuthReason
- SPF
- DKIM
- DMARC
