parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comments
  description: |+
    The Comments parameter specifies informative comments for the rule, such as what the rule is used for or how it has changed over time. The length of the comment can't exceed 1024 characters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Priority
  description: |+
    The Priority parameter specifies a priority value for the rule that determines the order of rule processing. A lower integer value indicates a higher priority, the value 0 is the highest priority, and rules can't have the same priority value.

    Valid values and the default value for this parameter depend on the number of existing rules. For example, if there are 8 existing rules:

    - Valid priority values for the existing 8 rules are from 0 through 7.
    - Valid priority values for a new rule (the 9th rule) are from 0 through 8.
    - The default value for a new rule (the 9th rule) is 8.

    If you modify the priority value of a rule, the position of the rule in the list changes to match the priority value you specify. In other words, if you set the priority value of a rule to the same value as an existing rule, the priority value of the existing rule and all other lower priority rules after it is increased by 1.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
