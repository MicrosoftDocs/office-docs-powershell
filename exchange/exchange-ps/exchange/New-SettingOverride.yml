### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  **Caution**: Incorrect usage of the setting override cmdlets can cause serious damage to your Exchange organization. This damage could require you to reinstall Exchange. Only use these cmdlets as instructed by product documentation or under the direction of Microsoft Customer Service and Support.

  Use the New-SettingOverride cmdlet to create setting overrides that store Exchange customizations in Active Directory instead of in text files on the server.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    New-SettingOverride -Name "IM Override" -Component OwaServer -Section IMSettings -Parameters @("IMServerName=skype01.contoso.com","IMCertificateThumbprint=CDF34A740E9D225A1A06193A9D44B2CE22775308") -Reason "Configure IM"
  description: |-
    This example creates a new setting override named IM Server Integration. This override specifies the Skype for Business Server 2015 pool and a certificate thumbprint that allows instant messaging (IM) integration between Outlook on the web and Skype for Business. Because the Server parameter isn't used, the override applies to all Exchange 2016 servers in the Active Directory forest.

    For more information, see the topic Configure instant messaging integration with Outlook on the web in Exchange 2016.

- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    New-SettingOverride -Name "Change OAB Generation" -Server Mailbox01 -Component TimeBasedAssistants -Section OABGeneratorAssistant -Parameters @("WorkCycle=02:00:00") -Reason "Generate OAB Every 2 hours"
  description: |-
    This example creates a new setting override named Change OAB Generation. This override specifies a 2 hour OAB generation interval. Because the Server parameter is used, the override applies only to the specified server named Mailbox01.

    For more information, see the topic [Change the offline address book generation schedule in Exchange](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/plan-and-deploy/post-installation-tasks/change-oab-generation-schedule).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Component
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Component parameter specifies the component that the setting override is applied to. For example:

    - TimeBasedAssistants
    - OwaServer

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Version" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaxVersion
  description: |+
    The MaxVersion parameter specifies the latest version of Exchange 2016 that this override applies to (up to and including the specified value).

    Valid input for this parameter is an Exchange 2016 version value in the format 15.1.xxx.xx. You can use values with leading zeros, but the leading zeros are removed from the results. For example, 15.01.0225.042 is stored as 15.1.225.42.

    The default value is blank ($null), which means the override applies to all versions of Exchange 2016.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Version" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MinVersion
  description: |+
    The MinVersion parameter specifies the earliest version of Exchange 2016 that this override applies to (up to and including the specified value).

    Valid input for this parameter is an Exchange 2016 version value in the format 15.1.xxx.xx. You can use values with leading zeros, but the leading zeros are removed from the results. For example, 15.01.0225.042 is stored as 15.1.225.42.

    The default value is blank ($null), which means the override applies to all versions of Exchange 2016.

  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name

  name: Parameters
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Parameters parameter specifies one or more parameters for the override that are available for the combination of the Component and Section parameter values. This parameter uses the syntax: `@("Parameter1=Value1","Parameter2=Value2"...)`. For example:

    - `@("Enabled=true")`
    - `@("IMServerName=<SkypePoolFQDN>","IMCertificateThumbprint=<ThumbprintGUID>")`

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Section
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Section parameter specifies the name of the section for which the override is created. The available values for this parameter depend on the value of the Component parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Server
  description: |+
    The Server parameter specifies the name of the Exchange 2016 server where you want the override applied. You can specify a single Exchange 2016 server name, or an array of Exchange 2016 server name wildcards. For example, if you have three Exchange 2016 servers named Exchange01, Exchange02 and Exchange03, specify the value Exchange\* to apply the override to all of them.

    If you don't use this parameter to specify a server, the override applies to all Exchange 2016 servers in the Active Directory forest.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013

description: |-
  Setting overrides configure and store Exchange server customizations in Active Directory. The settings can be organization-wide or server-specific, and they persist in Active Directory across Exchange Cumulative Updates (CUs). Exchange customizations in web.config or exe.config XML application configuration files are server-specific, and are lost when you install the next Exchange CU.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
