# Import-TransportRuleCollection

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Import-TransportRuleCollection cmdlet to import a transport rule collection. You can import a rule collection you previously exported as a backup, or import rules that you've exported from an older version of Exchange.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Import-TransportRuleCollection [-FileData] <Byte[]>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Force]
 [[-Identity] <RuleIdParameter>]
 [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Importing a transport rule collection from an XML file removes or overwrites all pre-existing transport rules that were defined in your organization. Make sure that you have a backup of your current transport rule collection before you import and overwrite your current transport rules.

Importing file data is a two-step process. First you must load the data to a variable using the Get-Content cmdlet, and then use that variable to transmit the data to the cmdlet.

For information about how to export a transport rule collection to an XML file, see [Export-TransportRuleCollection](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/export-transportrulecollection).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
[Byte[]]$Data = Get-Content -Path "C:\TransportRules\ExportedRules.xml" -Encoding Byte -ReadCount 0; Import-TransportRuleCollection -FileData $Data
```

This example imports a transport rule collection from the XML file named ExportedRules.xml in the  C:\\TransportRules folder.

**Note**: In PowerShell 6.0 or later, replace `-Encoding Byte` with `-AsByteStream`.

## PARAMETERS

### -FileData
The FileData parameter specifies the variable name that contains the content of the XML file. The content is retrieved using the Get-Content cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: Byte[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
The Force switch specifies that the command will override any errors or warnings encountered during the import operation. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange, and is only functional in Exchange Server 2010.

The Identity parameter specifies the transport rule to be imported. Use either the GUID or the name of the rule. You can omit the parameter label.

```yaml
Type: RuleIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
