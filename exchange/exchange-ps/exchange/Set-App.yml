  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

All users are blocked from installing their own instances of this app, including but not limited to users with install apps permissions.
    - SpecificUsers: This app is provided to only the users specified by the UserList parameter. All other users don't see this organizational app in their management view, nor will it activate in their mail or calendar items. The specified users are also blocked from installing their own instance of this app. Unlisted users aren't blocked from installing their own instance of this app.

    You use this parameter with the OrganizationApp switch.

  name: UserList
  description: |+
    The UserList parameter specifies who can use an organizational app. This parameter is limited to 1000 users. In the cloud-based service, this value is less relevant as Office Add-in management is moving to [Centralized Deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/publish/centralized-deployment).

    Valid values are mailboxes or mail users in your organization. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the user. For example:

    - Name

    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`. Maximum size of the list is 1000 recipients.

    You use this parameter with the OrganizationApp switch.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Set-App
name: Set-App
description: |-
  The Set-App cmdlet can only be used when configuring the availability of an organization app. This task requires that the specified app has already been installed (for example, that the app has been installed with the New-App cmdlet, or that it's a default app for Outlook).

  Default apps in Outlook on the web and apps that you've installed for use by users in your organization are known as organization apps. Organization apps can't be removed by end users, but can be enabled or disabled. If an app is an organization app (scope default or organization), the delete control on the toolbar is disabled for end users. Administrators are able to remove organization apps. Administrators can't remove default apps, but they can disable them for the entire organization.

  For more information, see [Manage user access to add-ins for Outlook in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/manage-user-access-to-add-ins-exchange-2013-help) and [Manage deployment of add-ins in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/office365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
