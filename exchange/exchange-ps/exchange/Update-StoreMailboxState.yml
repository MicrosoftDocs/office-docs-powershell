### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Update-StoreMailboxState cmdlet to synchronize the mailbox state for a mailbox in the Exchange mailbox store with the state of the corresponding Active Directory user account.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).
module: ExchangePowerShell
notes: |-
  If a mailbox is moved to another database, the mailbox is immediately disabled. There's a 24-hour delay to allow for replication.

  In this scenario, Update-StoreMailboxState might not immediately update the DisconnectState and DisconnectReason properties in the output of Get-MailboxStatistics. The values will update approximately 24 hours after the move.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox that you want to update. Use the mailbox GUID as the value for this parameter.

    Run the following command to obtain the mailbox GUID and other information for all mailboxes in your organization: Get-MailboxDatabase | Get-MailboxStatistics | Format-List DisplayName,MailboxGuid,Database,DisconnectReason,DisconnectDate.

description: |-
  The Update-StoreMailboxState cmdlet forces the mailbox store state in the Exchange store to be synchronized with Active Directory. In some cases, it's possible that the store state for a mailbox to become out-of-sync with the state of the corresponding Active Directory user account. This can result from Active Directory replication latency. For example, if a mailbox-enabled user account is disabled in Active Directory but isn't marked as disabled in the Exchange mailbox store. In this case, running the Update-StoreMailboxState will synchronize the mailbox store state with the state of the Active Directory user account and mark the mailbox as disabled in the mailbox store. You can use this command to troubleshoot issues that may be a result when the store state for a mailbox is unexpected or if you suspect that the store state is different than the state for the corresponding Active Directory account.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you.
