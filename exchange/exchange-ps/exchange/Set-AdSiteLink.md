# Set-AdSiteLink

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Set-AdSiteLink cmdlet to assign an Exchange-specific cost to an Active Directory IP site link. You can also use this cmdlet to configure the maximum message size that can pass across an Active Directory IP site link.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-AdSiteLink [-Identity] <AdSiteLinkIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-ExchangeCost <Int32>] [-MaxMessageSize <Unlimited>] [-Name <String>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
By default, Microsoft Exchange determines the least cost routing path by using the cost assigned to the Active Directory IP site link. You can use the Set-AdSiteLink cmdlet to assign an Exchange-specific cost to the Active Directory IP site link. The Exchange-specific cost is a separate attribute used instead of the Active Directory-assigned cost to determine the least cost routing path.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-AdSiteLink DEFAULT_IP_SITE_LINK -ExchangeCost 25 -MaxMessageSize 10MB
```

This example assigns an Exchange-specific cost of 25 to the IP site link DEFAULT\_IP\_SITE\_LINK and configures a maximum message size limit of 10 MB on the IP site link.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the name or GUID of the IP site link you want to modify.

```yaml
Type: AdSiteLinkIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExchangeCost
The ExchangeCost parameter specifies an Exchange-specific cost for the IP site link. This cost is used instead of the Active Directory-assigned cost. To clear the value of the ExchangeCost parameter and revert to using the cost of the IP site link specified in Active Directory, set the value of the ExchangeCost parameter to $null.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MaxMessageSize
The MaxMessageSize parameter specifies the maximum size of a message that can pass across the Active Directory IP site link. The default value is unlimited.

When you enter a value, qualify the value with one of the following units:

- B (bytes)

- KB (kilobytes)

- MB (megabytes)

- GB (gigabytes)

- TB (terabytes)

Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte.

The valid input range for this parameter is from 64 KB through Int64. To remove the message size limit on an Active Directory IP site link, enter a value of unlimited.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the IP site link. The name that you assign overwrites the current identity of the IP site link.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
