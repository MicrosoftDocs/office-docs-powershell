### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the New-MailboxSearch cmdlet to create a mailbox search and either get an estimate of search results, place search results on In-Place Hold or copy them to a Discovery mailbox. You can also place all contents in a mailbox on hold by not specifying a search query, which accomplishes similar results as Litigation Hold.

  **Note**: As of October 2020, the \*-MailboxSearch cmdlets are retired in Exchange Online PowerShell. Use the \*-ComplianceSearch cmdlets in Security & Compliance PowerShell instead. For more information, see [Retirement of legacy eDiscovery tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/ediscovery-legacy-retirement).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    New-MailboxSearch -Name "Legal-ProjectX" -SourceMailboxes DG-Marketing,DG-Executives -TargetMailbox LegalDiscovery@contoso.com -StartDate "01/01/2018" -EndDate "12/31/2018" -Recipients "@contoso.com" -SearchQuery "project report hasattachments:true" -StatusMailRecipients "DG-DiscoveryTeam"
  description: |-
    This example creates the mailbox search Legal-ProjectX. The search uses several parameters to restrict the search query:

    - SourceMailboxes: This parameter restricts the search to members of the DG-Marketing and DG-Executives distribution groups.
    - Recipients: This parameter specifies that the search includes all mail sent to the domain contoso.com.
    - SearchQuery: This parameter specifies a KQL query for messages with either the words project or report and for messages with attachments.
    - StartDate and EndDate: These parameters specify the start date of January 1, 2018, and end date of December 31, 2018, for the search.
    - TargetMailbox: This parameter specifies that search results should be copied to the discovery mailbox LegalDiscovery.
    - StatusMailRecipients: This parameter specifies that the distribution group DG-DiscoveryTeam is to receive a notification when the search is complete.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    New-MailboxSearch -Name "Hold-ProjectX" -SourceMailboxes DG-Finance -InPlaceHoldEnabled $true
  description: |-
    This example creates an In-Place Hold named Hold-ProjectX and places all members of the distribution group DG-Finance on hold. Because the search doesn't specify the SearchQuery and ItemHoldPeriod parameters, all messages in mailboxes returned are placed on indefinite In-Place Hold.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    New-MailboxSearch -Name "Hold-tailspintoys" -SourceMailboxes DG-Research -SearchQuery '"Patent" AND "Project tailspintoys"' -InPlaceHoldEnabled $true
  description: |-
    This example creates an In-Place Hold named Hold-tailspintoys and places all members of the distribution group DG-Research on hold. Because the search specifies the SearchQuery parameter, only messages that match the search query are placed on indefinite In-Place Hold.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 4
  code: |-
    New-MailboxSearch -Name "Hold for all PFs" -AllPublicFolderSources $true -InPlaceHoldEnabled $true
  description: |-
    In on-premises Exchange, this example creates an In-Place Hold named Hold for all PFs that places all content in all public folders on In-Place hold, with an unlimited hold duration.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllPublicFolderSources
  description: |+
    The AllPublicFolderSources parameter specifies whether to include all public folders in the organization in the search. Valid values are:

    - $true: All public folders are included in the search. This value is required when the value of the AllSourceMailboxes parameter is $false and you don't specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value is blank [$null]).
    - $false: No public folders are included in the search. This is the default value. You can use this value when the value of the AllSourceMailboxes parameter is $true or you specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value isn't blank [$null]).

  name: AllSourceMailboxes
  description: |+
    The AllSourceMailboxes parameter specifies whether to include all mailboxes in the search. Valid values are:

    - $true: All mailboxes are included in the search. This value is required when the value of the AllPublicFolderSources parameter is $false and you don't specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value is blank [$null]).
    - $false: All mailboxes aren't included in the search. This is the default value. You can use this value when the value of the AllPublicFolderSources parameter is $true or you specify one or more source mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter (the parameter value isn't blank [$null]).

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    The default value is blank ($null), which means no source mailboxes are specified. To clear the source mailboxes, use the value $null.

    To enable In-Place Hold on the search results, you need to set the AllSourceMailboxes parameter to $false (the default value) and configure one or both of the following settings:

name: New-MailboxSearch
description: |-
  The New-MailboxSearch cmdlet creates an In-Place eDiscovery search or an In-Place Hold. You can stop, start, modify, or remove the search.

  By default, mailbox searches are performed across all Exchange 2013 or later Mailbox servers in an organization, unless you constrain the search to fewer mailboxes by using the SourceMailboxes parameter. To search mailboxes on Exchange 2010 Mailbox servers, run the command on an Exchange 2010 server.

  For more information, see [In-Place eDiscovery in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/ediscovery/ediscovery) and [In-Place Hold and Litigation Hold in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/holds/holds).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
