parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox repair request to remove. Mailbox repair requests are identified by a complex GUID that is created when a new mailbox repair request is created. This GUID consists of a database ID, a Request ID and a job ID. The format is `DatabaseGuid\RequestGuid\JobGuid`. Use the Get-MailboxRepairRequest cmdlet to find the identity of a mailbox repair request.

  name: WhatIf

    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

description: |-
  You can run the Remove-MailboxRepairRequest cmdlet to remove all mailbox repair requests for a specific database, for a group of related mailbox repair requests, or for a specific mailbox repair request. Mailbox repair requests are identified by a complex GUID with the following format: `DatabaseGuid\RequestGuid\JobGuid`. The DatabaseGuid identifies the mailbox database where the mailbox being repaired is located. The RequestGuid identifies related requests that may contain more than one job if the request runs more than one task or targets more than one mailbox. The JobGuid identifies a unique job. See the examples to remove all requests on a mailbox database, remove a group of related requests that share the same RequestGuid, or remove a specific request by specifying the complete `DatabaseGuid\RequestGuid\JobGuid` value.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
