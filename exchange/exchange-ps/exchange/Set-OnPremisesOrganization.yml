parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comment
  description: |+
    The Comment parameter specifies an optional comment. If you specify a value that contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example: "This is an admin note".

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

description: |-
  The OnPremisesOrganization object represents an on-premises Exchange organization configured for hybrid deployment with a Microsoft 365 organization. Typically, this object is only modified and updated by the Hybrid Configuration wizard. Manual modification of this object may result in hybrid deployment misconfiguration; therefore, we strongly recommend that you use the Hybrid Configuration wizard to update this object in the Microsoft 365 organization.
