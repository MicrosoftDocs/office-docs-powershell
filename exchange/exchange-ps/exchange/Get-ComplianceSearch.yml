parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Case
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The Case parameter filters the results by the name of a eDiscovery Standard case that the compliance search is associated with. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks.

    You can't use this parameter to view compliance searches associated with eDiscovery Premium cases.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ComplianceSearchIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the compliance search that you want to view.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the compliance search. For example:

    - Name
    - JobRunId (GUID)

    You can find these values by running the command Get-ComplianceSearch | Format-Table -Auto Name,JobRunId,Status

    To improve the performance of this cmdlet, some compliance search properties aren't returned if you don't specify the identity of the compliance search. These properties are:

    - Items
    - Size
    - SuccessResults
    - NumBindings
    - ExchangeLocation
    - SharePointLocation
    - OneDriveLocation

    To view these properties, you need to use the Identity parameter in the command.

    **Note**: The NumBindings property includes the primary mailbox, the main archive, and any additional archives for users included in the search. NumBindings is not the number of users included in the search, because each included user could have or not have a combination of a primary mailbox, a main archive, and additional archives.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2016

  name: ResultSize
  description: |+
    The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.
