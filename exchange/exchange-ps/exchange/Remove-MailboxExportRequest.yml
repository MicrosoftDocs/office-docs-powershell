### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Remove-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet to remove fully or partially completed export requests. You can create multiple export requests for a specified mailbox provided that you specify a distinct name. Completed export requests aren't cleared automatically; they need to be removed by using this cmdlet.

  This cmdlet is available only in the Mailbox Import Export role, and by default, the role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use this cmdlet, you need to add the Mailbox Import Export role to a role group (for example, to the Organization Management role group). For more information, see [Add a role to a role group](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions/role-groups#add-a-role-to-a-role-group).

  When a partially completed export request is removed, content already exported isn't removed from the PST file. If you want to start a new export request to the same file name and start with an empty PST file, you need to rename or delete the previous PST file.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxExportRequestIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the identity of the export request. By default, export requests are named `<alias>\MailboxExportX` (where X = 0-9). Use the following syntax: `Alias\Name`.

    You can't use this parameter with the RequestGuid parameter.

- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequestGuid
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The RequestGuid parameter specifies the unique identifier for the export request. To find the export request GUID, use the Get-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet. If you specify the RequestGuid parameter, you must also specify the RequestQueue parameter. You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

- type: <xref href="DatabaseIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequestQueue
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The RequestQueue parameter identifies the request based on the mailbox database where the request is being run. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

  defaultValue: None
