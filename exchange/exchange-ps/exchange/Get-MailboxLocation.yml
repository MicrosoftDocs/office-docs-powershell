  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Database
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The Database parameter returns the mailbox location information for all mailboxes on the specified mailbox database. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

- type: <xref href="MailboxLocationIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox location object that you want to view. The value uses the either of the following formats:

    - TenantGUID\\MailboxGUID
    - MailboxGUID

    In Exchange Server or Exchange Online, you can run the following command to find and compare the MailboxGUID values for the user: `Get-Mailbox -Identity <MailboxIdentity> | Format-List *GUID,MailboxLocations`.

    In Exchange Online, you can find the TenantGUID and MailboxGUID values after you run Get-MailboxLocation with the User parameter.

    You can't use this parameter with the User parameter.
