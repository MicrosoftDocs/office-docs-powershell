parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  The Remove-UMCallAnsweringRule cmdlet removes an existing UM call answering rule that has been created and stored in a UM-enabled user's mailbox. When you remove an existing call answering rule, all of the remaining call answering rules are still processed in order of their priority.

  After this task is completed, the cmdlet sets the parameters and the values specified.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet.
