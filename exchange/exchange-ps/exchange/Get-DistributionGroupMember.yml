parameters:
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DistributionGroupMemberIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the distribution group or mail-enabled security group. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnoreDefaultScope
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange PowerShell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch enables the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope, but also introduces the following restrictions:

    - You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.
    - You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeSoftDeletedObjects
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The IncludeSoftDeletedGroups switch specifies whether to include soft-deleted group members in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    Soft-deleted group members are deleted Microsoft 365 Groups or mailboxes that are still recoverable.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReadFromDomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The ReadFromDomainController switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    The command: `Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true` to include all objects in the forest requires the ReadFromDomainController switch. Otherwise, the command might use a global catalog that contains outdated information. Also, you might need to run multiple iterations of the command with the ReadFromDomainController switch to get the information.

    By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Unlimited" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ResultSize
  description: |+
    The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Get-DistributionGroupMember
name: Get-DistributionGroupMember
description: |-
  If your organization has multiple Active Directory domains, you may need to run the Set-ADServerSettings cmdlet with the ViewEntireForest parameter set to $true before running the Get-DistributionGroupMember cmdlet to view the entire forest. For more information, see Example 2.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
