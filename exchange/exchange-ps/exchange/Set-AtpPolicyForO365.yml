  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowSafeDocsOpen
  description: |+
    The AllowSafeDocsOpen parameter specifies whether users can click through and bypass the Protected View container even when Safe Documents identifies a file as malicious. Valid values are:

    - $true: Users are allowed to exit the Protected View container even if the document has been identified as malicious.
    - $false: Users aren't allowed to exit Protected View in case of a malicious detection.

    This parameter is meaningful only when the EnableSafeDocs parameter value is $true.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    The EnableATPForSPOTeamsODB parameter enables or disables Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams. Valid values are:

    - $true: Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams is enabled. SharePoint Online admins can use the DisallowInfectedFileDownload parameter on the [Set-SPOTenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/Set-SPOTenant) cmdlet to control whether users are allowed to download files that are found to be malicious.
    - $false: Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams is disabled. This is the default value.

  name: EnableSafeDocs
  description: |+
