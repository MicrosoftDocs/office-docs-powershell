## DESCRIPTION
When you modify a role assignment, you can specify a new predefined or custom management scope or provide an organizational unit (OU) to scope the existing role assignment.

You can create custom management scopes using the New-ManagementScope cmdlet and can view a list of existing scopes using the Get-ManagementScope cmdlet. If you choose not to specify an OU, predefined scope, or custom scope, the implicit write scope of the role applies to the role assignment.

For more information about management role assignments, see [Understanding management role assignments](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/understanding-management-role-assignments-exchange-2013-help).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-ManagementRoleAssignment "Mail Recipients_Denver Help Desk" -Enabled $false
```

This example disables the Mail Recipients\_Denver Help Desk role assignment. When a role assignment is disabled, the users assigned the role can no longer run cmdlets granted by the role.

### Example 2
```powershell
Set-ManagementRoleAssignment "MyGAL_KimA" -RecipientRelativeWriteScope MyGAL
```

This example changes the recipient scope for the MyGAL\_KimA role assignment to MyGAL. When the recipient scope is changed to a predefined value, any previously defined OUs or custom scopes are overwritten.

### Example 3
```powershell
Set-ManagementRoleAssignment "Mail Recipients_Marketing Admins" -RecipientOrganizationalUnitScope "contoso.com/North America/Marketing/Users"
```

This example restricts the Mail Recipients\_Marketing Admins role assignment to the contoso.com/North America/Marketing/Users OU. Users who are members of the Marketing Admins role group assigned the role assignment can create, modify, and remove objects only in the specified OU. When the RecipientOrganizationalUnitScope parameter is used, any predefined or custom scopes on the role assignment are overwritten.

### Example 4
```powershell
Set-ManagementRoleAssignment "Distribution Groups_Cairns Admins" -CustomRecipientWriteScope "Cairns Recipients"
```

This example restricts the Distribution Groups\_Cairns Admins role assignment using the Cairns Recipients custom recipient management scope. Users that are members of the Cairns Admins role group assigned the role assignment can create, modify, and remove only the distribution group objects that match the Cairns Recipients custom recipient management scope.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the name of the management role assignment to modify. If the name of the management role contains spaces, enclose it in quotation marks (").

```yaml
Type: RoleAssignmentIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml

If you use the CustomRecipientWriteScope parameter, you can't use the RecipientOrganizationalUnitScope, RecipientRelativeWriteScope, or ExclusiveRecipientWriteScope parameters, and any configured OU or predefined scope on the role assignment is overwritten.

To remove a scope, specify a value of $null.

```yaml
Type: ManagementScopeIdParameter
Parameter Sets: CustomRecipientWriteScope
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

```

### -ExclusiveConfigWriteScope
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The ExclusiveConfigWriteScope parameter specifies the existing configuration exclusive management scope to associate with this management role assignment. If the management scope name contains spaces, enclose it in quotation marks (").

If you use the ExclusiveConfigWriteScope parameter, you can't use the CustomConfigWriteScope parameter.

To remove a scope, specify a value of $null.

```yaml
Type: ManagementScopeIdParameter
Parameter Sets: ExclusiveScope
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False

Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RecipientAdministrativeUnitScope
This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

The RecipientAdministrativeUnitScope parameter specifies the administrative unit to scope the role assignment to.

Administrative units are Azure Active Directory containers of resources. You can view the available administrative units by using the Get-AdministrativeUnit cmdlet.

You can't use this parameter with any of the other scope parameters.

```yaml
Type: AdministrativeUnitIdParameter
Parameter Sets: RecipientAdministrativeUnitScope
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None

```

### -RecipientOrganizationalUnitScope
The RecipientOrganizationalUnitScope parameter specifies the OU to scope the new role assignment to. If the OU name contains spaces, enclose the domain and OU in quotation marks (").

If you use the RecipientOrganizationalUnitScope parameter, you can't use the CustomRecipientWriteScope, ExclusiveRecipientWriteScope, or RecipientRelativeWriteScope parameters and any predefined scopes or custom scopes on the role assignment are overwritten.

To specify an OU, use the syntax: domain/ou. To remove an OU, specify a value of $null.

```yaml
Type: OrganizationalUnitIdParameter

If you use the RecipientRelativeWriteScope parameter, you can't use the CustomRecipientWriteScope, ExclusiveRecipientWriteScope, or RecipientOrganizationalUnitScope parameters.

The available types are: None, Organization, MyGAL, Self and MyDistributionGroups. If you specify a predefined scope, any custom scope or configured OU on the role assignment is overwritten.

Even though the NotApplicable, OU, MyDirectReports, CustomRecipientScope, MyExecutive, MailboxICanDelegate, and ExclusiveRecipientScope values appear in the syntax block for this parameter, they can't be used directly on the command line. They're used internally by the cmdlet.

```yaml
