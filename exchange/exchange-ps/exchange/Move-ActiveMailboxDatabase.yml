examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase DB2 -ActivateOnServer MBX1 -MountDialOverride:None
  description: |-
    This example performs a switchover of the database DB2 to the Mailbox server MBX1. When the command completes, MBX1 hosts the active copy of DB2. Because the MountDialOverride parameter is set to None, MBX1 mounts the database using its own defined database auto mount dial settings.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase DB1 -ActivateOnServer MBX3 -MountDialOverride:GoodAvailability
  description: |-
    This example performs a switchover of the database DB1 to the Mailbox server MBX3. When the command completes, MBX3 hosts the active copy of DB1. Because the MountDialOverride parameter is specified with a value of Good Availability, MBX3 mounts the database using a database auto mount dial setting of GoodAvailability.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase DB3 -ActivateOnServer MBX4
  description: |-
    This example performs a switchover of the database DB3 to the Mailbox server MBX4. When the command completes, MBX4 hosts the active copy of DB3. Because the MountDialOverride parameter isn't specified, MBX4 mounts the database using a database auto mount dial setting of Lossless.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 4
  code: |-
    Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase -Server MBX1
  description: |-
    This example performs a server switchover for the Mailbox server MBX1. All active mailbox database copies on MBX1 will be activated on one or more other Mailbox servers with healthy copies of the active databases on MBX1.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="MailboxServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ActivateOnServer
  description: |+
    The ActivateOnServer parameter specifies the name of the Mailbox server on which the mailbox database copy should be activated.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ActivatePreferredOnServer
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The ActivatePreferredOnServer parameter specifies the Mailbox server where you want to activate all mailbox databases that have copies with an ActivationPreference value of 1. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - ExchangeLegacyDN
    - GUID

    You can use this parameter as part of ending maintenance mode on a Mailbox server.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox database that you want to activate. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the Server parameter

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseMountDialOverride" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MountDialOverride
  description: |+
    The MountDialOverride parameter is used to override the auto database mount dial (AutoDatabaseMountDial) setting for the target server and specify an alternate setting. The following are possible values:

    - None: When using this value, the currently configured auto database mount dial setting on the target server will be used.
    - Lossless: This is the default value. When using this value, the database doesn't automatically mount until all log files that were generated on the original active copy have been copied to the passive copy.
    - GoodAvailability: If you specify this value, the database automatically mounts immediately after a failover if the copy queue length is less than or equal to 6. If the copy queue length is greater than 6, the database doesn't automatically mount. When the copy queue length is less than or equal to 6, Microsoft Exchange attempts to replicate the remaining logs to the passive copy and then mounts the database.
    - BestEffort: If you specify this value, the database automatically mounts regardless of the size of the copy queue length. Because the database will mount with any amount of log loss, using this value could result in a large amount of data loss.
    - BestAvailability: If you specify this value, the database automatically mounts immediately after a failover if the copy queue length is less than or equal to 12. The copy queue length is the number of logs recognized by the passive copy that needs to be replicated. If the copy queue length is more than 12, the database doesn't automatically mount. When the copy queue length is less than or equal to 12, Exchange attempts to replicate the remaining logs to the passive copy and then mounts the database.

  name: MoveAllDatabasesOrNone
  description: |+
    The MoveAllDatabasesOrNone switch specifies whether to prevent any databases from moving if a single active database on the server can't be moved. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

- type: <xref href="MailboxServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Server parameter specifies the server that you want to move all active mailbox databases from. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - ExchangeLegacyDN
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipActiveCopyChecks
  description: |+
    The SkipActiveCopyChecks switch specifies whether to skip checking the current active copy to see if it's currently a seeding source for any passive databases. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    **Note**: When you use this switch, you can move a database that's currently a seeding source, which cancels the seed operation.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipAllChecks
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The SkipAllChecks switch specifies whether to skip all checks. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch is equivalent to specifying all of the individual skip parameters that are available on this cmdlet.

    You can only use this switch with the ActivateOnServer parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipClientExperienceChecks
  description: |+
    The SkipClientExperienceChecks switch specifies whether to skip the search catalog (content index) state check to see if the search catalog is healthy and up to date. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If the search catalog for the database copy you're activating is in an unhealthy or unusable state and you use this parameter to skip the search catalog health check and activate the database copy, you will need to either re-crawl or reseed the search catalog.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipCpuChecks
  description: |+
    The SkipCpuChecks switch specifies whether to skip the high CPU utilization checks. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipHealthChecks
  description: |+
    The SkipHealthChecks switch specifies whether to bypass passive copy health checks. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    When you use this switch, you can move the active copy to a database copy that's in the Failed state. You should only use this switch if the initial attempt to move the active database has failed. This is because the SkipHealthChecks switch performs additional validation to ensure that the log files are consistent, which can take a considerable amount of time.

  defaultValue: None
