parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllAcceptedDomains
  description: |+
    The AllAcceptedDomains parameter specifies whether the Outbound connector is used in hybrid organizations where message recipients are in accepted domains of the cloud-based organization. Valid values are:

    - $true: The Outbound connector is used in hybrid organizations when message recipients are in an accepted domain of the cloud-based organization. This setting requires OnPremises for the ConnectorType value.
    - $false: The Outbound connector isn't used in hybrid organizations. This is the default value.

    This parameter is effective only for OnPremises connectors.

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CloudServicesMailEnabled
  description: |+
    **Note**: We recommend that you don't use this parameter unless you are directed to do so by Microsoft Customer Service and Support, or by specific product documentation. Instead, use the Hybrid Configuration wizard to configure mail flow between your on-premises and cloud organizations. For more information, see [Hybrid Configuration wizard](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/hybrid-configuration-wizard).

    The CloudServicesMailEnabled parameter specifies whether the connector is used for hybrid mail flow between an on-premises Exchange environment and Microsoft 365. Specifically, this parameter controls how certain internal X-MS-Exchange-Organization-\* message headers are handled in messages that are sent between accepted domains in the on-premises and cloud organizations. These headers are collectively known as cross-premises headers.

    Valid values are:

    - $true: The connector is used for mail flow in hybrid organizations, so cross-premises headers are preserved or promoted in messages that flow through the connector. This is the default value for connectors that are created by the Hybrid Configuration wizard. Certain X-MS-Exchange-Organization-\* headers in outbound messages that are sent from one side of the hybrid organization to the other are converted to X-MS-Exchange-CrossPremises-\* headers and are thereby preserved in messages. X-MS-Exchange-CrossPremises-\* headers in inbound messages that are received on one side of the hybrid organization from the other are promoted to X-MS-Exchange-Organization-\* headers. These promoted headers replace any instances of the same X-MS-Exchange-Organization-\* headers that already exist in messages.
    - $false: The connector isn't used for mail flow in hybrid organizations, so any cross-premises headers are removed from messages that flow through the connector.

  name: Comment

    The Comment parameter specifies an optional comment. If you specify a value that contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example: "This is an admin note".

  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    - Migrated: The connector was originally created in Microsoft Forefront Online Protection for Exchange.

  name: IsTransportRuleScoped
  description: |+
    The IsTransportRuleScoped parameter specifies whether the Outbound connector is associated with a transport rule (also known as a mail flow rule). Valid values are:

    - $true: The connector is associated with a transport rule.
    - $false: The connector isn't associated with a transport rule. This is the default value.

    You scope a transport rule to an Outbound connector by using the RouteMessageOutboundConnector parameter on the New-TransportRule or Set-TransportRule cmdlets. Messages that match the conditions of the transport rule are routed to their destinations by using the specified Outbound connector.
