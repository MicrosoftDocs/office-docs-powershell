parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: AllContentKeywords
  description: |+
    The AllContentKeywords parameter specifies the filters for all of the following:

    - Subject
    - Message body
    - Attachment content

    This allows an OR search of all these fields. If your search criteria are part of the subject, message body, or attachment content, you get results.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowDuplicates
  description: |+
    The AllowDuplicates switch copies mail items without checking if they're duplicates of existing items and without removing duplicate items. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    We recommend that you use this switch with the IncludeFolders parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: AttachmentFilenames
  description: |+
    The AttachmentFilenames parameter specifies the filter for the attachment file name. You can use wildcard characters in the string. For example, you can use \*.txt to export items that have a .txt extension.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BadItemLimit
  description: |+
    The BadItemLimit parameter specifies the number of corrupted items in a mailbox to skip before the export operation fails.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>

- type: <xref href="DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EndDate
  description: |+
    The EndDate parameter specifies the end date for filtering content that will be exported from the source mailbox. Only items in the mailbox whose date is prior to the end date are exported. When you enter a specific date, use the short date format defined in the Regional Options settings configured on the local computer. For example, if your computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 03/01/2010 to specify March 1, 2010.

  name: ExcludeFolders
  description: |+
    The ExcludeFolders parameter specifies the list of folders to exclude during the export. Folders are excluded as they're entered. They aren't localized. For example, excluding calendar only excludes calendar in English because calendar in other languages is a different word.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

  description: |+
    The TargetFolder parameter specifies the mailbox folder that's created on the mailbox specified. This parameter is required if the mailbox being restored is different from the target mailbox. (For example, the value specified with the Identity parameter isn't the same as the value specified with the RecoveryMailbox parameter.) In this case, the Restore-Mailbox command performs a merge. If the values are the same, the TargetFolder parameter isn't required.

description: |-
  The Restore-Mailbox cmdlet copies end-user data from any server running Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 to a mailbox on an Exchange 2010 Mailbox server in the same organization that has adequate space and resources to support the mailbox. The Restore-Mailbox cmdlet can only use disconnected mailboxes on a server as a source of data, and the cmdlet can only use connected mailboxes as a target for data.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
