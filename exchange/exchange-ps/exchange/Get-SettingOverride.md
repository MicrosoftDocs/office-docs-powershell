# Get-SettingOverride

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

**Caution**: Incorrect usage of the setting override cmdlets can cause serious damage to your Exchange organization. This damage could require you to reinstall Exchange. Only use these cmdlets as instructed by product documentation or under the direction of Microsoft Customer Service and Support.

Use the Get-SettingOverride cmdlet to view existing setting overrides that store Exchange customizations in Active Directory instead of in text files on the server.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-SettingOverride [[-Identity] <SettingOverrideIdParameter>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Setting overrides configure and store Exchange server customizations in Active Directory. The settings can be organization-wide or server-specific, and they persist in Active Directory across Exchange Cumulative Updates (CUs). Exchange customizations in web.config or exe.config XML application configuration files are server-specific, and are lost when you install the next Exchange CU.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
