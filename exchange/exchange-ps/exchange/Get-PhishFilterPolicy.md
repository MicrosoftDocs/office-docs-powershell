## DESCRIPTION
The Get-PhishFilterPolicy cmdlet returns the following information:

- Last seen: The date when the sending email address or domain was last seen by Office 365.

- Decision set by: Specifies whether Office 365 set the spoofing policy as allowed or not allowed to spoof, or if it was set by an admin.

- AllowedToSpoof: The three possible values are Yes (messages that contain any spoofed sender email addresses in your organization are allowed from the source messaging server), No (messages that contain any spoofed sender email addresses in your organization are not allowed from the source messaging server), and Partial (messages that contain some spoofed sender email addresses in your organization are allowed from the source messaging server.

- Spoof Type: Indicates whether the domain is internal to your organization or external.
