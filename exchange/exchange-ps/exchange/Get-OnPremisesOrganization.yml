  The OnPremisesOrganization object represents an on-premises Exchange organization configured for hybrid deployment with a Microsoft 365 organization. It's used with the Hybrid Configuration wizard and is typically created automatically when the hybrid deployment is initially configured by the wizard. You can use the Get-OnPremisesOrganization cmdlet to view the properties of the OnPremisesOrganization object in the Microsoft 365 organization.

  Manual modification of this object may result in hybrid deployment misconfiguration. We strongly recommend that you use the Hybrid Configuration wizard to modify this object in the Microsoft 365 organization.
