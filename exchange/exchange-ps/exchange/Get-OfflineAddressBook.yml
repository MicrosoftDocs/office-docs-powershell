### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Get-OfflineAddressBook cmdlet to view offline address books (OABs).

  In Exchange Online, this cmdlet is available only in the Address Lists role, and by default, the role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use this cmdlet, you need to add the Address Lists role to a role group (for example, to the Organization Management role group). For more information, see [Add a role to a role group](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions/role-groups#add-a-role-to-a-role-group).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the OAB that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OAB. For example:

    - Name or \\Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the Server parameter.

  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    **Note**: This parameter isn't relevant in Exchange 2013 or later. The Server property for an OAB is blank, because the OAB is generated by an arbitration mailbox.

    The Server parameter returns all of the OABs that are generated by the specified Exchange 2010 or earlier server. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - FQDN
    - ExchangeLegacyDN
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.
