parameters:
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReadFromDomainController
  description: |+
    The ReadFromDomainController switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    The command: `Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true` to include all objects in the forest requires the ReadFromDomainController switch. Otherwise, the command might use a global catalog that contains outdated information. Also, you might need to run multiple iterations of the command with the ReadFromDomainController switch to get the information.

    By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Unlimited" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ResultSize
  description: |+
    The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of settings to return. If you want to return all settings that match the command, use unlimited for the value of this parameter.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
