  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    The Identity parameter specifies the custom Policy Tip you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the custom Policy Tip. For example:

    - `Locale\Action`: Locale is a supported locale code. For example, en for English or fr for French. For more information about supported locales, see [Supported languages for NDRs](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow/non-delivery-reports-and-bounce-messages/ndr-procedures#supported-languages-for-ndrs).
