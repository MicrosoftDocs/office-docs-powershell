### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Set-Group cmdlet to modify group object settings. If the group is a mail-enabled security group or a distribution group, you can use the Set-DistributionGroup cmdlet to modify other Microsoft Exchange settings that aren't available by using the Set-Group cmdlet.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BypassSecurityGroupManagerCheck
  description: |+
    The BypassSecurityGroupManagerCheck switch specifies whether to allow a user who isn't an owner of the group to modify or delete the group. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you aren't defined in the ManagedBy property of the group, you need to use this switch in commands that modify or delete the group. To use this switch, your account requires specific permissions based on the group type:

    - Distribution groups or mail-enabled security groups: You need to be a member of the Organization Management role group or have the Security Group Creation and Membership role assigned.
    - Role groups: You need to be a member of the Organization Management role group or have the Role Management role assigned.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisplayName
  description: |+
    The DisplayName parameter specifies the display name of the group. The display name is visible in the Exchange admin center and in address lists. The maximum length is 256 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

    This parameter is meaningful only if the group is mail-enabled.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="GroupIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the group that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - GUID

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnoreDefaultScope
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange PowerShell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch enables the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope, but also introduces the following restrictions:

    - You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.
    - You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

- type: <xref href="GeneralRecipientIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ManagedBy
  description: |+
    The ManagedBy parameter specifies an owner for the group. A group must have at least one owner. If you don't use this parameter to specify the owner when you create the group, the user account that created the group is the owner. The group owner is able to:

    - Modify the properties of the group
    - Add or remove group members
    - Delete the group
    - Approve member depart or join requests (if available)
    - Approve messages sent to the group if moderation is enabled, but no moderators are specified.

    The owner you specify for this parameter must be a mailbox, mail user or mail-enabled security group (a mail-enabled security principal that can have permissions assigned). You can use any value that uniquely identifies the owner. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    To enter multiple owners and overwrite all existing entries, use the following syntax: `Owner1,Owner2,...OwnerN`. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Owner1","Owner2",..."OwnerN"`.

    To add or remove owners without affecting other existing entries, use the following syntax: `@{Add="Owner1","Owner2",...; Remove="Owner3","Owner4"...}`.

    Owners that you specify with this parameter are not added as group members. You need to manually add the owners as a members.

    **Note**: Group management in Outlook doesn't work when the owner is a mail-enabled security group. To manage the group in Outlook, the owner must be a mailbox or a mail user.

  name: PhoneticDisplayName
  description: |+

Typically, you use this parameter when the pronunciation and spelling of the user's name don't match. The maximum length is 256 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

  name: WindowsEmailAddress
  description: |+
    The WindowsEmailAddress parameter specifies the Windows email address for this recipient. This is a common Active Directory attribute that's present in all environments, including environments without Exchange. Using the WindowsEmailAddress parameter on a recipient has one of the following results:

    - In environments where the recipient is subject to email address policies (the EmailAddressPolicyEnabled property is set to the value True for the recipient), the WindowsEmailAddress parameter has no effect on the WindowsEmailAddress property or the primary email address value.
    - In environments where the recipient isn't subject to email address policies (the EmailAddressPolicyEnabled property is set to the value False for the recipient), the WindowsEmailAddress parameter updates the WindowsEmailAddress property and the primary email address to the same value.

    The WindowsEmailAddress property is visible for the recipient in Active Directory Users and Computers in the E-mail attribute. The attribute common name is E-mail-Addresses, and the Ldap-Display-Name is mail. If you modify this attribute in Active Directory, the recipient's primary email address is not updated to the same value.
