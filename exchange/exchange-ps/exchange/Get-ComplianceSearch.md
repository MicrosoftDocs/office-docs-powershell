# Get-ComplianceSearch

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-ComplianceSearch cmdlet to view estimate compliance searches in Exchange Server 2016 and in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center. After you use the New-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet to define a preview action for the compliance search, use the Get-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet to view the results of the compliance search.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

You can use any value that uniquely identifies the compliance search. For example:

- OneDriveLocation

To view these properties, you need to use the Identity parameter in the command.
