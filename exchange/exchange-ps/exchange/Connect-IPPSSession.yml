### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in the Exchange Online PowerShell module. For more information, see [About the Exchange Online PowerShell module](https://aka.ms/exov3-module).

  Use the Connect-IPPSSession cmdlet in the Exchange Online PowerShell module to connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell using modern authentication. The cmdlet works for MFA or non-MFA enabled accounts.

  **Note**: Version 3.2.0 or later of the module supports REST API mode for virtually all Security & Compliance PowerShell cmdlets (Basic authentication in WinRM on the local computer isn't required for REST API mode). For more information, see [Prerequisites for the Exchange Online PowerShell module](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2#prerequisites-for-the-exchange-online-powershell-module).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri
  description: |+
    The AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri parameter specifies the Microsoft Entra Authorization endpoint that can issue OAuth2 access tokens. The following PowerShell environments and related values are supported:

    - Security & Compliance PowerShell in Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 GCC: Don't use this parameter. The required value is `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common`, but that's also the default value, so you don't need to use this parameter.
    - Security & Compliance PowerShell in Office 365 operated by 21Vianet: `https://login.chinacloudapi.cn/common`
    - Security & Compliance PowerShell in Microsoft GCC High or Microsoft DoD: `https://login.microsoftonline.us/common`

    If you use the UserPrincipalName parameter, you don't need to use the AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri parameter for MFA or federated users in environments that normally require it (UserPrincipalName or AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri is required; OK to use both).

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BypassMailboxAnchoring
  description: |+
    The BypassMailboxAnchoring switch bypasses the use of the mailbox anchoring hint. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="X509Certificate2" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Certificate
  description: |+
    The Certificate parameter specifies the certificate that's used for certificate-based authentication (CBA). A valid value is the X509Certificate2 object value of the certificate.

    Don't use this parameter with the CertificateFilePath or CertificateThumbprint parameters.

    For more information about CBA, see [App-only authentication for unattended scripts in the Exchange Online PowerShell module](https://aka.ms/exo-cba).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateFilePath
  description: |+
    The CertificateFilePath parameter specifies the certificate that's used for CBA. A valid value is the complete public path to the certificate file. Use the CertificatePassword parameter with this parameter.

    Don't use this parameter with the Certificate or CertificateThumbprint parameters.

    For more information about CBA, see [App-only authentication for unattended scripts in the Exchange Online PowerShell module](https://aka.ms/exo-cba).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SecureString" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificatePassword
  description: |+
    The CertificatePassword parameter specifies the password that's required to open the certificate file when you use the CertificateFilePath parameter to identify the certificate that's used for CBA.

    You can use the following methods as a value for this parameter:

    - `(ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<password>' -AsPlainText -Force)`.
    - Before you run this command, store the password as a variable (for example, `$password = Read-Host "Enter password" -AsSecureString`), and then use the variable (`$password`) for the value.
    - `(Get-Credential).password` to be prompted to enter the password securely when you run this command.

    For more information about CBA, see [App-only authentication for unattended scripts in the Exchange Online PowerShell module](https://aka.ms/exo-cba).

    **Note**: Using a **ConvertTo-SecureString** command to store the password of the certificate locally defeats the purpose of a secure connection method for automation scenarios. Using a **Get-Credential** command to prompt you for the password of the certificate securely isn't ideal for automation scenarios. In other words, there's really no automated _and_ secure way to connect using a local certificate.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateThumbprint
  description: |+
    The CertificateThumbprint parameter specifies the certificate that's used for CBA. A valid value is the thumbprint value of the certificate. For example, `83213AEAC56D61C97AEE5C1528F4AC5EBA7321C1`.

    Don't use this parameter with the Certificate or CertificateFilePath parameters.

    **Note**: The CertificateThumbprint parameter is supported only in Microsoft Windows.

    For more information about CBA, see [App-only authentication for unattended scripts in the Exchange Online PowerShell module](https://aka.ms/exo-cba).

  name: CommandName
  description: |+
    The CommandName parameter specifies the comma separated list of commands to import into the session. Use this parameter for applications or scripts that use a specific set of cmdlets. Reducing the number of cmdlets in the session helps improve performance and reduces the memory footprint of the application or script.

  name: ConnectionUri
  description: |+
    The ConnectionUri parameter specifies the connection endpoint for the PowerShell session. The following PowerShell environments and related values are supported:

    - Security & Compliance PowerShell in Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 GCC: Don't use this parameter. The required value is `https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/`, but that's also the default value, so you don't need to use this parameter.
    - Security & Compliance PowerShell in Office 365 operated by 21Vianet: `https://ps.compliance.protection.partner.outlook.cn/powershell-liveid`
    - Security & Compliance PowerShell in Microsoft GCC High: `https://ps.compliance.protection.office365.us/powershell-liveid/`

- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions. Don't use this parameter for accounts that use multi-factor authentication (MFA).

    Before you run the Connect-IPPSSession command, store the username and password in a variable (for example, `$UserCredential = Get-Credential`). Then, use the variable name (`$UserCredential`) for this parameter.

    After the Connect-IPPSSession command is complete, the password key in the variable is emptied.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DelegatedOrganization
  description: |+
    The DelegatedOrganization parameter specifies the customer organization that you want to manage (for example, contosoelectronics.onmicrosoft.com). This parameter works only if the customer organization has agreed to your delegated management via the CSP program.

    After you successfully authenticate, the cmdlets in this session are mapped to the customer organization, and all operations in this session are done on the customer organization.

    **Notes**:

    - Use the primary .onmicrosoft.com domain of the delegated organization for the value of this parameter.
    - You must use the AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri parameter with this parameter.

  name: Prefix
  description: |+
    The Prefix parameter specifies a text value to add to the names of Security & Compliance PowerShell cmdlets when you connect. For example, Get-ComplianceCase becomes Get-ContosoComplianceCase when you use the value Contoso for this parameter.

    - The Prefix value can't contain spaces or special characters like underscores or asterisks.
    - You can't use the Prefix value EXO. That value is reserved for the nine exclusive **Get-EXO\*** cmdlets that are built into the module.
    - The Prefix parameter affects only imported Security & Compliance cmdlet names. It doesn't affect the names of cmdlets that are built into the module (for example, Disconnect-ExchangeOnline).

- type: <xref href="PSSessionOption" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PSSessionOption
  description: |+
    **Note**: This parameter doesn't work in REST API connections.

    The PSSessionOption parameter specifies the remote PowerShell session options to use in your connection to Security & Compliance PowerShell. This parameter works only if you also use the UseRPSSession switch in the same command.

    Store the output of the [New-PSSessionOption](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/new-pssessionoption) command in a variable (for example, `$PSOptions = New-PSSessionOption <Settings>`), and use the variable name as the value for this parameter (for example, `$PSOptions`).

  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UserPrincipalName
  description: |+
    The UserPrincipalName parameter specifies the account that you want to use to connect (for example, navin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com). Using this parameter allows you to skip entering a username in the modern authentication credentials prompt (you're prompted to enter a password).

    If you use the UserPrincipalName parameter, you don't need to use the AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri parameter for MFA or federated users in environments that normally require it (UserPrincipalName or AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri is required; OK to use both).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseRPSSession
  description: |+
    This parameter is available in version 3.2.0 or later of the module.

    **Note**: Remote PowerShell connections to Security & Compliance are deprecated. For more information, see [Deprecation of Remote PowerShell in Security and Compliance PowerShell](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/deprecation-of-remote-powershell-rps-protocol-in-security-and/ba-p/3815432).

    The UseRPSSession switch allows you to connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell using traditional remote PowerShell access to all cmdlets. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch requires that Basic authentication is enabled in WinRM on the local computer. For more information, see [Turn on Basic authentication in WinRM](https://aka.ms/exov3-module#turn-on-basic-authentication-in-winrm).

    If you don't use this switch, Basic authentication in WinRM is not required.
