# Get-OfflineAddressBook

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-OfflineAddressBook cmdlet to view offline address books (OABs).

By default in Exchange Online, the Address List role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use any cmdlets that require the Address List role, you need to add the role to a role group. For more information, see the "Add a role to a role group" section in the topic, Manage role groups.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you.

This example returns a summary list of all existing OABs.

### Example 2

```

This example returns detailed information about the OAB named Default Offline Address Book.

### Example 3
```

```

This example returns specific properties for all existing OABs, including the GeneratingMailbox property that specifies the arbitration mailbox that's responsible for generating the OAB.

## PARAMETERS

### -Server
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Note: This parameter isn't relevant in Exchange 2013 or later. The Server property for an OAB is blank, because the OAB is generated by an arbitration mailbox.

The Server parameter returns all of the OABs that are generated by the specified Exchange 2010 or earlier server. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- FQDN

- ExchangeLegacyDN

- GUID

You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

### -DomainController
