# Get-ManagedFolder

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

Use the Get-ManagedFolder cmdlet to retrieve the attributes of one or more managed folders.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Get-ManagedFolder [[-Identity] <ELCFolderIdParameter>]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Organization <OrganizationIdParameter>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Mailbox
```
Get-ManagedFolder [-Mailbox <MailboxIdParameter>]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Organization <OrganizationIdParameter>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-ManagedFolder cmdlet retrieves the specified managed folder attributes:

- If only an Identity parameter value is present, the command retrieves the specified folder and all associated attributes.

- If a Mailbox parameter value is present, the command retrieves all managed folders that apply to that user by means of a managed folder mailbox policy applied by an administrator. Managed folders that users add by means of an organization's managed folder opt-in Web site aren't displayed by this command.

- If no parameter values are specified, the command retrieves all the folder objects and their associated attributes.

The Get-ManagedFolder cmdlet accepts a ManagedFolder object or an identity string as pipelined input.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-ManagedFolder MyManagedFolder | Format-List
```

This example retrieves information about the managed folder MyManagedFolder. The output of the Get-ManagedFolder cmdlet is piped to the Format-List cmdlet so that all the available information is displayed in the result.
