parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExcludeRecipientTest
  description: |+
    The ExcludeRecipientTest switch specifies whether to exclude validation of recipient data synchronization. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you use this switch, only the synchronization of configuration objects is validated. Validating that recipient data is synchronized takes longer than validating only configuration data.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FullCompareMode
  description: |+
    The FullCompareMode switch specifies whether a full comparison of the configuration data between Active Directory and AD LDS instance on the target Edge Transport server is performed. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    If you don't use this switch, a full comparison of replicated configuration data is skipped and the command only tests the Edge synchronization by verifying the replication cookie.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Unlimited" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaxReportSize
  description: |+
    The MaxReportSize parameter specifies the total number of objects and properties listed in the results. The results output by this command include a list of all out-of-sync objects and properties in both AD LDS and Active Directory. If the directory services aren't synchronized, a large amount of data can result. If you don't specify a value for this parameter, the default value of 1,000 is used. The minimum value for this parameter is 1. The maximum value for this parameter is unlimited.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MonitoringContext
  description: |+
    The MonitoringContext parameter specifies whether to include the associated monitoring events and performance counters in the results. Valid values are:

    - $true: Monitoring events and performance counters are included in the command results. Typically, you include the monitoring events and performance counters in the results when the output is passed to Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM).
    - $false: Monitoring events and performance counters aren't included in the command results. This is the default value.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TargetServer
  description: |+
    The TargetServer parameter specifies an Edge Transport server to initiate edge synchronization with. If omitted, all Edge Transport servers are synchronized.

    You may want to use this parameter to specify a single Edge Transport server for synchronization if a new Edge Transport server has been installed or if that Edge Transport server has been unavailable for some time.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010

  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ProxyAddress" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: VerifyRecipient
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The VerifyRecipient parameter specifies a single recipient with which to verify the synchronization status. You identify the recipient by specifying a proxy address assigned to the recipient. The proxy address is the recipient's email address. The recipient verification test is mutually exclusive of the test that verifies synchronization of configuration data.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None

name: Test-EdgeSynchronization
description: |-
  The Test-EdgeSynchronization cmdlet is a diagnostic cmdlet that provides a report of the synchronization status of subscribed Edge Transport servers. You can use the VerifyRecipient parameter with this cmdlet to verify that a single recipient has been synchronized to the Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) instance. The Edge Subscription process establishes one-way replication of recipient and configuration information from Active Directory to AD LDS.

  This cmdlet compares the data stored in Active Directory and the data stored in AD LDS. Any inconsistencies in data are reported in the results output by this cmdlet.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
