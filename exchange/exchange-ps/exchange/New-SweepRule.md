## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
New-SweepRule -Name "From Michelle" -Mailbox "Felipe Apodaca" -Provider Exchange16 -Sender michelle@fabrikam.com -KeepLatest 1
```

This example creates a new Sweep rule named "From Michelle" in Felipe Apodaca's mailbox that keeps the latest message from michelle@fabrikam.com in the Inbox folder, and moves older messages to the Deleted Items folder.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
New-SweepRule -Name "From Lila" -Mailbox "Felipe Apodaca" -Provider Exchange16 -Sender lila@fabrikam.com -KeepForDays 10
```

This example creates a new Sweep rule named "From Lila" in Felipe Apodaca's mailbox that moves messages from lila@fabrikam.com in the Inbox folder that are older than 10 days to the Deleted Items folder.

## PARAMETERS

### -Name
The Name parameter specifies the name of the Sweep rule. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Provider
The Provider parameter specifies the provider for the Sweep rule. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks.

For Sweep rules that you create in Outlook on the web, the default value is Exchange16.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

### -Enabled
The Enabled parameter specifies whether the Sweep rule is enabled or disabled. Valid values are:

### -KeepForDays
