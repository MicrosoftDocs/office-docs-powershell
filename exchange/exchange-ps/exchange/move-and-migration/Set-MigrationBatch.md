## DESCRIPTION
The Set-MigrationBatch cmdlet configures your existing migration batches to migrate mailboxes and mailbox data in one of the following scenarios:

- Local move

- Cross-forest move

- Remote move

- Cutover Exchange migration

- Staged Exchange migration

- IMAP migration

- G Suite migration

Some settings can be applied both to the batch as well as to individual users within the batch. It is important to note that when a setting is applied to a user it will override any corresponding setting on the batch.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-MigrationBatch -Identity MigrationBatch01 -AutoRetryCount 5 -AllowIncrementalSyncs $true
```

This example updates MigrationBatch01 with new AutoRetryCount and AllowIncrementalSyncs parameter settings.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the migration batch that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the migration batch. For example:

- Name (the Identity property value)

- GUID (the BatchGuid property value)

```yaml
Type: MigrationBatchIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllowIncrementalSyncs
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The AllowIncrementalSyncs parameter specifies whether to enable or disable incremental synchronization. Valid values are:

- $true: Incremental synchronization is enabled. Any new messages that are sent to the source mailbox are copied to the corresponding target mailbox once every 24 hours.

- $false: Incremental synchronization is disabled. The migration batch will go into the Stopped state after the initial synchronization is complete. To complete a migration batch for local moves, cross-forest moves, or remote move migrations, you need to enable incremental synchronization.

```yaml
Type: $true | $false
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllowUnknownColumnsInCsv
The AllowUnknownColumnsInCsv parameter specifies whether to allow extra columns in the CSV file that aren't used by migration. Valid values are:

- $true: The migration ignores (silently skips) unknown columns in the CSV file (including optional columns with misspelled column headers). All unknown columns are treated like extra columns that aren't used by migration.

- $false: The migration fails if there are any unknown columns in the CSV file. This setting protects against spelling errors in column headers. This is the default value.

```yaml
Type: $true | $false
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AutoRetryCount
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The AutoRetryCount parameter specifies the number of attempts to restart the migration batch to migrate mailboxes that encountered errors.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BadItemLimit
The BadItemLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of bad items that are allowed before the migration request fails. A bad item is a corrupt item in the source mailbox that can't be copied to the target mailbox. Also included in the bad item limit are missing items. Missing items are items in the source mailbox that can't be found in the target mailbox when the migration request is ready to complete.

Valid input for this parameter is an integer or the value unlimited. The default value is 0, which means the migration request will fail if any bad items are detected. If you are OK with leaving a few bad items behind, you can set this parameter to a reasonable value (we recommend 10 or lower) so the migration request can proceed. If too many bad items are detected, consider using the New-MailboxRepairRequest cmdlet to attempt to fix corrupted items in the source mailbox, and try the migration request again.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CompleteAfter
This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

The CompleteAfter parameter specifies a delay before the batch is completed. Data migration for the batch will start, but won't complete until the date/time you specify with this parameter.

Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

In Exchange Online, if you specify a date/time value without a time zone, the value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

To specify a date/time value for this parameter, use either of the following options:

- Specify the date/time value in UTC: For example, "2016-05-06 14:30:00z".

- Specify the date/time value as a formula that converts the date/time in your local time zone to UTC: For example, (Get-Date "5/6/2016 9:30 AM").ToUniversalTime(). For more information, see Get-Date (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=113313).

```yaml
Type: DateTime
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CSVData
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The CSVData parameter specifies the CSV file that contains information about the user mailboxes to be moved or migrated. The required attributes in the header row of the CSV file vary depending on the type of migration. Use the following format for the value of this parameter: ([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes(\<path of the CSV migration file\>)). For example: -CSVData ([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\MigrationBatch\_1.csv"))

```yaml
Type: Byte[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LargeItemLimit
The LargeItemLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of large items that are allowed before the migration request fails. A large item is a message in the source mailbox that exceeds the maximum message size that's allowed in the target mailbox. If the target mailbox doesn't have a specifically configured maximum message size value, the organization-wide value is used.

For more information about maximum message size values, see the following topics:

- Exchange 2016: Message size limits in Exchange 2016 (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb124345.aspx)

- Exchange Online: Exchange Online Limits (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=524926)

Valid input for this parameter is an integer or the value unlimited. The default value is 0, which means the migration request will fail if any large items are detected. If you are OK with leaving a few large items behind, you can set this parameter to a reasonable value (we recommend 10 or lower) so the migration request can proceed.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MoveOptions
The MoveOptions parameter specifies the stages of the migration that you want to skip for debugging purposes. Don't use this parameter unless you're directed to do so by Microsoft Customer Service and Support or specific documentation.

Don't use this parameter with the SkipMoving parameter.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NotificationEmails
The NotificationEmails parameter specifies one or more email addresses that migration status reports are sent to.

If you don't use this parameter, the status report isn't sent.

To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: \<value1\>,\<value2\>,...\<valueN\>. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, you need to use the following syntax: "\<value1\>","\<value2\>",..."\<valueN\>".

To add or remove one or more values without affecting any existing entries, use the following syntax: @{Add="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...; Remove="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...}.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ReportInterval
The ReportInterval parameter specifies how frequently emailed reports should be sent to the email addresses listed within NotificationEmails.

By default, emailed reports are sent every 24 hours for a batch. Setting this value to 0 indicates that reports should never be sent for this batch.

This parameter should only be used in the cloud-based service.

```yaml
Type: TimeSpan
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SkipMoving
This parameter has been replaced by the MoveOptions parameter.

The SkipMoving parameter specifies the stages of the migration that you want to skip for debugging purposes. Don't use this parameter unless you're directed to do so by Microsoft Customer Service and Support or specific documentation.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SourcePublicFolderDatabase
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The SourcePublicFolderDatabase parameter specifies the source public folder database that's used in a public folder migration. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

```yaml
Type: DatabaseIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StartAfter
The StartAfter parameter specifies a delay before the data migration for the users within the batch is started. The migration will be prepared, but the actual data migration for users within the batch won't start until the date/time you specify with this parameter.

Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

In Exchange Online, if you specify a date/time value without a time zone, the value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

To specify a date/time value for this parameter, use either of the following options:

- Specify the date/time value in UTC: For example, "2016-05-06 14:30:00z".

- Specify the date/time value as a formula that converts the date/time in your local time zone to UTC: For example, (Get-Date "5/6/2016 9:30 AM").ToUniversalTime(). For more information, see Get-Date (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=113313).

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SyncNow
The SyncNow switch starts an immediate sync for users that have already reached Synced status, but doesn't resume any Failed users. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

You can use this switch to speed up onboarding moves by using the switch just before the completion of the move. For IMAP migrations, you can use this switch after MX record switchover.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Update
The Update switch sets the Update flag on the migration batch. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

The Update flag triggers the Migration Service to reapply all of the settings from the endpoint, batch, and user to the migration process.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
