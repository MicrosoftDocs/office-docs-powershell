### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Get-RecoverableItems items cmdlet to view deleted items in mailboxes. After you find the deleted items, you use the Restore-RecoverableItems cmdlet to restore them.

  This cmdlet is available only in the Mailbox Import Export role, and by default, the role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use this cmdlet, you need to add the Mailbox Import Export role to a role group (for example, to the Organization Management role group). For more information, see [Add a role to a role group](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/permissions/role-groups#add-a-role-to-a-role-group).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EntryID
  description: |+
    The EntryID parameter specifies the deleted item that you want to restore. The EntryID value for the deleted item is unique in the mailbox.

    You can find the EntryID for specific items by using other search filters on the Get-RecoverableItems cmdlet (subject, date range, etc.).

    The FilterEndTime specifies the end date/time of the date range. This parameter uses the LastModifiedTime value of the item.

    Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".
