 [-AllowLegacyExchangeTokens]
 [-TenantId <String>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-AuthenticationPolicy | Format-Table -Auto Name
```

This example returns a summary list of all authentication policies.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-AuthenticationPolicy -Identity "Engineering Group"
```

This example returns detailed information for the authentication policy named Engineering Group.

### Example 3
```powershell
Get-AuthenticationPolicy -AllowLegacyExchangeTokens
```

In Exchange Online, this example specifies whether legacy Exchange tokens for Outlook add-ins are allowed in the organization.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the authentication policy you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

```yaml
Type: AuthPolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllowLegacyExchangeTokens
This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

The AllowLegacyExchangeTokens switch specifies whether legacy Exchange tokens are allowed for Outlook add-ins in your organization. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

Legacy Exchange tokens include Exchange user identity and callback tokens.

This switch also specifies a date and time sometime within the past seven days when an add-in was either allowed or blocked from acquiring a token.

**Important**:

- An update is being deployed to enable the AllowLegacyExchangeTokens switch to specify any add-in that requested an Exchange token from the last seven days. For more information, see [Get the status of legacy Exchange Online tokens and add-ins that use them](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/turn-exchange-tokens-on-off#get-the-status-of-legacy-exchange-online-tokens-and-add-ins-that-use-them).
- The AllowLegacyExchangeTokens switch returns `Not Set` if tokens haven't been explicitly allowed or blocked in your organization using the _AllowLegacyExchangeTokens_ or _BlockLegacyExchangeTokens_ parameters on the **Set-AuthenticationPolicy** cmdlet. For more information, see [Get the status of legacy Exchange Online tokens and add-ins that use them](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/turn-exchange-tokens-on-off#get-the-status-of-legacy-exchange-online-tokens-and-add-ins-that-use-them).
- As of February 17 2025, legacy Exchange tokens are blocked by default in all cloud-based organizations. Although tokens are blocked by default, the AllowLegacyExchangeTokens switch still returns `Not Set` if you haven't used the _AllowLegacyExchangeTokens_ or _BlockLegacyExchangeTokens_ parameters on the **Set-AuthenticationPolicy** cmdlet.
