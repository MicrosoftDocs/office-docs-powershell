description: |-
  When you configure a user or computer account to bypass mailbox audit logging, access or actions taken by the user account or computer account to any mailbox isn't logged. By bypassing trusted user accounts or computer accounts that need to access mailboxes frequently, you can reduce the noise in mailbox audit logs.
