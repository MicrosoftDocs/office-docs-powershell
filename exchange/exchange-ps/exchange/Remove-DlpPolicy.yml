  **Note**: This cmdlet has been retired from the cloud-based service. For more information, see [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/exchange-online-etrs-to-stop-supporting-dlp-policies/ba-p/3886713). Use the Remove-DlpCompliancePolicy and Remove-DlpComplianceRule cmdlets instead.

  This cmdlet is functional only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Remove-DlpPolicy cmdlet to remove existing data loss prevention (DLP) policies that are based on transport rules (mail flow rules) from your organization.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
