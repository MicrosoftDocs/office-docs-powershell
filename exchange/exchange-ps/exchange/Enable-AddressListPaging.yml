### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Enable-AddressListPaging cmdlet to enable Active Directory virtual list view for address lists. Virtual list view allows you to display the address lists in your organization as pages instead of loading and viewing the entire directory.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  The Enable-AddressListPaging cmdlet creates the Address List container in Active Directory. Recipient cmdlets, such as Get-Recipient, use the information written to the container to quickly retrieve recipient data.
