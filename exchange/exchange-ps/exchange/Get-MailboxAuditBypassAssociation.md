# Get-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation cmdlet to retrieve user or computer accounts configured to bypass mailbox audit logging.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation [[-Identity] <MailboxAuditBypassAssociationIdParameter>]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-ResultSize <Unlimited>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
When you configure a user or computer account to bypass mailbox audit logging, access or actions taken by the user or computer account to any mailbox isn't logged. By bypassing trusted user or computer accounts that need to access mailboxes frequently, you can reduce the noise in mailbox audit logs.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
