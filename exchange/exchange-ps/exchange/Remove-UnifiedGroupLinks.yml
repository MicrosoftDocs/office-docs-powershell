### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

  Use the Remove-UnifiedGroupLinks cmdlet to remove members, owners and subscribers from Microsoft 365 Groups in your cloud-based organization. To add members, owners and subscribers, use the Add-UnifiedGroupLinks cmdlet. To modify other properties of Microsoft 365 Groups, use the Set-UnifiedGroup cmdlet.

  **Note**: You can't use this cmdlet to modify Microsoft 365 Group members, owners, or subscribers if you connect using certificate based authentication (also known as CBA or app-only authentication for unattended scripts) or Azure managed identity. You can use Microsoft Graph instead. For more information, see [Group resource type](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the Microsoft 365 Group that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the Microsoft 365 Group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

  name: Links
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Links parameter specifies the recipients to remove from the Microsoft 365 Group. You specify whether these recipients are members, owners, or subscribers by using the LinkType parameter.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

    You must use this parameter with the LinkType parameter, which means the specified recipients will all be removed from the same role in the Microsoft 365 Group (you can't remove different roles from specific recipients in the same command).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="LinkType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LinkType
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The LinkType parameter specifies the recipient's role in the Microsoft 365 Group that you want to remove. Valid values are:

    - Members: Participate in conversations, create Teams channels, collaborate on files, and edit the connected SharePoint site.
    - Owners: Add or remove members, delete conversations, changes Team settings, delete the Team, and full control of the connected SharePoint site. A group must have at least one owner.
    - Subscribers: Members who receive conversation and calendar event notifications from the group. All subscribers are members of the group, but all members aren't necessarily subscribers (depending on the AutoSubscribeNewMembers property value of the group and when the member was added).

    You must use this parameter with the LinkType parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
