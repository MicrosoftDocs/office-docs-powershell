# Get-PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequest

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequest cmdlet to view the status of individual jobs in public folder migration batches that were created by using the New-MigrationBatch cmdlet.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

### Filtering
```
Get-PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequest [-BatchName <String>]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-HighPriority <Boolean>]
 [-Name <String>]
 [-RequestQueue <DatabaseIdParameter>]
 [-ResultSize <Unlimited>]
 [-Status <RequestStatus>]
 [-Suspend <Boolean>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Identity
```
Get-PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequest [[-Identity] <PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequestIdParameter>]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-ResultSize <Unlimited>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequest cmdlet displays the following properties by default.

- Name: The name assigned by the system to a specific mailbox migration job.

- TargetMailbox: The mailbox being migrated.

- Status: The current status of the job.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequest
```

This example returns information about all migration requests.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequest -HighPriority $true
```

In on-premises Exchange, this example returns all migration requests that have a priority value of High, Higher, Highest or Emergency.

### Example 3
```powershell
Get-PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequest | ?{$_.TargetMailbox -eq $null}
```

This example returns public folder mailbox migration requests that don't have a target mailbox.

### Example 4
```powershell
Get-PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequest | group TargetMailbox |?{$_.Count -gt 1}
```

This example returns duplicate public folder migration requests (requests created for the same target mailbox). If the command returns no results, then there are no duplicate migration requests.

## PARAMETERS

### -BatchName
The BatchName parameter filters the results by the friendly BatchName value that was assigned when the batch job was created. The format of this value is: MigrationService:\<Batch name provided at batch creation\>.

You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.
