## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
New-MalwareFilterRule -Name "Contoso Recipients" -MalwareFilterPolicy "Contoso Malware Filter Policy" -RecipientDomainIs contoso.com
```

This example creates a new malware filter rule named Contoso Recipients with the following settings: If the recipient is in the domain contoso.com, apply the malware filter policy named Contoso Malware Filter Policy.

## PARAMETERS

### -MalwareFilterPolicy
The MalwareFilterPolicy parameter specifies the malware filter policy to apply to messages that match the conditions defined by this malware filter rule.

You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example, you can specify the name, GUID, or distinguished name (DN) of the content filter policy.

You can't specify the default malware filter policy. And, you can't specify a malware filter policy that's already associated with another malware filter rule.

```yaml
Type: MalwareFilterPolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the malware filter rule.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Comments
The Comments parameter specifies informative comments for the rule, such as what the rule is used for or how it has changed over time. The length of the comment can't exceed 1024 characters.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New and Set cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Enabled
The Enabled parameter enables or disables the malware filter rule. Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false. The default value is $true.

```yaml
Type: $true | $false
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs
The ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients with email address in the specified domains. You can specify multiple domains separated by commas.

```yaml
Type: Word[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfSentTo
The ExceptIfSentTo parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients in messages. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Display name

- Email address

- GUID

To enter multiple values, use the following syntax: `<value1>,<value2>,...<valueX>`. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: "<value1>","<value2>",..."<valueX>".

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfSentToMemberOf
The ExceptIfSentToMemberOf parameter specifies an exception that looks for messages sent to members of groups. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Display name

- Email address

- GUID

To enter multiple values, use the following syntax: `<value1>,<value2>,...<valueX>`. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: "<value1>","<value2>",..."<valueX>".

If you remove the group after you create the rule, no exception is made for messages that are sent to members of the group.

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Priority
The Priority parameter specifies a priority value for the rule that determines the order of rule processing. A lower integer value indicates a higher priority, the value 0 is the highest priority, and rules can't have the same priority value.

Valid values and the default value for this parameter depend on the number of existing rules. For example, if there are 8 existing rules:

- Valid priority values for the existing 8 rules are from 0 through 7.

- Valid priority values for a new rule (the 9th rule) are from 0 through 8.

- The default value for a new rule (the 9th rule) is 8.

If you modify the priority value of a rule, the position of the rule in the list changes to match the priority value you specify. In other words, if you set the priority value of a rule to the same value as an existing rule, the priority value of the existing rule and all other lower priority rules after it is increased by 1.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RecipientDomainIs
The RecipientDomainIs parameter specifies a condition that looks for recipients with email address in the specified domains. You can specify multiple domains separated by commas.

```yaml
Type: Word[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SentTo
The SentTo parameter specifies a condition that looks for recipients in messages. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Display name

- Email address

- GUID

To enter multiple values, use the following syntax: `<value1>,<value2>,...<valueX>`. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: "<value1>","<value2>",..."<valueX>".

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SentToMemberOf
The SentToMemberOf parameter specifies a condition that looks for messages sent to members of groups. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Display name

- Email address

- GUID

To enter multiple values, use the following syntax: `<value1>,<value2>,...<valueX>`. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: "<value1>","<value2>",..."<valueX>".

If you remove the group after you create the rule, no action is taken on messages that are sent to members of the group.

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
