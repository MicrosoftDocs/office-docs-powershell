# Update-SafeList

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Update-SafeList cmdlet to update the safelist aggregation data in Active Directory. Safelist aggregation data is used in the built-in anti-spam filtering in Microsoft Exchange. EdgeSync replicates safelist aggregation data to Edge Transport servers in the perimeter network.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Update-SafeList [-Identity] <MailboxIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-EnsureJunkEmailRule]
 [-IncludeDomains] [-Type <SafeSenders | SafeRecipients | Both | BlockedSenders | All>] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Update-SafeList cmdlet reads the safelist aggregation data stored on a Microsoft Outlook user mailbox and then hashes and writes the data to the corresponding user object in Active Directory. The command compares the binary attribute created to any value stored on the attribute. If the two values are identical, the command doesn't update the user attribute value with the safelist aggregation data. Safelist aggregation data contains the Outlook user's Safe Senders List and Safe Recipients List.

Be mindful of the network and replication traffic that may be generated when you run the Update-SafeList cmdlet. Running the command on multiple mailboxes where safelists are heavily used may generate a significant amount of traffic. We recommend that if you run the command on multiple mailboxes, you should run the command during off-peak, non-business hours.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
Update-Safelist kim@contoso.com
```

This example updates Safe Senders List data for the single user kim@contoso.com.

### Example 2
```
Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true; Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox | Update-Safelist
```

This example updates safelist data for all user mailboxes in your Exchange organization. By default, the Exchange Management Shell is configured to retrieve or modify objects that reside in the domain in which the Exchange server resides. Therefore, to retrieve all the mailboxes in your Exchange organization, you must first set the scope of the Shell to the entire forest using the Set-AdServerSettings cmdlet. For more information, see Set-AdServerSettings.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox from which you want to collect safelist aggregation data. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox.

For example:

- Name

- Display name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- \<domain name\>\\\<account name\>

- Email address

- GUID

- LegacyExchangeDN

- SamAccountName

- User ID or user principal name (UPN)

```yaml
Type: MailboxIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnsureJunkEmailRule
The EnsureJunkEmailRule parameter specifies whether to force the junk email rule to be turned on for the mailbox if the rule isn't turned on already.

The junk email rule can only be created after the user logs on to the mailbox. If the user has never logged on to the mailbox, this parameter can't turn on the junk email rule.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IncludeDomains
The IncludeDomains switch specifies whether to include the sender domains specified by users in Outlook in the safelist aggregation data. By default, domains specified by the senders aren't included.

In most cases, we don't recommend that you include domains because users may include the domains of large Internet service providers (ISPs), which could unintentionally provide addresses that may be used or spoofed by spammers.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Type
The Type parameter specifies which user-generated list is updated to the user object. Valid values for this parameter are SafeSenders, SafeRecipients, and Both. The default value is SafeSenders.

The safelist aggregation feature doesn't act on Safe Recipients List data. We don't recommend running the Type parameter with the SafeRecipients or Both values.

```yaml
Type: SafeSenders | SafeRecipients | Both | BlockedSenders | All
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
