# Release-QuarantineMessage

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Release-QuarantineMessage cmdlet to release messages from quarantine in your cloud-based organization. You can release messages to all original recipients, or to specific recipients.

For files that are protected by Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams, you can unblock the files in the respective team sites and document libraries by using the Release-QuarantineMessage cmdlet so users can access, share, and download the files.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-QuarantineMessage -MessageID "<5c695d7e-6642-4681-a4b0-9e7a86613cb7@contoso.com>" | Release-QuarantineMessage -User julia@contoso.com
```

This example uses the Get-QuarantineMessage cmdlet to release the quarantined message with the Message-ID value `<5c695d7e-6642-4681-a4b0-9e7a86613cb7@contoso.com>` to an original recipient julia@contoso.com.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Release-QuarantineMessage -Identity c14401cf-aa9a-465b-cfd5-08d0f0ca37c5\4c2ca98e-94ea-db3a-7eb8-3b63657d4db7 -ReleaseToAll
```

This example releases the quarantined message with the specified Identity value to all original recipients.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-QuarantineMessage | Release-QuarantineMessage -ReleaseToAll
```

This example releases all messages to all original recipients.

### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```
$q = Get-QuarantineMessage -QuarantineTypes SPOMalware; $q[-1] | Release-QuarantineMessage -Organization -ReleaseToAll
```

This example releases a file that was quaranantined as part of Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection. The first command stores all SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams quarantined files in the variable $q. The second command releases the last file in the list.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identities
The Identities parameter identifies quarantined messages for bulk operations. You identify the messages by using the syntax: value1,value2,...valueN. The value is a unique quarantined message identifier in the format GUID1>\GUID2 (for example c14401cf-aa9a-465b-cfd5-08d0f0ca37c5\4c2ca98e-94ea-db3a-7eb8-3b63657d4db7).

You can find the identity value for a quarantined message by using the Get-QuarantineMessage cmdlet.

When you use this parameter, the Identity parameter is required, but the value is ignored. For example, use the value 000 for the Identity parameter.

```yaml
Type: QuarantineMessageIdentity[]
Parameter Sets: Set2
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

```yaml
Type: QuarantineMessageIdentity[]
Parameter Sets: Set3, Set4
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the quarantined message that you want to release. The value is a unique quarantined message identifier in the format GUID1\GUID2 (for example c14401cf-aa9a-465b-cfd5-08d0f0ca37c5\4c2ca98e-94ea-db3a-7eb8-3b63657d4db7).

You can find the Identity value for a quarantined message by using the Get-QuarantineMessage cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: QuarantineMessageIdentity
Parameter Sets: Set2, Set3, Set4
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

```yaml
Type: QuarantineMessageIdentity
Parameter Sets: Set1
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ReleaseToAll
The ReleaseToAll switch releases the quarantined message to all original recipients. You don't have to specify a value with this switch.

This parameter is required for the quarantine type SPOMalware.

If you previously used the User parameter or the ReleaseToAll switch to release the quarantined message to some or all of the original recipients, those recipients are skipped when you use the ReleaseToAll parameter again. You don't have to specify a value with the ReleaseToAll switch.

You can't use the ReleaseToAll switch and the User parameter in the same command.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Set3
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -User
The User parameter specifies the email address of the user to whom you want to release the quarantined message. You can specify multiple email addresses separated by commas.

You can use this parameter to release the message to recipients of the original message, or to any other email addresses in the organization.

If you previously used the ReleaseToAll switch to release the quarantined message to all original recipients, and you later release the message again with the User parameter, any original recipients you specify with the User parameter are skipped.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: Set4
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllowSender
The AllowSender switch specifies that all future messages from the sender won't be quarantined. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

If the message was quarantined because of a transport rule or blocked sender, messages from the sender can still be blocked in the future.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New and Set cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Delete
**This parameter has been deprecated and is no longer used.**

To delete quarantined messages, use the Delete-QuarantineMessage cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Set3
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
The Force switch specifies whether to attempt the re-release of previously released messages from quarantine. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

You need to use this switch whenever you attempt to re-release previously released messages from quarantine.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ReportFalsePositive
The ReportFalsePositive switch sends a notification message indicating the specified message was not spam. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

This switch is only available for quarantined spam messages.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
