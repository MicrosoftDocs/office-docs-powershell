parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

description: |-
  When a message queue is drained, the active messages in the queues on the source Mailbox server are routed to the target Mailbox server. After the messages are received and queued by the target Mailbox server, the messages are made redundant. Other considerations include the following:

  - Only active messages are drained. Shadow queues aren't drained.
  - Messages in the poison message queue aren't drained.
  - The source server won't accept new messages while the queues are drained.
