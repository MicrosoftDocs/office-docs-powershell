Use the Get-ActiveSyncDeviceClass cmdlet to retrieve a list of ActiveSync devices that have connected to your organization. The cmdlet returns the mobile device type and model information.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-ActiveSyncDeviceClass [[-Identity] <ActiveSyncDeviceClassIdParameter>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Filter <String>] [-SortBy <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You can use this cmdlet to view a list of mobile phones or devices by type. For example, you can return a list of all Android mobile digital devices in the organization or all Windows Phone devices in the organization.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-ActiveSyncDeviceClass -Filter {DeviceType -eq "WP"}
```

This example returns a list of all Windows Phones.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-ActiveSyncDeviceClass | group-object -property DeviceType
```

This example lists all device types within the organization along with a count of the number of devices of each type present.

## PARAMETERS

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter
The Filter parameter uses OPATH filter syntax to filter the results by the specified properties and values. The search criteria uses the syntax {\<Property\> -\<Comparison operator\> '\<Value\>'}.

- \<Property\> is a filterable property.

- -\<Comparison Operator\> is an OPATH comparison operator. For example -eq for equals and -like for string comparison. For more information about comparison operators, see about\_Comparison\_Operators (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=620712).

- \<Value\> is the property value. Text values with or without spaces need to be enclosed in quotation marks ('\<Value\>'). Don't use quotation marks with integers or the system values $true, $false, or $null.

You can chain multiple search criteria together using the logical operators -and and -or. For example, {\<Criteria1\>) -and \<Criteria2\>} or {(\<Criteria1\> -and \<Criteria2\>) -or \<Criteria3\>}.

You can filter by the following properties:

- DeviceModel

- DeviceType

- LastUpdateTime

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the ActiveSync device class that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the ActiveSync device class. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

```yaml
Type: ActiveSyncDeviceClassIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SortBy
The SortBy parameter specifies the property to sort the results by. You can sort by only one property at a time. The results are sorted in ascending order.

If the default view doesn't include the property you're sorting by, you can append the command with | Format-Table -Auto \<Property1\>,\<Property2\>... to create a new view that contains all of the properties that you want to see. Wildcards (\*) in the property names are supported.

You can sort by the following properties:

- DeviceModel

- DeviceType

- LastUpdateTime

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
