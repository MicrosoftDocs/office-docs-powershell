  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowAccessForUnSupportedPlatform
  description: |+
    This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowRMSSupportForUnenlightenedApps
  description: |+
    This parameter is functional only in the cloud-based service.

    The AllowRMSSupportForUnenlightenedApps parameter specifies whether to allow Rights Management Services (RMS) protected messages for ActiveSync clients that don't support RMS. Valid values are:

    - $true
    - $false (This is the default value)

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
