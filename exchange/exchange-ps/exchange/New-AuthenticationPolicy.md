# New-AuthenticationPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the New-AuthenticationPolicy cmdlet to create authentication policies in your organization.

**Note**: We recommend that you use the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. For instructions, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
New-AuthenticationPolicy -Name "Engineering Group" -AllowBasicAuthImap
```

In Exchange Online, this example creates a new authentication policy named Engineering Group that allows Basic authentication with IMAP.

### Example 2
```powershell
New-AuthenticationPolicy -Name "Research and Development Group" -BlockLegacyAuthActiveSync -BlockLegacyAuthAutodiscover -BlockLegacyAuthImap -BlockLegacyAuthMapi -BlockLegacyAuthOfflineAddressBook -BlockLegacyAuthPop -BlockLegacyAuthRpc -BlockLegacyAuthWebServices
```

In Exchange 2019, this example creates a new authentication policy named Research and Development Group that blocks legacy authentication for the specified protocols.

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

Type: SwitchParameter

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
