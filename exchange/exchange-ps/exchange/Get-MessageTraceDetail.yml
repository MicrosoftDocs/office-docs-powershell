parameters:
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Action
  description: |+
    The Action parameter filters the report by the action taken on messages. To view the complete list of valid values for this parameter, run the command: `Get-MailFilterListReport -SelectionTarget Actions`. The action you specify must correspond to the report type. For example, you can only specify malware filter actions for malware reports.

    You can specify multiple values separated by commas.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EndDate
  description: |+
    The EndDate parameter specifies the end date of the date range.

    Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

    If don't use the StartDate and EndDate parameters, only data from the last 48 hours is returned.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Event
  description: |+
    The Event parameter filters the report by the message event. The following are examples of common events:

    - RECEIVE: The message was received by the service.
    - SEND: The message was sent by the service.
    - FAIL: The message failed to be delivered.
    - DELIVER: The message was delivered to a mailbox.
    - EXPAND: The message was sent to a distribution group that was expanded.
    - TRANSFER: Recipients were moved to a bifurcated message because of content conversion, message recipient limits, or agents.

  name: MessageId
  description: |+
    The MessageId parameter filters the results by the Message-ID header field of the message. This value is also known as the Client ID. The format of the Message-ID depends on the messaging server that sent the message. The value should be unique for each message. However, not all messaging servers create values for the Message-ID in the same way. Be sure to include the full Message ID string (which may include angle brackets) and enclose the value in quotation marks (for example, "<d9683b4c-127b-413a-ae2e-fa7dfb32c69d@DM3NAM06BG401.Eop-nam06.prod.protection.outlook.com>").

  name: MessageTraceId
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The MessageTraceId parameter filters the results by the message trace ID value of the message. This GUID value is generated for every message that's processed by the system (for example, c20e0f7a-f06b-41df-fe33-08d9da155ac1).

    The MessageTraceId value is also available in the output of the following cmdlets:

    - Get-MailDetailATPReport
    - Get-MailDetailDlpPolicyReport
    - Get-MailDetailEncryptionReport
    - Get-MailDetailTransportRuleReport
