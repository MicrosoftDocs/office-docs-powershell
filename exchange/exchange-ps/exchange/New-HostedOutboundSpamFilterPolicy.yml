    The ActionWhenThresholdReach parameter specifies the action to take when any of the limits specified in the policy are reached. Valid values are:

    - Alert: No action, alert only.
    - BlockUser: Prevent the user from sending email messages.
    - BlockUserForToday: Prevent the user from sending email messages until the following day. This is the default value.

- type: <xref href="AutoForwardingMode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AutoForwardingMode
  description: |+
    The AutoForwardingMode specifies how the policy controls automatic email forwarding to external recipients. Valid values are:

    - Automatic: This is the default value. This setting is now the same as Off. When this setting was originally introduced, this value was equivalent to On. Over time, thanks to the principles of [secure by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/secure-by-default), this value was gradually changed to the equivalent of Off for all customers. For more information, see [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-automatic-email-forwarding-in/ba-p/2074888).
    - On: Automatic external email forwarding is not restricted.
    - Off: Automatic external email forwarding is disabled and will result in a non-delivery report (also known as an NDR or bounce message) to the sender.

    This setting applies only to cloud-based mailboxes, and automatic forwarding to internal recipients is not affected by this setting.

  New policies that you create using this cmdlet aren't applied to users and aren't visible in admin centers. You need to use the HostedOutboundSpamFilterPolicy parameter on the New-HostedOutboundSpamFilterRule or Set-HostedOutboundSpamFilterRule cmdlets to associate the policy with a rule.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you.
