## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Get-HotmailSubscription cmdlet to view information about Hotmail subscriptions configured in cloud-based mailboxes.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-HotmailSubscription [[-Identity] <AggregationSubscriptionIdParameter>]
 [-AggregationType <Aggregation | Mirrored | Migration | PeopleConnection | All>] [-Confirm] [-IncludeReport]
 [-Mailbox <MailboxIdParameter>] [-ResultSize <Unlimited>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You can view the properties of the Hotmail subscription, such as the connection status and the last time a successful synchronization occurred.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-HotmailSubscription -Mailbox "Kim Akers" -IncludeReport | Export-CSV C:\KimAkersHotmailReport
```

This example returns additional information about the Hotmail subscriptions configured in the mailbox of the user Kim Akers.

## PARAMETERS

### -AggregationType
The AggregationType parameter filters the results by type. The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- All

- Aggregation

- Migration

- Mirrored

- PeopleConnection

```yaml
Type: Aggregation | Mirrored | Migration | PeopleConnection | All
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the Hotmail subscription. You can identify the subscription by using one of the following methods:

- Specify the globally unique identifier of the subscription, which is its canonical name (CN).

- Use the Mailbox parameter to specify the mailbox that contains the subscription, and then specify the name of the subscription.

You can find the identifying values for a Hotmail subscription, such as Identity and Name, by running this command: Get-HotmailSubscription -Mailbox \<mailbox\>.

```yaml
Type: AggregationSubscriptionIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IncludeReport
The IncludeReport switch specifies whether to return additional details, which can be used for troubleshooting.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Mailbox
The Mailbox parameter specifies the cloud-based mailbox that contains the Hotmail subscription. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

- Name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- \<domain name\>\\\<account name\>

- Email address

- GUID

- LegacyExchangeDN

- SamAccountName

- User ID or user principal name (UPN)

```yaml
Type: MailboxIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResultSize
The ResultSize parameter specifies the total number of subscriptions to return. If no value is specified, the parameter returns all results that match the filter.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
