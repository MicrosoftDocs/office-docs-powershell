# Get-SendAddress

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Get-SendAddress cmdlet to view the email addresses on a user's mailbox that can be configured as the default From address. This cmdlet is primarily used by the Outlook on the web \> Options \> Connected Accounts user interface. Typically, you don't need to run this cmdlet.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

### LookUpId
```
Get-SendAddress [-AddressId <String>] [-Mailbox <MailboxIdParameter>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Identity
```
Get-SendAddress [[-Identity] <SendAddressIdParameter>] [-Mailbox <MailboxIdParameter>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Configuring a default From address only makes sense if the user has POP, IMAP, or Hotmail subscriptions configured on the mailbox. If you don't specify a value for the default From address, the default behavior is:

- The primary email address on the user's mailbox is used for all new messages.

- The To address of the incoming message is used as the From address for all replies or forwarded messages.

The only email addresses that can be configured as the default From address are:

- The user's primary email address.

- The email addresses of a user's POP, IMAP, or Hotmail subscription.

You set the user's default From address in the SendAddressDefault parameter on the Set-MailboxMessageConfiguration cmdlet. Users can override the default From address when they create an email message in Outlook on the web.

The Get-SendAddress and Set-MailboxMessageConfiguration cmdlets represent the email addresses of POP, IMAP, or Hotmail subscriptions as a GUID. It's easier to configure a user's default From address in Outlook on the web \> Options \> Account \> Connected Accounts.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
