### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in Security & Compliance PowerShell. For more information, see [Security & Compliance PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/scc-powershell).

  Use the New-OrganizationSegment cmdlet to create organization segments for use with information barrier policies in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. Organization Segments are not in effect until you [apply information barrier policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/information-barriers-policies#step-4-apply-ib-policies).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    New-OrganizationSegment -Name "HR" -UserGroupFilter "Department -eq 'HR'"
  description: |-
    In this example, a segment called HR is defined using HR, a value in the Department attribute.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    New-OrganizationSegment -Name "NotSales" -UserGroupFilter "Department -ne 'Sales'"
  description: |-
    In this example, we defined a segment called NotSales that includes everyone who is not in Sales. The "-ne" portion of the cmdlet refers to "not equals."
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    New-OrganizationSegment -Name "LocalFTE" -UserGroupFilter "Location -eq 'Local' -and Position -ne 'Temporary'"
  description: |-
    In this example, we defined a segment called LocalFTE that includes people who are locally located and whose positions are not listed as Temporary.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies the unique name for the organization segment. The maximum length is 64 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UserGroupFilter
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The UserGroupFilter parameter uses OPATH filter syntax to specify the members of the organization segment. The syntax is `"Property -ComparisonOperator 'Value'"` (for example, `"MemberOf -eq 'Engineering Department'"` or `"ExtensionAttribute1 -eq 'DayTrader'"`).

    - Enclose the whole OPATH filter in double quotation marks " ". If the filter contains system values (for example, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null`), use single quotation marks ' ' instead. Although this parameter is a string (not a system block), you can also use braces { }, but only if the filter doesn't contain variables.
    - Property is a filterable property. For more information, see [Attributes for information barrier policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/information-barriers-attributes).
    - ComparisonOperator is an OPATH comparison operator (for example `-eq` for equals and `-like` for string comparison). For more information about comparison operators, see [about_Comparison_Operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comparison_operators).
    - Value is the property value to search for. Enclose text values and variables in single quotation marks (`'Value'` or `'$Variable'`). If a variable value contains single quotation marks, you need to identify (escape) the single quotation marks to expand the variable correctly. For example, instead of `'$User'`, use `'$($User -Replace "'","''")'`. Don't enclose integers or system values in quotation marks (for example, use `500`, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null` instead).

    For detailed information about OPATH filters in Exchange, see [Additional OPATH syntax information](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/recipient-filters#additional-opath-syntax-information).

    Use the same property for all of your segments, and verify that your segments don't overlap (a user must be assigned to only one segment).
