parameters:
- type: <xref href="UMSmartHost" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Address
  description: |+
    The Address parameter specifies the IP address or the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) configured on the UM IP gateway or SIP-enabled IP PBX. An FQDN is required if the UM dial plan associated with the UM IP gateway is operating in SIP Secured or Secured mode. If an FQDN is used, verify that the Domain Name System (DNS) has been configured correctly.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Set-UMIPGateway
name: Set-UMIPGateway
description: |-
  The Set-UMIPGateway cmdlet modifies configuration settings for a specific UM IP gateway, for example, the IP address to the IP gateway. These modifications include allowing outgoing calls and controlling communications with a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-enabled IP Private Branch eXchange (PBX) or IP gateway.

  It's possible that modifications to the UM IP gateway settings may disrupt communication between Mailbox servers and the SIP-enabled IP PBX or IP gateway. Modifications to a UM IP gateway should be performed only by an administrator who fully understands the implications of making configuration changes to the UM IP gateway.

  After this task is completed, the parameters and values specified are configured on the UM IP gateway.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
