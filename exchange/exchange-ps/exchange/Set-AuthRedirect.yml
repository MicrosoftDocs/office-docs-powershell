  code: |-
    Set-AuthRedirect -Identity AuthRedirect-Bearer-C0B7AC3F-FE64-4B4B-A907-9226F8027CCE -TargetUrl https://mbx01.contoso.com
  description: |-
    This example sets the TargetURL value to `https://mbx01.contoso.com` for the existing OAuth redirection object named `AuthRedirect-Bearer-C0B7AC3F-FE64-4B4B-A907-9226F8027CCE`.

- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Get-AuthRedirect | Set-AuthRedirect -TargetUrl https://mbx01.contoso.com
  description: |-
    This example sets the TargetURL value for all existing OAuth redirection objects in your organization. However, if you have only one object in your organization, this example has the same result as the first example.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the existing OAuth redirection object that you want to modify. The object name uses the syntax `AuthRedirect-Bearer-GUID`. The easiest way to find the name of the OAuth redirection object is to run Get-AuthRedirect.
