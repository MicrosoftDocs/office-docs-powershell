## SYNTAX

```
Get-EdgeSubscription [[-Identity] <TransportServerIdParameter>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Run the Get-EdgeSubscription cmdlet on an Exchange server in your organization. This cmdlet retrieves the list of Edge Subscriptions. Each Edge Transport server that's subscribed to the Exchange organization has a separate Edge Subscription. You can use this cmdlet to view the Edge Subscription information for a specific Edge Transport server. You can also use this cmdlet to view the Edge Subscription information for all Edge Transport servers subscribed to Active Directory sites.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-EdgeSubscription | Format-List
```

This example retrieves detailed Edge Subscription information for all Edge Transport servers subscribed to your Exchange organization.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-EdgeSubscription Edge1 -DomainController DC1.contoso.com
```

This example retrieves the Edge Subscription information for the Edge Transport server name Edge1 from the domain controller named DC1.

## PARAMETERS

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.
