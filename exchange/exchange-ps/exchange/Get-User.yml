  name: Arbitration
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The Arbitration switch is required to return arbitration mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    Arbitration mailboxes are system mailboxes that are used for storing different types of system data and for managing messaging approval workflow.

    To return arbitration mailboxes that are used to store audit log settings or data, don't use this switch. Instead, use the AuditLog or AuxAuditLog switches.

- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.

    A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    The Filter parameter uses OPATH syntax to filter the results by the specified properties and values. The search criteria uses the syntax `"Property -ComparisonOperator 'Value'"`.

    - Enclose the whole OPATH filter in double quotation marks " ". If the filter contains system values (for example, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null`), use single quotation marks ' ' instead. Although this parameter is a string (not a system block), you can also use braces { }, but only if the filter doesn't contain variables.
    - Property is a filterable property. For more information about the filterable properties in Exchange server and Exchange Online, see [Filterable properties for the Filter parameter](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/filter-properties).
    - ComparisonOperator is an OPATH comparison operator (for example `-eq` for equals and `-like` for string comparison). For more information about comparison operators, see [about_Comparison_Operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comparison_operators).
    - Value is the property value to search for. Enclose text values and variables in single quotation marks (`'Value'` or `'$Variable'`). If a variable value contains single quotation marks, you need to identify (escape) the single quotation marks to expand the variable correctly. For example, instead of `'$User'`, use `'$($User -Replace "'","''")'`. Don't enclose integers or system values in quotation marks (for example, use `500`, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null` instead).

    You can chain multiple search criteria together using the logical operators `-and` and `-or`. For example, `"Criteria1 -and Criteria2"` or `"(Criteria1 -and Criteria2) -or Criteria3"`.

    For detailed information about OPATH filters in Exchange, see [Additional OPATH syntax information](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/recipient-filters#additional-opath-syntax-information).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UserIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter the user that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the user. For example:

    - Name
    - User principal name (UPN)
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnoreDefaultScope
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange PowerShell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch enables the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope, but also introduces the following restrictions:

    - You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.
    - You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  name: IsVIP
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The IsVIP switch filters the results by priority accounts. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    For more information about priority accounts, see [Manage and monitor priority accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/setup/priority-accounts).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="OrganizationalUnitIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: OrganizationalUnit
  description: |+
    The OrganizationalUnit parameter filters the results based on the object's location in Active Directory. Only objects that exist in the specified location are returned. Valid input for this parameter is an organizational unit (OU) or domain that's returned by the Get-OrganizationalUnit cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OU or domain. For example:

    - Name
    - Canonical name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PublicFolder
  description: |+
    The PublicFolder switch is required to return public folder mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    Public folder mailboxes are specially designed mailboxes that store the hierarchy and content of public folders.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReadFromDomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The ReadFromDomainController switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    The command: `Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true` to include all objects in the forest requires the ReadFromDomainController switch. Otherwise, the command might use a global catalog that contains outdated information. Also, you might need to run multiple iterations of the command with the ReadFromDomainController switch to get the information.

    By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Get-User
name: Get-User
description: |-
  The Get-User cmdlet returns no mail-related properties for mailboxes or mail users. To view the mail-related properties for a user, you need to use the corresponding cmdlet based on the object type (for example, Get-Mailbox or Get-MailUser).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
