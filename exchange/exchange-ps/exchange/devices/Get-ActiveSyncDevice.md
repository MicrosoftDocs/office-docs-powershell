# Get-ActiveSyncDevice

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-ActiveSyncDevice cmdlet to retrieve the list of devices in your organization that have active Exchange ActiveSync partnerships.

Note: In Exchange 2013 or later, use the Get-MobileDevice cmdlet instead. If you have scripts that use Get-ActiveSyncDevice, update them to use Get-MobileDevice.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

 [-SortBy <String>] [-Monitoring] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Identity
```
Get-ActiveSyncDevice [[-Identity] <ActiveSyncDeviceIdParameter>]

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-ActiveSyncDevice cmdlet returns identification, configuration and status information for each device.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-ActiveSyncDevice -Identity "TonySmith"
```

This example returns all the Exchange ActiveSync mobile devices that Tony Smith has used that are associated with his mailbox.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-ActiveSyncDevice -Mailbox "Redmond\TonySmith"
```

This example returns all the Exchange ActiveSync mobile devices that Tony Smith has used that are associated with his mailbox.

## PARAMETERS

### -Mailbox
The Mailbox parameter specifies the mailbox that has the associated ActiveSync device that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

- Name

- Alias

- Distinguished name (DN)

- Canonical DN

- \<domain name\>\\\<account name\>

- Email address

- GUID

- LegacyExchangeDN

- SamAccountName

- User ID or user principal name (UPN)

```yaml
Type: MailboxIdParameter
Parameter Sets: Mailbox
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter
The Filter parameter uses OPATH filter syntax to filter the results by the specified properties and values. The search criteria uses the syntax {\<Property\> -\<Comparison operator\> '\<Value\>'}.

- \<Property\> is a filterable property.

- -\<Comparison Operator\> is an OPATH comparison operator. For example -eq for equals and -like for string comparison. For more information about comparison operators, see about\_Comparison\_Operators (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=620712).

- \<Value\> is the property value. Text values with or without spaces need to be enclosed in quotation marks ('\<Value\>'). Don't use quotation marks with integers or the system values $true, $false, or $null.

You can chain multiple search criteria together using the logical operators -and and -or. For example, {\<Criteria1\>) -and \<Criteria2\>} or {(\<Criteria1\> -and \<Criteria2\>) -or \<Criteria3\>}.

You can filter by the following properties:

- ClientType

- DeviceAccessControlRule

- DeviceAccessState

- DeviceAccessStateReason

- DeviceActiveSyncVersion

- DeviceId

- DeviceImei

- DeviceMobileOperator

- DeviceModel

- DeviceOS

- DeviceOSLanguage

- DeviceTelephoneNumber

- DeviceType

- DeviceUserAgent

- FirstSyncTime

- FriendlyName

- ProvisioningFlags

- UserDisplayName

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the ActiveSync device that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the device. For example:

- GUID

- DeviceIdentity

- Multi-TenantID

```yaml
Type: ActiveSyncDeviceIdParameter
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Monitoring
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The Monitoring switch is required to return monitoring mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

Monitoring mailboxes are associated with managed availability and the Exchange Health Manager service, and have a RecipientTypeDetails property value of MonitoringMailbox.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named

```

### -OrganizationalUnit
The OrganizationalUnit parameter filters the results based on the object's location in Active Directory. Only objects that exist in the specified location are returned. Valid input for this parameter is an organizational unit (OU) or domain that's visible using the Get-OrganizationalUnit cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OU or domain. For example:

- Name

- Canonical name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

```yaml
Type: OrganizationalUnitIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResultSize
The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SortBy
The SortBy parameter specifies the property to sort the results by. You can sort by only one property at a time. The results are sorted in ascending order.

If the default view doesn't include the property you're sorting by, you can append the command with | Format-Table -Auto \<Property1\>,\<Property2\>... to create a new view that contains all of the properties that you want to see. Wildcards (\*) in the property names are supported.

You can sort by the following properties:

- DeviceAccessControlRule

- DeviceAccessState

- DeviceAccessStateReason

- DeviceId

- DeviceImei

- DeviceMobileOperator

- DeviceModel

- DeviceOS

- DeviceOSLanguage

- DeviceTelephoneNumber

- DeviceType

- DeviceUserAgent

- FirstSyncTime

- FriendlyName

- UserDisplayName

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
