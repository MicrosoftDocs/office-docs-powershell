# Remove-DeviceConfigurationPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center. For more information, see Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt587091.aspx).

Use the Remove-DeviceConfigurationPolicy cmdlet to remove mobile device configuration policies from the Security & Compliance Center.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-DeviceConfigurationPolicy [-Identity] <PolicyIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
These are the cmdlets that are used for mobile device management in the Security & Compliance Center:

- DeviceTenantPolicy and DeviceTenantRule cmdlets: A policy that defines whether to block or allow mobile device access to Office 365 email by unsupported devices that use Exchange ActiveSync only. This setting applies to all users in your organization. Both allow and block scenarios allow reporting for unsupported devices, and you can specify exceptions to the policy based on security groups.

- DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy and DeviceConditionalAccessRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device access to Office 365 for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups. Unsupported devices are not allowed to enroll in mobile device management.

- DeviceConfigurationPolicy and DeviceConfigurationRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device settings for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups.

- Get-DevicePolicy: Returns all mobile device management policies regardless of type (DeviceTenantPolicy, DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy or DeviceConfigurationPolicy).

You need to be assigned permissions in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center before you can use this cmdlet. For more information, see Permissions in Office 365 Security & Compliance Center (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=511920).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
Remove-DeviceConfigurationPolicy -Identity "Engineering Group"
```

This example removes the mobile device configuration policy named Engineering Group.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the mobile device configuration policy that you want to remove. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

```yaml
Type: PolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch doesn't work in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center.
