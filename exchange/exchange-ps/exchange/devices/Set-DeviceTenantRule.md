# Set-DeviceTenantRule

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center. For more information, see Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt587091.aspx).

Use the Set-DeviceTenantRule cmdlet to modify your organization's mobile device tenant rule in the Security & Compliance Center.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-DeviceTenantRule [-Identity] <ComplianceRuleIdParameter>
 [-ApplyPolicyTo <None | ExchangeOnline | SharepointOnline | ExchangeAndSharepoint>]
 [-BlockUnsupportedDevices <$true | $false>] [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-ExclusionList <MultiValuedProperty>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
These are the cmdlets that are used for mobile device management in the Security & Compliance Center:

- DeviceTenantPolicy and DeviceTenantRule cmdlets: A policy that defines whether to block or allow mobile device access to Office 365 email by unsupported devices that use Exchange ActiveSync only. This setting applies to all users in your organization. Both allow and block scenarios allow reporting for unsupported devices, and you can specify exceptions to the policy based on security groups.

- DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy and DeviceConditionalAccessRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device access to Office 365 for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups. Unsupported devices are not allowed to enroll in mobile device management.

- DeviceConfigurationPolicy and DeviceConfigurationRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device settings for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups.

- Get-DevicePolicy: Returns all mobile device management policies regardless of type (DeviceTenantPolicy, DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy or DeviceConfigurationPolicy).

You need to be assigned permissions in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center before you can use this cmdlet. For more information, see Permissions in Office 365 Security & Compliance Center (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=511920).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
Set-DeviceTenantRule -ExclusionList "Research and Development"
```

This example modifies your organization's mobile device tenant rule by replacing the current exclusion list with the security group named Research and Development. Members of this group are allowed access even if they use non-compliant devices.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the name of the mobile device tenant rule that you want to modify, but there's only one in your organization. The name of the rule is a GUID. For example, 7577c5f3-05a4-4f55-a0a3-82aab5e98c84. You can find the name value by running the command Get-DeviceTenantRule | Format-List Name.

```yaml
Type: ComplianceRuleIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ApplyPolicyTo
The ApplyPolicyTo parameter specifies where to apply the policy in your organization. Valid values for this parameter are:

- ExchangeOnline

- SharePointOnline

- ExchangeAndSharePoint

```yaml
Type: None | ExchangeOnline | SharepointOnline | ExchangeAndSharepoint
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BlockUnsupportedDevices
The BlockUnsupportedDevices parameter specifies whether to block access to your organization by unsupported devices. Valid values for this parameter are:

- $true: Unsupported devices are blocked.

- $false: Unsupported devices are allowed.

```yaml
Type: $true | $false
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExclusionList
The ExclusionList parameter specifies the security groups to exclude from this policy. Members of the specified security groups who have non-compliant devices are not affected by block access actions.

This parameter uses the GUID value of the group. To find this GUID value, run the command Get-Group | Format-Table Name,GUID.

To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: \<value1\>,\<value2\>,...\<valueN\>. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, you need to use the following syntax: "\<value1\>","\<value2\>",..."\<valueN\">.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch doesn't work in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center.

```yaml

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
