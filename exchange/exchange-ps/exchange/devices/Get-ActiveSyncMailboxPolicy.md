# Get-ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy cmdlet to retrieve the Mobile Device mailbox policy settings for a specific Mobile Device mailbox policy.

The Get-ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy cmdlet will be removed in a future version of Microsoft Exchange. Use the Get-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy cmdlet instead. If you have any scripts that use the Get-ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy cmdlet, update them to use the Get-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy cmdlet.
