## DESCRIPTION
These are the cmdlets that are used for mobile device management in the Security & Compliance Center:

- DeviceTenantPolicy and DeviceTenantRule cmdlets: A policy that defines whether to block or allow mobile device access to Office 365 email by unsupported devices that use Exchange ActiveSync only. This setting applies to all users in your organization. Both allow and block scenarios allow reporting for unsupported devices, and you can specify exceptions to the policy based on security groups.

- DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy and DeviceConditionalAccessRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device access to Office 365 for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups. Unsupported devices are not allowed to enroll in mobile device management.

- DeviceConfigurationPolicy and DeviceConfigurationRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device settings for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups.

- Get-DevicePolicy: Returns all mobile device management policies regardless of type (DeviceTenantPolicy, DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy or DeviceConfigurationPolicy).

You need to be assigned permissions in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center before you can use this cmdlet. For more information, see Permissions in Office 365 Security & Compliance Center (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=511920).
