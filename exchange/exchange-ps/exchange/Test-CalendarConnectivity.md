# Test-CalendarConnectivity

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Test-CalendarConnectivity cmdlet to verify that anonymous calendar sharing is enabled and working properly. The Calendar virtual directory is a subdirectory of the Microsoft Outlook on the web virtual directories. When you run this command without any parameters, the command tests calendar connectivity against all Outlook on the web virtual directories.

**Note**: This cmdlet works best in Exchange 2010. In Exchange 2013 or later, the functionality of this cmdlet has been replaced by Managed Availability. For the best results, use the Invoke-MonitoringProbe cmdlet and specify the relevant active monitor probe instead of using this cmdlet.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Test-CalendarConnectivity [[-ClientAccessServer] <ServerIdParameter>] [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-LightMode] [-MailboxServer <ServerIdParameter>] [-MonitoringContext] [-ResetTestAccountCredentials]
 [-TestType <OwaConnectivityTestType>] [-Timeout <UInt32>] [-TrustAnySSLCertificate]
 [-VirtualDirectoryName <String>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Test-CalendarConnectivity cmdlet tests anonymous calendar sharing by connecting to a specified Outlook on the web virtual directory, to any Outlook on the web virtual directories on a specified Exchange server, or to any Outlook on the web virtual directories that are available in the local Active Directory site.

The first time you use this cmdlet, you might be required to create a test user. To create a test user, run the following command:

& $env:ExchangeInstallPath\Scripts\New-TestCasConnectivityUser.ps1

If the server hosting the test mailbox isn't available, the command returns an error that might not clearly identify the problem. To avoid this, use the Test-MapiConnectivity cmdlet to verify that the server that hosts the test mailbox is running and that the mailbox is available before you run this command.

The test results are displayed on-screen. The cmdlet returns the following information.

- CasServer: The Exchange server that the client connected to.

- LocalSite: The name of the local Active Directory site.

- Scenario: The operations that are tested. Values are: Logon, CalendarICS and CalendarHTML.

- Result: The values returned are typically Success, Skipped or Failure.

- Latency(MS): The time required to complete the test in milliseconds.

- Error: Any error messages that were encountered.

You can write the results to a file by piping the output to ConvertTo-Html or ConvertTo-Csv and adding \> \<filename\> to the command. For example:

Test-CalendarConnectivity -ClientAccessServer MBX01 | ConvertTo-Html | Set-Content -Path "C:\\My Documents\\Calendar Test.html"

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Test-CalendarConnectivity -ClientAccessServer MBX01
```

This example tests the anonymous calendar sharing for the server named MBX01.

## PARAMETERS

### -ClientAccessServer
The ClientAccessServer parameter specifies the Exchange server to test. This server has the Client Access server role installed, and is responsible for accepting client connections.

You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- ExchangeLegacyDN

- GUID

```yaml
Type: ServerIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LightMode
This parameter isn't implemented for this diagnostic command. Using this parameter doesn't change the behavior of this command.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MailboxServer
The MailboxServer parameter specifies the Exchange 2016 or Exchange 2013 Mailbox server that you want to test. This parameter identifies the backend server that accepts proxied connections from the frontend server where clients connect.

You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- ExchangeLegacyDN

- GUID

If you don't use this parameter, connections to all Mailbox servers in the local Active Directory site are tested.

```yaml
Type: ServerIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
