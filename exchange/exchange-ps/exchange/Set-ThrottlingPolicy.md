## DESCRIPTION
Throttling policy settings are stored in Active Directory.

By default, there is one default user throttling policy named GlobalThrottlingPolicy with a throttling scope of Global. Microsoft Setup creates this policy as part of the Client Access server role. You shouldn't replace, re-create, or remove the existing default throttling policy. However, you can edit any additional throttling policies with the scope of Organization or Regular if you want to change your user throttling settings. You can create polices with the scope of Organization or Regular using the New-ThrottlingPolicy cmdlet.

For more information about how to control the resources consumed by individual users, see [User workload management in Exchange Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/server-health/workload-management).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
$a = Get-ThrottlingPolicy RemoteSiteUserPolicy; $a | Set-ThrottlingPolicy -EwsMaxConcurrency 4
```

This example modifies a throttling policy so that users associated with this policy can have a maximum of four concurrent requests running in Exchange Web Services.

### Example 2
```powershell
Set-ThrottlingPolicy RemoteSiteUserPolicy -PowerShellMaxConcurrency 3 -PowerShellMaxCmdletQueueDepth 12
```

This example modifies a throttling policy so that it restricts the number of connections for a user to three. The users associated with this policy are only able to create three Exchange Management Shell sessions. This policy also restricts to three the number of Exchange admin center operations or Exchange Web Services operations that can be executed at the same time. In addition, the PowerShellMaxCmdletQueueDepth parameter specifies that 12 operations maximum are allowed to be executed by the user.

### Example 3
```powershell
Set-ThrottlingPolicy <ThrottlingPolicyName> -PowerShellMaxDestructiveCmdlets 10 -PowerShellMaxDestructiveCmdletsTimePeriod 60
```

This example modifies a throttling policy so that it restricts a user to be able to execute only 10 destructive cmdlets in 60 seconds. If the users associated with this policy exceed this number, the cmdlet pipeline execution is stopped with a throttling error message. The user needs to wait for, and then resubmit the execution of cmdlets on the open connection.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter uniquely identifies the throttling policy that you want to modify values for. The name you use is the name of the throttling policy object in Active Directory.

```yaml
Type: ThrottlingPolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AnonymousCutoffBalance
The AnonymousCutoffBalance parameter specifies the resource consumption limits for an anonymous user before the user is completely blocked from performing operations on a specific component after all available resources have been consumed. There is no preset default value for this parameter but it generally ranges from 600,000 to 3,000,000 in working state depending on the protocol. If for any reason, this value needs to be increased further, you must contact Microsoft Support because a higher value can affect server performance adversely.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AnonymousMaxBurst
The AnonymousMaxBurst parameter specifies the amount of time that an anonymous user can consume an elevated amount of resources before being throttled. This is measured in milliseconds. This value is set separately for each component.

```yaml

### -AnonymousMaxConcurrency
The AnonymousMaxConcurrency parameter specifies how many anonymous connections can be made to a user's calendar data at the same time. A connection is held from the moment a request is received until a response is sent in its entirety to the requestor. If anonymous users attempt to make more concurrent requests than their policy allows, the new connection attempt fails. However, the existing connections remain valid. The AnonymousMaxConcurrency parameter has a valid range from 0 through 2147483647 inclusive. The default value is 1. To indicate that the number of concurrent connections should be unthrottled (no limit), this value should be set to $null.

```

### -AnonymousPercentTimeInMailboxRPC
This parameter is available or functional only in Exchange Server 2010.

The AnonymousPercentTimeInMailboxRPC parameter specifies the percentage of a minute that anonymous users can spend executing mailbox RPC requests (PercentTimeInMailboxRPC) to a user's calendar data. A value of 100 indicates that for every one-minute window, the user can spend 60 seconds of that time consuming the resource in question.

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

The IsServiceAccount switch specifies whether you want the user accounts associated with this policy to be moderated by the per-user thresholds specified by this policy, and also by additional throttling based on the health of system resources, such as overall CPU usage.

This value is set to $false by default.

You may want to set this value to $true if you intend to associate this policy with user accounts that require higher throttling limits. An account that might require higher throttling limits is a service account that performs a lot of non-interactive work (for example, service accounts that perform IMAP mailbox migrations or nightly Windows PowerShell tasks).

By setting the IsServiceAccount switch to $true, work done by these accounts is moderated by the higher user throttling settings that you configure using the user throttling policy, but is slowed if resources start getting unhealthy.

Throttling these cmdlets may help prevent accidental data loss. The following cmdlets are designated as destructive:

- Disable-Mailbox

- Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase

- Remove-AcceptedDomain

- Remove-Mailbox

- Remove-MailUser

- Remove-Organization

By default, the limit for concurrent Windows PowerShell connections per tenant organization is set to 9. If users in a tenant organization try to make more concurrent requests than the limit set by the PowerShellMaxTenantConcurrency parameter, the new connection attempt fails. However, the existing connections remain valid. This limit is enforced even if a single user hasn't exceeded the per-user limit set by the PowerShellMaxConcurrency parameter. The PowerShellMaxTenantConcurrency parameter has a valid range from 0 through 100 inclusive. To indicate that the number of concurrent connections should be unthrottled (no limit), this value should be set to $null.
