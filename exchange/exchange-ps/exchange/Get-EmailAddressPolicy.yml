  name: IncludeMailboxSettingOnlyPolicy
  description: |+
    This parameter is functional only in Exchange Server 2010.

    The IncludeMailboxSettingOnlyPolicy switch retrieves Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 address policies that contain only mailbox management configuration. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 supports policies that contain only address policy settings and policies that contain address policy settings and mailbox management configuration. Exchange 2010 doesn't support policies that contain only mailbox management configuration, but Exchange 2003 policies that contain only mailbox management configuration are, by default, preserved and not upgraded.

    The attributes of address policies that contain only mailbox management configuration can't be modified in Exchange 2010. These policies can only be removed.
