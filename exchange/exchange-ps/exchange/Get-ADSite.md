# Get-AdSite

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Get-AdSite cmdlet to display configuration information about one or more Active Directory sites.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-AdSite [[-Identity] <AdSiteIdParameter>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Exchange uses Active Directory sites and the costs assigned to the Active Directory site links to make message routing decisions.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-AdSite Default-First-Site-Name
```

This example displays the configuration details for the Active Directory site named Default-First-Site-Name.

## PARAMETERS

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.
