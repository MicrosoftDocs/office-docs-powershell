parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comment
  description: |+
    The Comment parameter specifies an optional comment. If you specify a value that contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example: "This is an admin note".

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    The Enabled parameter specifies whether the policy is enabled or disabled. Valid values are:

    - $true: The policy is enabled. This is the default value.
    - $false: The policy is disabled.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExchangeLocation
  description: |+
    The ExchangeLocation parameter specifies the mailboxes to include in the policy. Valid values are:

    - A mailbox
    - A distribution group or mail-enabled security group (all mailboxes that are currently members of the group).

    To specify a mailbox or distribution group, you can use any value that uniquely identifies it. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

    If no mailboxes are specified, then no mailboxes are placed on hold.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SharePointLocation
  description: |+
    The SharePointLocation parameter specifies the SharePoint Online sites to include. You identify the site by its URL value, or you can use the value All to include all sites.

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

    SharePoint Online sites can't be added to the policy until they have been indexed. If no sites are specified, then no sites are placed on hold.
