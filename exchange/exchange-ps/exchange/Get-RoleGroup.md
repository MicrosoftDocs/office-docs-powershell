## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-RoleGroup [[-Identity] <RoleGroupIdParameter>]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Filter <String>]
 [-ReadFromDomainController]
 [-ResultSize <Unlimited>]
 [-ShowPartnerLinked]
 [-SortBy <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
For more information about role groups, see Understanding management role groups (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd638105.aspx).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-RoleGroup
```

This example retrieves a list of role groups.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-RoleGroup "Recipient Administrators" | Format-List
```

This example retrieves the details for the Recipient Administrators role group.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-RoleGroup -ReadFromDomainController
```

This example retrieves a list of role groups as seen by the domain controller closest to the user.

### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```
Get-RoleGroup -Filter { RoleGroupType -Eq "Linked" } | Format-Table Name, LinkedGroup
```

This example retrieves a list of all linked role groups and the Active Directory security identifier (SID) of the foreign universal security groups (USG) that are linked to each of them. You can then use the SIDs to find the USGs so you can modify their members.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the role group to retrieve. If the name of the role group contains spaces, enclose the name in quotation marks (").

If the Identity parameter isn't specified, all role groups are returned.

```yaml
Type: RoleGroupIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter
The Filter parameter specifies the property to be used to filter the role groups. Only the role groups that match the criteria you specify are returned.

You can filter on the LinkedGroup, ManagedBy, Members, Name, RoleGroupType and DisplayName properties. If you create a filter using the RoleGroupType property, the only values you can use in the filter are Standard and Linked.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ReadFromDomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The ReadFromDomainController switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you run the command Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true to include all objects in the forest and you don't use the ReadFromDomainController switch, it's possible that information will be read from a global catalog that has outdated information. When you use the ReadFromDomainController switch, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information. You don't have to specify a value with this switch.

By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResultSize
The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.

```yaml
Type: Unlimited
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ShowPartnerLinked
This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

This ShowPartnerLinked switch specifies whether to return built-in role groups that are of type PartnerRoleGroup. Role groups of this type are used in the cloud-based services to allow partner service providers to manage their customer organizations. These role groups can't be edited and are therefore not shown by default.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SortBy
The SortBy parameter specifies the property to sort the results by. You can sort by only one property at a time. The results are sorted in ascending order.

If the default view doesn't include the property you're sorting by, you can append the command with | Format-Table -Auto \<Property1\>,\<Property2\>... to create a new view that contains all of the properties that you want to see. Wildcards (\*) in the property names are supported.

You can sort by the following properties:

- Name

- DisplayName

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online, Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Exchange Online Protection
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
