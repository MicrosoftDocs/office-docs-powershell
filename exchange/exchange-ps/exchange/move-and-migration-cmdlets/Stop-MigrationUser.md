# Stop-MigrationUser

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Stop-MigrationUser cmdlet to stop the migration of a user in an existing migration batch.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Stop-MigrationUser [[-Identity] <MigrationUserIdParameter>] [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Partition <MailboxIdParameter>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
Stop-MigrationUser -Identity laura@contoso.com
```

This example stops the migration of the user laura@contoso.com.

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the email address of the user that's being migrated.

You can also identify the user by the GUID value in the MigrationUser property from the output of the Get-MigrationUser cmdlet. This identification method is useful if you accidentally submitted the same user in multiple batches.

```yaml
Type: MigrationUserIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

```yaml
Type: MailboxIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
