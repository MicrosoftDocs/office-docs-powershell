  description: |-
    This example creates a static scope retention policy named Regulation 567 Compliance for the Viva Engage user messages of Jennifer Petersen and Kitty Nakamura.

    After you create the retention policy, use the New-AppRetentionComplianceRule cmdlet to create a retention rule and assign it the retention policy to it.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AdaptiveScopeLocation
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The AdaptiveScopeLocation parameter specifies the adaptive scope location to include in the policy. You create adaptive scopes by using the New-AdaptiveScope cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the adaptive scope. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Applications
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Applications parameter specifies the applications to include in the policy and is relevant only for the following location parameters:

    - ExchangeLocation
    - ModernGroupLocation
    - AdaptiveScopeLocation

    This parameter uses the following syntax: `"LocationtType:App1,LocationType:App2,...LocationType:AppN` where LocationType is User or Group. For example, `"User:Exchange,User:OneDriveForBusiness,Group:Exchange,Group:SharePoint"` or `"User:MicrosoftTeams","User:VivaEngage"`.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comment
  description: |+
    The Comment parameter specifies an optional comment. If you specify a value that contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example: "This is an admin note".

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    The Enabled parameter enables or disables the policy. Valid values are:

    - $true: The policy is enabled. This is the default value.
    - $false: The policy is disabled.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExchangeLocation
  description: |+
    The ExchangeLocation parameter specifies the mailboxes to include in the policy. Valid values are:

    - A mailbox
    - A distribution group or mail-enabled security group (all mailboxes that are currently members of the group).
    - The value All for all mailboxes. You can only use this value by itself.

    To specify a mailbox or distribution group, you can use any value that uniquely identifies it. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Security & Compliance
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExchangeLocationException
  description: |+
    The ExchangeLocationException parameter specifies the mailboxes exclude from the policy when you use the value All for the ExchangeLocation parameter. Valid values are:

    - A mailbox
    - A distribution group or mail-enabled security group

    To specify a mailbox or distribution group, you can use any value that uniquely identifies it. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)

  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ModernGroupLocation
  description: |+
    The ModernGroupLocation parameter specifies the Microsoft 365 Groups to include in the policy. Valid values are:

    - A Microsoft 365 Group
    - The value All for all Microsoft 365 Groups. You can only use this value by itself.

    To identify the Microsoft 365 Group, you can use any value that uniquely identifies it. For example:

  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+

  name: PolicyRBACScopes
  description: |+
    The PolicyRBACScopes parameter specifies the administrative units to assign to the policy. A valid value is the Microsoft Entra ObjectID (GUID value) of the administrative unit. You can specify multiple values separated by commas.

    Administrative units are available only in Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2. You create and manage administrative units in Microsoft Graph PowerShell.

  name: RestrictiveRetention
  description: |+
    The RestrictiveRetention parameter specifies whether Preservation Lock is enabled for the policy. Valid values are:

    - $true: Preservation Lock is enabled for the policy. No one -- including an administrator -- can turn off the policy or make it less restrictive.
    - $false: Preservation Lock isn't enabled for the policy. This is the default value.

    After a policy has been locked, no one can turn off or disable it, or remove apps from the policy. The only ways that you can modify the policy are by adding apps to it, or extending its duration. A locked policy can be increased or extended, but it can't be reduced, disabled, or turned off.

    Therefore, before you lock a policy, it's critical that you understand your organization's compliance requirements, and that you don't lock a policy until you are certain that it's what you need.

description: |-
  \*-AppRetentionCompliance\* cmdlets are used for policies with adaptive policy scopes and all static policies that cover Teams private channels, Viva Engage chats, and Viva Engage community messages. Eventually, you'll use these cmdlets for most retention locations and policy types. The \*-RetentionCompliance\* cmdlets will continue to support Exchange and SharePoint locations primarily. For policies created with the \*-AppRetentionCompliance\* cmdlets, you can only set the list of included or excluded scopes for all included workloads, which means you'll likely need to create one policy per workload.

  To use this cmdlet in Security & Compliance PowerShell, you need to be assigned permissions. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions).
