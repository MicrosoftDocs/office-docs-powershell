parameters:
- type: <xref href="ComplianceSecurityFilterActionType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Action
  description: |+
    The Action parameter filters the results by the type of search action that a filter is applied to. Valid values are:

    - Export: The filter is applied when exporting search results, or preparing them for analysis in eDiscovery Premium.
    - Preview: The filter is applied when previewing search results.
    - Purge: The filter is applied when purging search results. How the items are deleted is controlled by the PurgeType parameter value on the New-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet. The default value is SoftDelete, which means the purged items are recoverable by users until the deleted items retention period expires.
    - Search: The filter is applied when running a search.
    - All: The filter is applied to all search actions.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
