## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-OABVirtualDirectory -Identity "Server1\OAB (Default Web Site)" -ExternalUrl "https://www.contoso.com/OAB"
```

This example changes the external URL of the OAB virtual directory OAB (Default Web Site) to https://www.contoso.com/OAB.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the OAB virtual directory that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the virtual directory. For example:

- Name or \<Server\>\\Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

The Name value uses the syntax "\<VirtualDirectoryName\> (\<WebsiteName\>)" from the properties of the virtual directory. You can specify the wildcard character (\*) instead of the default website by using the syntax \<VirtualDirectoryName\>\*.

```yaml
Type: VirtualDirectoryIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BasicAuthentication
The BasicAuthentication parameter specifies whether Basic authentication is enabled on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

- $true: Basic authentication is enabled. This is the default value.

- $false: Basic authentication is disabled.

You can use this parameter with the WindowsAuthentication parameter.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExtendedProtectionFlags
The ExtendedProtectionFlags parameter specifies custom settings for Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

- None: This is the default setting.

- AllowDotlessSPN: Required if you want to use Service Principal Name (SPN) values that don't contain FQDNs (for example, HTTP/ContosoMail instead of HTTP/mail.contoso.com). You specify SPNs with the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter. This setting makes Extended Protection for Authentication less secure because dotless certificates aren't unique, so it isn't possible to ensure that the client-to-proxy connection was established over a secure channel.

- NoServiceNameCheck: The SPN list isn't checked to validate a channel binding token. This setting makes Extended Protection for Authentication less secure. We generally don't recommend this setting.

- Proxy: A proxy server is responsible for terminating the SSL channel. To use this setting, you need to register an SPN by using the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.

- ProxyCoHosting: HTTP and HTTPS traffic may be accessing the virtual directory, and a proxy server is located between at least some of the clients and the Client Access services on the Exchange server.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExtendedProtectionSPNList
The ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter specifies a list of valid Service Principal Names (SPNs) if you're using Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Valid values are:

- $null: This is the default value.

- Single SPN or comma delimited list of valid SPNs: The SPN value format is \<protocol\>/\<FQDN\>. For example, HTTP/mail.contoso.com. To add an SPN that's not an FQDN (for example, HTTP/ContosoMail), you also need to use the AllowDotlessSPN value for the ExtendedProtectionFlags parameter.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExtendedProtectionTokenChecking
The ExtendedProtectionTokenChecking parameter defines how you want to use Extended Protection for Authentication on the virtual directory. Extended Protection for Authentication isn't enabled by default. Valid values are:

- None: Extended Protection for Authentication isn't be used on the virtual directory. This is the default value.

- Allow: Extended Protection for Authentication is used for connections between clients and the virtual directory if both the client and server support it. Connections that don't support Extended Protection for Authentication will work, but may not be as secure as connections that use Extended Protection for Authentication.

- Require: Extended Protection for Authentication is used for all connections between clients and the virtual directory. If either the client or server doesn't support it, the connection will fail. If you use this value, you also need to set an SPN value for the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.

Note:

If you use the value Allow or Require, and you have a proxy server between the client and the Client Access services on the Mailbox server that's configured to terminate the client-to-proxy SSL channel, you also need to configure one or more Service Principal Names (SPNs) by using the ExtendedProtectionSPNList parameter.

```yaml
Type: ExtendedProtectionTokenCheckingMode
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExternalUrl
The ExternalURL parameter specifies the URL that's used to connect to the virtual directory from outside the firewall.

```yaml
Type: Uri
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InternalUrl
The InternalURL parameter specifies the URL that's used to connect to the virtual directory from inside the firewall.

```yaml
Type: Uri
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

```

### -RequireSSL
The RequireSSL parameter specifies whether the client connection to the virtual directory requires Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Valid values are:

```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
