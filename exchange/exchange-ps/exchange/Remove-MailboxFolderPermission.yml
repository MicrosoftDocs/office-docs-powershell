parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxFolderIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the target mailbox and folder. The syntax is `Mailbox:\Folder`. For the value of Mailbox, you can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    Example values for the Identity parameter are `john@contoso.com:\Calendar` or `John:\Marketing\Reports`.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ResetDelegateUserCollection
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The ResetDelegateUserCollection switch forces the removal of the LocalFreeBusy or the PR_FREEBUSY_ENTRYIDs files in case of corruption. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    Use this switch if you encounter problems trying add, change, or remove delegate permissions. Using this switch deletes those files and downgrades any existing delegates to Editor permissions. You'll need to grant delegate permissions again using `-SharingPermissionFlag Delegate`.

    When you use this switch, the value of Identity should be the user's primary calendar folder (for example, `kim@contoso.com:\Calendar`).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SendNotificationToUser
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The SendNotificationToUser parameter specifies whether to send a notification to the user when you remove their calendar permissions. Valid values are:

    - $true: A notification is sent.
    - $false: No notification is sent. This is the default value.

    This parameter only applies to calendar folders.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="MailboxFolderUserIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: User
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The User parameter specifies the mailbox, mail user, or mail-enabled security group (security principal) that's granted permission to the mailbox folder.

    For the best results, we recommend using the following values:

    - UPN: For example, `user@contoso.com` (users only).
    - Domain\\SamAccountName: For example, `contoso\user`.

    Otherwise, you can use any value that uniquely identifies the user or group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

name: Remove-MailboxFolderPermission
description: |-
  You can't use this cmdlet to selectively remove permissions from a user on a mailbox folder. The cmdlet removes all permissions that are assigned to the user on the specified folder. To modify the permissions that are assigned to the user on a mailbox folder, use the Set-MailboxFolderPermission cmdlet.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
