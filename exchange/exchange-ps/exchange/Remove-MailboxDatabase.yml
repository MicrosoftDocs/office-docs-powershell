parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  If the mailbox database has a database copy, the Remove-MailboxDatabase cmdlet also removes the copy.

  The Remove-MailboxDatabase cmdlet removes only the database object from Active Directory. It doesn't remove the physical database files. You must remove the database files manually after you run the Remove-MailboxDatabase cmdlet.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet.
