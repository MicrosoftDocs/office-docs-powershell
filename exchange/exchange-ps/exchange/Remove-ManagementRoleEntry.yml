### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  Use the Remove-ManagementRoleEntry cmdlet to remove existing management role entries.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

    To see the input types that this cmdlet accepts, see [Cmdlet Input and Output Types](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616387). If the Input Type field for a cmdlet is blank, the cmdlet doesn't accept input data.

examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    Remove-ManagementRoleEntry "Tier 1 Help Desk\New-Mailbox"
  description: |-
    This example removes the New-Mailbox role entry from the Tier 1 Help Desk role.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Get-ManagementRoleEntry "Tier 1 Help Desk\*" | where {$_.Name -like 'New-*'} | foreach {Remove-ManagementRoleEntry -Identity "$($_.id)\$($_.name)"}
  description: |-
    This example removes all the role entries that have the verb New on the Tier 1 Help Desk role by piping the output of the Get-ManagementRoleEntry cmdlet to the Where-Object cmdlet which specifies the verb filter, and then these results are piped to the Remove-ManagementRoleEntry cmdlet.

    This example forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding (we didn't use `-Confirm:$false` or `-Force`).

    **Note**: Exchange Online PowerShell requires the complex syntax as described, and the same command also works in the Exchange Management Shell in on-premises Exchange servers. The Exchange Management Shell supports much simpler syntax for the same result, but the command doesn't work in Exchange Online PowerShell: `Get-ManagementRoleEntry "Tier 1 Help Desk\New-* | Remove-ManagementRoleEntry`.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RoleEntryIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the role entry that you want to remove. This parameter uses the syntax: `<management role>\<role entry name>` (for example, `CustomRole\Set-Mailbox`).

    For more information about how management role entries work, see [Understanding management roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/understanding-management-roles-exchange-2013-help).

    If the role entry name contains spaces, enclose the name in quotation marks (").

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf

    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  The Remove-ManagementRoleEntry cmdlet removes existing role entries. However, you can't remove role entries from built-in management roles.

  For more information about management role entries, see [Understanding management roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/understanding-management-roles-exchange-2013-help).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
