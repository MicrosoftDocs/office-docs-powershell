  The cmdlets in Basic Mobility and Security are described in the following list:

  - DeviceTenantPolicy and DeviceTenantRule cmdlets: A policy that defines whether to block or allow mobile device access to Exchange Online email by unsupported devices that use Exchange ActiveSync only. This setting applies to all users in your organization. Both allow and block scenarios allow reporting for unsupported devices, and you can specify exceptions to the policy based on security groups.
  - DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy and DeviceConditionalAccessRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device access to Microsoft 365 for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups. Unsupported devices are not allowed to enroll in Basic Mobility and Security.
  - DeviceConfigurationPolicy and DeviceConfigurationRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device settings for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups.
  - Get-DevicePolicy: Returns all Basic Mobility and Security policies regardless of type (DeviceTenantPolicy, DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy or DeviceConfigurationPolicy).
