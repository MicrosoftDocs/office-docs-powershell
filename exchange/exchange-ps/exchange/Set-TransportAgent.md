# Set-TransportAgent

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Set-TransportAgent cmdlet to modify existing transport agents.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-TransportAgent [-Identity] <TransportAgentObjectId> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Priority <Int32>] [-WhatIf]
 [-TransportService <Hub | Edge | FrontEnd | MailboxSubmission | MailboxDelivery>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
Set-TransportAgent "Test App" -Priority 3 -TransportService -FrontEnd
```

This example modifies the priority of a fictitious agent named Test App in the Front End Transport service.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the name (Identity property value) of the transport agent that you want to modify. If the name contains spaces, enclose the name in quotation marks (").

```yaml
Type: TransportAgentObjectId
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Priority
The Priority parameter specifies the priority of the transport agent. The priority of the transport agent controls the order in which the transport agents process email messages. The priority must be a value between 0 and the maximum number of transport agents. The default behavior is to append a new transport agent to the end of the priority list. Transport agents with a priority closest to 0 process email messages first.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TransportService
The TransportService parameter specifies the transport service that you want to view or modify. Valid values for this parameter are:

- Hub for the Transport service on Mailbox servers.

- MailboxSubmission for the Mailbox Transport Submission service on Mailbox servers.

- MailboxDelivery for the Mailbox Transport Delivery service on Mailbox servers.

- FrontEnd for the Front End Transport service on Mailbox servers.

- Edge on Edge Transport servers.

```yaml
Type: Hub | Edge | FrontEnd | MailboxSubmission | MailboxDelivery
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
