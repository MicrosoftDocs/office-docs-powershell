### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

  Use the Upgrade-DistributionGroup cmdlet to upgrade distribution groups to Microsoft 365 Groups. This cmdlet only works on distribution groups, not mail-enabled security groups.

  **Note**: Before you use this cmdlet, verify there are no email address policies that you created with the IncludeUnifiedGroupRecipients parameter; otherwise the command will fail. Remove and recreate the email address policies after you upgrade your distribution groups to Microsoft 365 Groups.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).
