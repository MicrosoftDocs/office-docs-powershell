# Get-ConfigAnalyzerPolicyRecommendation

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Get-ConfigAnalyzerPolicyRecommendation cmdlet to compare the settings in your existing security policies to the settings that are used in the Standard or Strict preset security policies. Settings that are below the recommend value are returned in the results.

**Note**: We recommend that you use the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. For instructions, see [Use the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2).

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-ConfigAnalyzerPolicyRecommendation -RecommendedPolicyType <RecommendedPolicyType>
 [[-Identity] <ConfigAnalyzerPolicyRecommendationIdParameter>]
 [-IsAppliedToDisabled]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
For information about the policies and their recommended Standard and Strict values, see [Recommended settings for EOP and Office 365 ATP security](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365-atp).

The output of this cmdlet only returns settings that fall below the value that you've specified as a baseline (Standard or Strict).

The output contains the following information for each setting:

- PolicyGroup: The type of policy. The value will be Anti-Spam, Anti-Phishing, Anti-Malware, ATP Safe Links, or ATP Safe Attachments
- SettingName: The name of the setting in the policy.
- SettingNameDescription: A description of the setting.
- Policy: The name of the policy.
- AppliedTo: The number of users or domains that the policy applies to. If the policy isn't applied to anyone (for example, it's disabled), this value will be blank.
- CurrentConfiguration: The current value of the setting.
- LastModified: When the policy was last modified.
- Recommendation: The recommended Standard or Strict value for the setting.
- SettingType: For example, Boolean, String, or Integer.

If a setting is configured at or better than the Standard or Strict protection profile that you're comparing to, those settings/policies aren't returned in the results

This cmdlet returns the following output for each setting in each policy that falls below the recommended value.
