examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    Retry-Queue -Filter "NextHopDomain -eq "contoso.com" -and Status -eq 'Retry'"
  description: |-
    This example forces a connection attempt for all queues that meet the following criteria:

    - The queues are holding messages for the domain contoso.com.
    - The queues have a status of Retry.
    - The queues are located on the server on which the command is executed.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Filter parameter specifies one or more queues by using OPATH filter syntax. The OPATH filter includes a queue property name followed by a comparison operator and value (for example, `"NextHopDomain -eq 'contoso.com'"`). For details about filterable queue properties and comparison operators, see [Queue properties in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow/queues/queue-properties) and [Find queues and messages in queues in the Exchange Management Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow/queues/queues-and-messages-in-powershell).

    You can specify multiple criteria by using the and comparison operator. Property values that aren't expressed as an integer must be enclosed in quotation marks (").

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="QueueIdentity" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the queue. Valid input for this parameter uses the syntax Server\\Queue or Queue, for example, Mailbox01\\contoso.com or Unreachable. For details about queue identity, see [Queue identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow/queues/queues-and-messages-in-powershell#queue-identity).

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Resubmit
  description: |+
    The Resubmit parameter specifies whether the queue contents should be resubmitted to the categorizer before a connection is established. Valid input for this parameter is $true or $false.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    The Server parameter specifies the Exchange server where you want to run this command. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - FQDN
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Exchange Legacy DN

    If you don't use this parameter, the command is run on the local server.

    You can use the Server parameter and the Filter parameter in the same command. You can't use the Server parameter and the Identity parameter in the same command.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

name: Retry-Queue
description: |-
  The Retry-Queue cmdlet forces a connection attempt for a queue that has a status of Retry. The cmdlet establishes a connection to the next hop if possible. If a connection isn't established, a new retry time is set. To use this command to retry delivery of messages in the Unreachable queue, you must include the Resubmit parameter.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
