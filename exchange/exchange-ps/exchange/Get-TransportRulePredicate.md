# Get-TransportRulePredicate

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-TransportRulePredicate cmdlet to view the predicates (conditions and exceptions) that are available for transport rules (mal flow rules).

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-TransportRulePredicate [[-Name] <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Collectively, the conditions and exceptions in rules are known as predicates, because for every condition, there's a corresponding exception that uses the exact same settings and syntax. The only difference is conditions specify messages to include, while exceptions specify messages to exclude. That's why the output of this cmdlet doesn't list exceptions separately. Also, the names of some of the predicates that are returned by this cmdlet are different than the corresponding parameter names in the New-TransportRule and Set-TransportRule cmdlets.

In on-premises Exchange, the predicates that are available on Mailboxes servers and Edge Transports server are different.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
