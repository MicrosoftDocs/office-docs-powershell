### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Import-TransportRuleCollection cmdlet to import a transport rule collection. You can import a rule collection you previously exported as a backup, or import rules that you've exported from an older version of Exchange.

  **Note**: For replacement import functionality in Exchange Online using a PowerShell script, see [Import or export a mail flow rule collection in Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/manage-mail-flow-rules#import-or-export-a-mail-flow-rule-collection-in-exchange-online).

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  code: |-
    Import-TransportRuleCollection -FileData ([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('C:\TransportRules\ExportedRules.xml'))

    This example imports a transport rule collection from the XML file named ExportedRules.xml in the C:\\TransportRules folder.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Byte" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: FileData
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The FileData parameter specifies the XML file that contains the exported transport rule collection from the Export-TransportRuleCollection cmdlet.

    A valid value for this parameter requires you to read the file to a byte-encoded object using the following syntax: `([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('<Path>\<FileName>'))`. You can use this command as the parameter value, or you can write the output to a variable (`$data = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('<Path>\<FileName>')`) and use the variable as the parameter value (`$data`).

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"

  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RuleIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    This parameter is functional only in Exchange Server 2010.

    The Identity parameter specifies the transport rule that you want to import. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the rule. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  Importing a transport rule collection from an XML file removes or overwrites all pre-existing transport rules that were defined in your organization. Make sure that you have a backup of your current transport rule collection before you import and overwrite your current transport rules.

  For information about how to export a transport rule collection to an XML file, see [Export-TransportRuleCollection](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/export-transportrulecollection).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
