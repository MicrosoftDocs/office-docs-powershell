parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

    The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies the files that you want to block. Valid values are:

    - A exact file name (for example, BadFile.exe) or file name extension (for example, \*.exe). You need to use the value Filename for the Type parameter.
    - A valid MIME content type (for example, application/javascript or text/scriplet). You need to use the value ContentType for the Type parameter.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="AttachmentType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Type
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Type parameter specifies what type of attachment the attachment filter entry blocks. Valid values are:

    - ContentType: This value matches the attachment filter entry against the MIME content type that's specified in the Name parameter.
    - FileName: This value matches the attachment filter entry against the simple file name that's specified in the Name parameter.

description: |-
  On Edge Transport servers, the Attachment Filtering agent blocks attachments in messages based on the content type and the file name of the attachment. The configuration of the Attachment Filtering agent determines how messages that contain the specified attachments are processed. For more information about how to configure the Attachment Filtering agent, see [Set-AttachmentFilterListConfig](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-attachmentfilterlistconfig).

  On Edge Transport servers, you need to be a member of the local Administrators group to run this cmdlet.
