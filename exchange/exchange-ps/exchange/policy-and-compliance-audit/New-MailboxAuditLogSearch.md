# New-MailboxAuditLogSearch

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the New-MailboxAuditLogSearch cmdlet to search mailbox audit logs and have search results sent via email to specified recipients.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
New-MailboxAuditLogSearch [-EndDate <ExDateTime>
 -StartDate <ExDateTime> -StatusMailRecipients <MultiValuedProperty> [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-ExternalAccess <$true | $false>] [-LogonTypes <MultiValuedProperty>] [-Mailboxes <MultiValuedProperty>]
 [-Name <String>] [-ShowDetails] [-WhatIf] [-Operations <MultiValuedProperty>]
 [-HasAttachments <$true | $false>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The New-MailboxAuditLogSearch cmdlet performs an asynchronous search of mailbox audit logs for the specified mailboxes and sends the search results by email to the specified recipients. The body of the email message contains search metadata such as search parameters and the time when the search request was submitted. The results are attached in an .xml file.

To search mailbox audit logs for a single mailbox and have the results displayed in the Exchange Management Shell window, use the Search-MailboxAuditLog cmdlet instead. To learn more about mailbox audit logging, see Mailbox audit logging (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff459237.aspx).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
New-MailboxAuditLogSearch "Admin and Delegate Access" -Mailboxes "Ken Kwok","April Stewart" -LogonTypes Admin,Delegate -StartDate 1/1/2018 -EndDate 12/31/2018 -StatusMailRecipients auditors@contoso.com
```

This example creates a mailbox audit log search to search Ken Kwok and April Stewart's mailboxes for administrator and delegate logons from 1/1/2018 to 12/31/2018. Search results are sent to auditors@contoso.com by email.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
New-MailboxAuditLogSearch -ExternalAccess $true -StartDate 09/01/2018 -EndDate 10/24/2018 -StatusMailRecipients admin@contoso.com
```

This example returns entries from the mailbox audit logs of all users in organization for any mailbox access by Microsoft datacenter administrators between September 1, 2018 and October 24, 2018. The search results are sent to admin@contoso.com.

## PARAMETERS

### -EndDate
The EndDate parameter specifies the end date of the date range.

Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

```yaml
Type: ExDateTime
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StartDate
The StartDate parameter specifies the start date of the date range.

Use the short date format that's defined in the Regional Options settings on the computer where you're running the command. For example, if the computer is configured to use the short date format mm/dd/yyyy, enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day. If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

```yaml
Type: ExDateTime
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StatusMailRecipients
The StatusMailRecipients parameter specifies the email address of one or more recipients to whom search results are sent by email.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn

Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExternalAccess
The ExternalAccess parameter returns only audit log entries for mailbox access by a user outside of your organization. In Exchange Online, use this parameter to return audit log entries for access to a mailbox by Microsoft datacenter administrators.

```yaml
