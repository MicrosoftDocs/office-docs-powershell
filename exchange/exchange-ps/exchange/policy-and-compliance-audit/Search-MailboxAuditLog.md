## DESCRIPTION
The Search-MailboxAuditLog cmdlet performs a synchronous search of mailbox audit logs for one or more specified mailboxes and displays search results in the Exchange Management Shell window. To search mailbox audit logs for multiple mailboxes and have the results sent by email to specified recipients, use the New-MailboxAuditLogSearch cmdlet instead. To learn more about mailbox audit logging, see Mailbox audit logging (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff459237.aspx).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Search-MailboxAuditLog -Identity kwok -LogonTypes Admin,Delegate -StartDate 1/1/2018 -EndDate 12/31/2018 -ResultSize 2000
```

This example retrieves mailbox audit log entries for Ken Kwok's mailbox for actions performed by Admin and Delegate logon types between 1/1/2018 and 12/31/2018. A maximum of 2,000 log entries are returned.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Search-MailboxAuditLog -Mailboxes kwok,bsmith -LogonTypes Admin,Delegate -StartDate 1/1/2018 -EndDate 12/31/2018 -ResultSize 2000
```

This example retrieves mailbox audit log entries for Ken Kwok and Ben Smith's mailboxes for actions performed by Admin and Delegate logon types between 1/1/2018 and 12/31/2018. A maximum of 2,000 log entries are returned.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Search-MailboxAuditLog -Identity kwok -LogonTypes Owner -ShowDetails -StartDate 1/1/2016 -EndDate 3/1/2016 | Where-Object {$_.Operation -eq "HardDelete"}
```

This example retrieves mailbox audit log entries for Ken Kwok's mailbox for actions performed by the mailbox owner between 1/1/2016 and 3/1/2016. The results are piped to the Where-Object cmdlet and filtered to return only entries with the HardDelete action.
