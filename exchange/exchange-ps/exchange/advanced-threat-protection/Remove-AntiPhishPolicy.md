## SYNTAX

```
Remove-AntiPhishPolicy [-Identity] <AntiPhishPolicyIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-Force] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-server/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-AntiPhishPolicy -Identity "Quarantine Policy"
```

This example removes the antiphishing policy named Quarantine Policy.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the antiphishing policy that you want to remove. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

```yaml
Type: AntiPhishPolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
The Force switch specifies whether to suppress warning or confirmation messages. You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
