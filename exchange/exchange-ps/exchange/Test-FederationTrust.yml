parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MonitoringContext
  description: |+
    The MonitoringContext parameter specifies whether to include the associated monitoring events and performance counters in the results. Valid values are:

    - $true: Monitoring events and performance counters are included in the command results. Typically, you include the monitoring events and performance counters in the results when the output is passed to Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM).
    - $false: Monitoring events and performance counters aren't included in the command results. This is the default value.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="RecipientIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UserIdentity
  description: |+
    The UserIdentity parameter specifies a mailbox user to request a token for. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    If you don't specify a mailbox, the command uses the default test mailbox.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  The first time you use this cmdlet, you might be required to create a test user. To create a test user, run the following command:

  & $env:ExchangeInstallPath\Scripts\New-TestCasConnectivityUser.ps1

  You can run the Test-FederationTrust cmdlet from the Exchange Management Shell, or a monitoring system can run the test periodically.

  The Test-FederationTrust cmdlet runs the following series of tests to ensure that federation is working as expected:

  - A connection to the Microsoft Federation Gateway is established. This test ensures that communication between the local Exchange server and the Microsoft Federation Gateway is working correctly.
  - Certificates are checked to ensure they're valid and can be used with the Microsoft Federation Gateway.
  - A security token is requested from the Microsoft Federation Gateway. This test ensures that a token can be properly retrieved and used.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
