# Get-UMServer

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

Use the Get-UMServer cmdlet to view settings that are associated with the Unified Messaging (UM) server role.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-UMServer [[-Identity] <UMServerIdParameter>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-UMServer cmdlet retrieves the properties for a Unified Messaging server or returns a list of available UM servers from Active Directory. When the cmdlet is used for a single UM server, it returns the UM server properties including MaxCalls, MaxFaxCalls, and UMDialPlans. The properties and their values for the UM server are stored in the Unified Messaging section of the Exchange Server configuration object in Active Directory.

The ExchangeVersion attribute that's returned is the minimum version of Microsoft Exchange you can use to manage the returned object. This attribute isn't the same as the version of Microsoft Exchange that's displayed in the Exchange Management Console when you select Server Configuration.

After this task is completed, you can view the parameters and values for a single Unified Messaging server or a list of all of the Unified Messaging servers in Active Directory.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

### Example 1
```powershell
