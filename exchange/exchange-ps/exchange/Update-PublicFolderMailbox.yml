parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: InvokeSynchronizer
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The InvokeSynchronizer switch can only be used on secondary hierarchy public folder mailboxes and triggers hierarchy synchronization from the primary public folder mailbox to the specified secondary public folder mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch should only be used for troubleshooting purposes.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReconcileFolders
  description: |+
    The ReconcileFolders switch specifies whether to look closely for differences in the folder hierarchy between the primary public folder mailbox and the secondary public folder mailbox. Folders that exist in the primary public folder mailbox and not in the secondary will be recreated. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    In on-premises Exchange, folders that exist in the secondary public folder mailbox and not in the primary will be deleted.

    In Exchange Online, folders that exist in the secondary public folder mailbox and not in the primary will be moved to \NON_IPM_SUBTREE\LOST_AND_FOUND. See [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/introducing-public-folder-8220-lost-and-found-8221-functionality/ba-p/604043) for more details about LOST_AND_FOUND functionality.

    In both the scenarios, public folders that were deleted or moved to LOST_AND_FOUND can be restored using Set-PublicFolder command.

    This example restores the public folder named "Marketing" from LOST_AND_FOUND to the folder named \South

    `Get-PublicFolder \NON_IPM_SUBTREE\LOST_AND_FOUND\5773ba6a-9926-4d64-97db-63a2bdd94a5b\"Pesky Pole" | Set-PublicFolder -Path "\South"`

    This example restores the public folder named "Documents" from LOST_AND_FOUND to the folder named \Engineering

    `Set-PublicFolder -Identity \NON_IPM_SUBTREE\DUMPSTER_ROOT\DUMPSTER_EXTEND\RESERVED_1\RESERVED_1\9f32c468-4bc2-42aa-b979-16a057394b2f\Documents -Path \Engineering`

    **Note**: You should use the ReconcileFolders switch only for repair or troubleshooting purposes to look for differences in the public folder hierarchy that aren't detected by a regular synchronization. These undetected differences may occur in database failover or disaster recovery scenarios. You must use this switch with the InvokeSynchronizer switch.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SuppressStatus
  description: |+
    The SuppressStatus switch specifies that the output of this cmdlet is suppressed and that the command will run asynchronously in the background from the Exchange Management Shell. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can only use this switch with the InvokeSynchronizer switch.

    If you don't use this switch, the output will display status messages every 3 seconds for up to one minute. Until the minute passes, you can't use the PowerShell Window for other commands.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  This cmdlet only needs to be used if you want to manually invoke the hierarchy synchronizer and the mailbox assistant. Both these are invoked at least once every 24 hours for each public folder mailbox in the organization. The hierarchy synchronizer is invoked every 15 minutes if any users are logged on to a secondary mailbox through Outlook or an Exchange Web Services client.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
