  description: |-
    This example creates an Outlook Anywhere migration endpoint by using the Autodiscover parameter to detect the connection settings to the on-premises organization. Outlook Anywhere endpoints are used for cutover and staged Exchange migrations. The Get-Credential cmdlet is used to obtain the credentials for an on-premises account that has the necessary administrative privileges in the domain and that can access the mailboxes that will be migrated. When prompted for the user name, you can use either the email address or the domain\\username format for the administrator account. This account can be the same one that is specified by the EmailAddress parameter.

  description: |-
    This example creates an Outlook Anywhere migration endpoint by specifying the connection settings manually. Outlook Anywhere endpoints are used for cutover and staged Exchange migrations. The value for the ExchangeServer parameter specifies the on-premises Exchange server that hosts the mailboxes that will be migrated. The value for the RPCProxyServer parameter specifies the Exchange server in the on-premises organization that has the Client Access server role installed that directly accepts and proxies client connections. The EmailAddress parameter can specify any mailbox in the on-premises domain.

    It's recommended that you use a migration endpoint created with connection settings that are automatically discovered (see Example 3) because the Autodiscover service will be used to connect to each user mailbox in the migration batch. If you manually specify the connection settings for the endpoint and a user mailbox isn't located on the server specified by the ExchangeServer parameter, the migration for that user will fail. This is important if you have multiple on-premises Outlook Anywhere servers. Otherwise, you may need to create different migration endpoints that correspond to each on-premises server.

  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The MailboxPermission parameter specifies what permissions to use to access the source mailbox during Outlook Anywhere onboarding (staged Exchange migration and cutover Exchange migration).

    The migration administrator account specified for the endpoint must have one of the following permissions:

    - Admin: The account is a domain administrator who can access any mailbox they want to migrate.
    - FullAccess: The account is assigned either the Full Access permission to the mailboxes they want to migrate or the Receive As permission to the mailbox database that hosts the mailboxes that will be migrated.

    If this parameter isn't specified, the cmdlet tries to access source mailboxes using the domain administrator permission and if that fails, it then tries to access the source mailboxes using the Full Access or Receive As permissions.

    This parameter can't be used for creating non-Outlook Anywhere migration endpoints.

    The SourceMailboxLegacyDN parameter specifies the LegacyExchangeDN value of an on-premises mailbox that's used to test the ability of the migration service to create a connection using this endpoint. The cmdlet tries to access this mailbox using the credentials for the administrator account specified in the command.

    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The TestMailbox parameter specifies an Exchange Online mailbox used as the target by the migration service to verify the connection using this endpoint. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    If you don't use this parameter, the migration service uses the migration arbitration mailbox in the Exchange Online organization to verify the connection.

    This parameter is only used to create Outlook Anywhere migration endpoints.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf

    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  The New-MigrationEndpoint cmdlet configures the connection settings for different types of migrations:

  - Cross-forest move: Move mailboxes between two different on-premises Exchange forests. Cross-forest moves require the use of a Remote Move endpoint.
  - Remote move migration: In a hybrid deployment, a remote move migration involves onboarding or offboarding migrations. Remote move migrations also require the use of an Exchange remote move endpoint. Onboarding moves mailboxes from an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online, and uses a remote move endpoint as the source endpoint of the migration batch. Offboarding moves mailboxes from Exchange Online to an on-premises Exchange organization and uses a remote move endpoint as the target endpoint of the migration batch.
  - Cutover Exchange migration: Migrate all mailboxes in an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online. A cutover Exchange migration requires the use of an Outlook Anywhere migration endpoint.
  - Staged Exchange migration: Migrate a subset of mailboxes from an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online. A staged Exchange migration requires the use of an Outlook Anywhere migration endpoint.
  - IMAP migration: Migrate mailbox data from an on-premises Exchange organization or other email system to Exchange Online. For an IMAP migration, you must first create the cloud-based mailboxes before you migrate mailbox data. IMAP migrations require the use of an IMAP endpoint.
  - Google Workspace migration: Migration mailbox data from a Google Workspace tenant to Exchange Online. For a Google Workspace migration, you must first create cloud-based mail users or mailboxes before you migrate mailbox data. Google Workspace migrations require the use of a Gmail endpoint.

  Moving mailboxes between different servers or databases within a single on-premises Exchange forest (called a local move) doesn't require a migration endpoint.
