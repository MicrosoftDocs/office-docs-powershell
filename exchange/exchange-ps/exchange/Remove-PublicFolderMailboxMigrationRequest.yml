parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is functional only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequestIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the public folder mailbox migration request that you want to remove. This value uses the syntax `\PublicFolderMailboxMigration<GUID>` (for example, `\PublicFolderMailboxMigrationac6d9eb4-ee49-405f-b90d-04e9a258bd7e`).

    You can't use this parameter with the RequestGuid or RequestQueue parameters.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequestGuid
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The RequestGuid parameter specifies the unique RequestGuid identifier of the request. To find the RequestGuid value, use the Get-PublicFolderMailboxMigrationRequest cmdlet.

    If you use this parameter, you also need to use the RequestQueue parameter. You can't use either of these parameters with the Identity parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequestQueue
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The RequestQueue parameter identifies the request based on the mailbox database where the request is being run. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't use this parameter with the Identity parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.
