parameters:
- type: <xref href="DeviceAccessLevel" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AccessLevel
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The AccessLevel parameter specifies the access level of devices that are defined by the rule. Valid values for this parameter are Allow, Block and Quarantine.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DeviceAccessCharacteristic" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Characteristic
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Characteristic parameter specifies the device characteristic or category that's used by the rule. Valid values for this parameter are:

    - DeviceModel
    - DeviceType
    - DeviceOS
    - UserAgent
    - XMSWLHeader

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: QueryString
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The QueryString parameter specifies the device identifier that's used by the rule. This parameter uses a text value that's used with Characteristic parameter value to define the device. Wildcards or partial matches aren't allowed.

    You can use the Get-MobileDevice cmdlet to find the text values that you can use with the QueryString parameter. For example: Get-MobileDevice | Format-List DeviceOS,DeviceModel,DeviceType.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
