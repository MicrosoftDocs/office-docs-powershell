## SYNTAX

```
Get-OrganizationConfig [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-OrganizationConfig -DomainController ContosoDC
```

This example gets the organization configuration information for the domain controller ContosoDC.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-OrganizationConfig | Export-CliXML C:\Data\MyFile.xml
```

This example gets the configuration information for the cloud-based organization.

For more information, see [Troubleshoot a hybrid deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/hybrid-deployment/troubleshoot-a-hybrid-deployment).

### Example 3
```powershell
Get-OrganizationConfig | Format-List EwsApplicationAccessPolicy,Ews*List
```

This example shows the applications that are allowed access to EWS and REST.

If the value of EwsApplicationAccessPolicy is EnforceAllowList, only the applications specified in EwsAllowList are allowed to access EWS and REST.

If the value of EwsApplicationAccessPolicy is EnforceBlockList, all applications are allowed to access EWS and REST, except those specified in EwsBlockList.

## PARAMETERS

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.
