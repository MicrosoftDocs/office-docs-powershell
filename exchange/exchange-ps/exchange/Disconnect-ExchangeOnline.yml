    Disconnect-ExchangeOnline -ConnectionId 1a9e45e8-e7ec-498f-9ac3-0504e987fa85
  description: |-
    This example disconnects the REST-based Exchange Online PowerShell connection with the specified ConnectionId value. Any other remote PowerShell connections to Exchange Online PowerShell or Security & Compliance PowerShell in the same Windows PowerShell window are also disconnected.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ConnectionId
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    **Note**: This parameter is available in version 3.2.0 or later of the module.

    The ConnectionId parameter specifies the REST API connections to disconnect by ConnectionId. ConnectionId is a GUID value in the output of the Get-ConnectionInformation cmdlet that uniquely identifies a connection, even if you have multiple connections open. You can specify multiple ConnectionId values separated by commas.

    Don't use this parameter with the ModulePrefix parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ModulePrefix
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    **Note**: This parameter is available in version 3.2.0 or later of the module.

    The ModulePrefix parameter specifies the REST API connections to disconnect by ModulePrefix. When you use the Prefix parameter with the Connect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet, the specified text is added to the names of all Exchange Online cmdlets (for example, Get-InboundConnector becomes Get-ContosoInboundConnector). The ModulePrefix value is visible in the output of the Get-ConnectionInformation cmdlet. You can specify multiple ModulePrefix values separated by commas.

    Don't use this parameter with the ConnectionId parameter.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Disconnect-ExchangeOnline
name: Disconnect-ExchangeOnline
description: |-
  This cmdlet is the counterpart to the Connect-ExchangeOnline and Connect-IPPSSession cmdlets.

  This cmdlet disconnects any connections and clears the cache. After a successful disconnect, you can't successfully run any cmdlets for your organization.

  Disconnect commands will likely fail if the profile path of the account that you used to connect contains special PowerShell characters (for example, `$`). The workaround is to connect using a different account that doesn't have special characters in the profile path.
