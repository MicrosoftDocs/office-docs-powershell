# Get-ConnectionByClientTypeReport

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

This cmdlet was deprecated in January, 2018. For information about the available replacement Microsoft Graph reports in Office 365, see the subtopics of Working with Office 365 usage reports in Microsoft Graph (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=865135).

Use the Get-ConnectionByClientTypeReport cmdlet to view a summary of the different types of clients that connected to all mailboxes in your organization. The client types indicate different protocols, for example, Outlook on the web, MAPI, POP3, IMAP4, Exchange ActiveSync, and Exchange Web Services.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-ConnectionByClientTypeReport [-EndDate <DateTime>] [-ReportType <Daily | Weekly | Monthly | Yearly>] [-ResultSize <Unlimited>] [-StartDate <DateTime>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Note: There's a 7-day lag in the client connection information that's returned by this cmdlet. For example, if you run the cmdlet on June 18, 2018, you can't retrieve information about connections made to mailboxes between June 13, 2018 and June 15, 2018. To get connection information for that date range, you need to run the cmdlet on June 22, 2018 or later.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
