## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

For more information about the limits for allowed and blocked senders, see [Exchange Online Protection Limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-protection-service-description/exchange-online-protection-limits).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity "Contoso Executives" -HighConfidenceSpamAction Quarantine -SpamAction Quarantine -BulkThreshold 6
```

This example modifies the spam filter policy named Contoso Executives with the following settings:

- Quarantine messages when the spam filtering verdict is spam or high confidence spam.

- BCL 6 triggers the action for a bulk email spam filtering verdict.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the spam filter policy that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

```yaml
Type: HostedContentFilterPolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AddXHeaderValue
The AddXHeaderValue parameter specifies the X-header name (not value) to add to spam messages when a spam filtering verdict parameter is set to the value AddXHeader. The following spam filtering verdict parameters can use the AddXHeader action:

- BulkSpamAction

- HighConfidenceSpamAction

- PhishSpamAction

- SpamAction

The maximum length is 255 characters, and the value can't contain spaces or colons (:).

For example, if you enter the value `This-is-my-custom-header`, the X-header that's added to the message is `This-is-my-custom-header: This message appears to be spam.`

If you enter a value that contains spaces or colons (:), the value is ignored, and the default X-header is added to the message (`X-This-Is-Spam: This message appears to be spam.`).

Note that this setting is independent of the AddXHeader value of the TestModeAction parameter.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AdminDisplayName
The AdminDisplayName parameter specifies a description for the policy. The maximum length is 256 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllowedSenderDomains
The AllowedSenderDomains parameter specifies trusted domains that aren't processed by the spam filter. Messages from senders in these domains are stamped with `SFV:SKA` in the `X-Forefront-Antispam-Report header` and receive a spam confidence level (SCL) of -1, so the messages are delivered to the recipient's inbox. Valid values are one or more SMTP domains.

**Caution**: Think very carefully before you add domains here. For more information, see [Create safe sender lists in EOP](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/create-safe-sender-lists-in-office-365).

To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: \<value1\>,\<value2\>,...\<valueN\>. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, you need to use the following syntax: "\<value1\>","\<value2\>",..."\<valueN\>".

To add or remove one or more values without affecting any existing entries, use the following syntax: @{Add="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...; Remove="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...}.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllowedSenders
The AllowedSenders parameter specifies a list of trusted senders that skip spam filtering. Messages from these senders are stamped with SFV:SKA in the X-Forefront-Antispam-Report header and receive an SCL of -1, so the messages are delivered to the recipient's inbox. Valid values are one or more SMTP email addresses.

**Caution**: Think very carefully before you add senders here. For more information, see [Create safe sender lists in EOP](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/create-safe-sender-lists-in-office-365).

To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: \<value1\>,\<value2\>,...\<valueN\>. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, you need to use the following syntax: "\<value1\>","\<value2\>",..."\<valueN\>".

To add or remove one or more values without affecting any existing entries, use the following syntax: @{Add="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...; Remove="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...}.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BlockedSenderDomains
The BlockedSenderDomains parameter specifies domains that are always marked as spam sources. Messages from senders in these domains are stamped with `SFV:SKB` value in the `X-Forefront-Antispam-Report` header and receive an SCL of 9 (high confidence spam). Valid values are one or more SMTP domains.

**Note**: Manually blocking domains isn't dangerous, but it can increase your administrative workload. For more information, see [Create block sender lists in EOP](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/create-block-sender-lists-in-office-365?).

To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: \<value1\>,\<value2\>,...\<valueN\>. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, you need to use the following syntax: "\<value1\>","\<value2\>",..."\<valueN\>".

To add or remove one or more values without affecting any existing entries, use the following syntax: @{Add="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...; Remove="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...}.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BlockedSenders
The BlockedSenders parameter specifies senders that are always marked as spam sources. Messages from these senders are stamped with `SFV:SKB` in the `X-Forefront-Antispam-Report` header and receive an SCL of 9 (high confidence spam). Valid values are one or more SMTP email addresses.

**Note**: Manually blocking senders isn't dangerous, but it can increase your administrative workload. For more information, see [Create block sender lists in EOP](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/create-block-sender-lists-in-office-365?).

To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: \<value1\>,\<value2\>,...\<valueN\>. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, you need to use the following syntax: "\<value1\>","\<value2\>",..."\<valueN\>".

To add or remove one or more values without affecting any existing entries, use the following syntax: @{Add="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...; Remove="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...}.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BulkSpamAction
The BulkSpamAction parameter specifies the action to take on messages that are marked as bulk email (also known as gray mail) based on the bulk complaint level (BCL) of the message, and the BCL threshold you configure in the BulkThreshold parameter. Valid values are:

- AddXHeader: Add the AddXHeaderValue parameter value to the message header and deliver the message.

- Delete: Delete the message during filtering. Use caution when selecting this value, because you can't recover the deleted message.

- ModifySubject: Add the ModifySubject parameter value to the beginning of the subject line, deliver the message, and move the message to the Junk Email folder (same caveats as MoveToJmf).

- MoveToJmf: This is the default value. Deliver the message to the recipient's mailbox, and move the message to the Junk Email folder. In Exchange Online, the message is only moved if the junk email rule is enabled on the mailbox (it's enabled by default). For more information, see [Configure junk email settings on Exchange Online mailboxes](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/configure-junk-email-settings-on-exo-mailboxes). In standalone Exchange Online Protection environments, you need to configure mail flow rules in your on-premises Exchange organization. For instructions, see [Configure standalone EOP to deliver spam to the Junk Email folder in hybrid environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/ensure-that-spam-is-routed-to-each-user-s-junk-email-folder).

- NoAction

- Quarantine: Move the message to the quarantine. The quarantined message is available to the intended recipients and admins.

- Redirect: Redirect the message to the recipients specified by the RedirectToRecipients parameter.

```yaml
Type: SpamFilteringAction
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BulkThreshold
The BulkThreshold parameter specifies the BCL that triggers the BulkSpamAction on the message (greater than the specified value, not greater than or equal to). A valid value is an integer from 1 to 9, and the default value is 7. A higher value indicates the message is more likely to generate complaints (and is therefore more likely to be spam). For more information, see [Bulk compliant level (BCL) in EOP](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/bulk-complaint-level-values).

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
