examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    Get-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup DAG1 | Format-List
  description: |-
    This example displays the basic properties of the DAG DAG1. The output for the command is formatted as a list.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Get-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup DAG2 -Status | Format-List
  description: |-
    This example displays the properties of the DAG DAG2. Because it includes the Status parameter, the task also displays real-time status information for DAG2, such as the current list of operational servers and the server currently holding the Primary Active Manager role. In addition, several properties of the DAG, such as the witness server and directory configuration information are also displayed. The output for the command is formatted as a list.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DatabaseAvailabilityGroupIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the name of the DAG to query.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016

uid: ExchangePowerShell.Get-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup
name: Get-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup
description: |-
  In addition to obtaining a list of DAG members, the Get-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup cmdlet can also be used to view real-time status information about a DAG, such as:

  - OperationalServers
  - PrimaryActiveManager
  - ReplicationPort
  - NetworkNames
  - WitnessShareInUse

  Use the Status parameter with the command to include the values for these listed properties. Without the Status parameter, the values returned for these properties are blank.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet.
