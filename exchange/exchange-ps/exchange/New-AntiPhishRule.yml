parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AntiPhishPolicy
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The AntiPhishPolicy parameter specifies the antiphish policy that's associated with the antiphish rule.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - GUID

    You can't specify the default antiphish policy. And, you can't specify an antiphish policy that's already associated with another antiphish rule.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comments
  description: |+
    The Comments parameter specifies informative comments for the rule, such as what the rule is used for or how it has changed over time. The length of the comment can't exceed 1024 characters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    The Enabled parameter specifies whether the rule is enabled. Valid values are:

    - $true: The rule is enabled. This is the default value.
    - $false: The rule is disabled.

    In the properties of the rule, the value of this parameter is visible in the State property.

  name: ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs
  description: |+
    The ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients with email addresses in the specified domains. You can specify multiple domains separated by commas.

  name: ExceptIfSentTo
  description: |+
    The ExceptIfSentTo parameter specifies an exception that looks for recipients in messages. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""

  name: ExceptIfSentToMemberOf
  description: |+
    The ExceptIfSentToMemberOf parameter specifies an exception that looks for messages sent to members of distribution groups, mail-enabled security groups, or sent to Microsoft 365 Groups. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

    If you remove the group after you create the rule, no exception is made for messages that are sent to members of the group.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Name parameter specifies a unique name for the antiphish rule. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Priority
  description: |+
    The Priority parameter specifies a priority value for the rule that determines the order of rule processing. A lower integer value indicates a higher priority, the value 0 is the highest priority, and rules can't have the same priority value.

    Valid values and the default value for this parameter depend on the number of existing rules. For example, if there are 8 existing rules:

    - Valid priority values for the existing 8 rules are from 0 through 7.
    - Valid priority values for a new rule (the 9th rule) are from 0 through 8.
    - The default value for a new rule (the 9th rule) is 8.

    If you modify the priority value of a rule, the position of the rule in the list changes to match the priority value you specify. In other words, if you set the priority value of a rule to the same value as an existing rule, the priority value of the existing rule and all other lower priority rules after it is increased by 1.

    - Email address
    - GUID
