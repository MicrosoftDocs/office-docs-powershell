# Get-DomainController

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Get-DomainController cmdlet to view a list of domain controllers that exist in your organization.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

### GlobalCatalog
```
Get-DomainController [-GlobalCatalog] [-Forest <Fqdn>]
 [-Credential <NetworkCredential>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### DomainController
```
Get-DomainController [-DomainName <Fqdn>]
 [-Credential <NetworkCredential>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The Get-DomainController cmdlet is used by the Exchange admin center to populate fields that display domain controller information.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
$UserCredentials = Get-Credential; Get-DomainController -DomainName corp.contoso.com -Credential $UserCredentials | Format-Table -AutoSize Name, ADSite
```

This example retrieves a list of global catalog servers in the corp.contoso.com domain. Because a different set of credentials are required to access this domain, the Get-Credential cmdlet is used to obtain the username and password from the user.

The first command displays a prompt to the user that accepts the username and password. The credentials are then stored in the $UserCredentials variable. The second command uses the $UserCredentials variable for the Credential parameter value. To make the list more readable, the output is piped to the Format-Table cmdlet and only the Name and ADSite properties are displayed.

For more information about pipelining and the Format-Table cmdlet, see [About Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_pipelines) and [Working with command output](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/working-with-command-output-exchange-2013-help).
