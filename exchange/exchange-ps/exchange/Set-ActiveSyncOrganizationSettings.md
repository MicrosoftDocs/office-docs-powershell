## SYNTAX

```
Set-ActiveSyncOrganizationSettings [[-Identity] <ActiveSyncOrganizationSettingsIdParameter>] [-AdminMailRecipients <MultiValuedProperty>] [-AllowAccessForUnSupportedPlatform <Boolean>] [-AllowRMSSupportForUnenlightenedApps <Boolean>] [-Confirm] [-DefaultAccessLevel <DeviceAccessLevel>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-OtaNotificationMailInsert <String>] [-UserMailInsert <String>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-ActiveSyncOrganizationSettings -DefaultAccessLevel Quarantine -AdminMailRecipients will@contoso.com,roger@contoso.com
```

This example sets the default access level to quarantine and sets two administrative email addresses.

## PARAMETERS

### -AdminMailRecipients
The AdminMailRecipients parameter specifies the email addresses of the administrators for reporting purposes.

To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: \<value1\>,\<value2\>,...\<valueN\>. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, you need to use the following syntax: "\<value1\>","\<value2\>",..."\<valueN\>".

To add or remove one or more values without affecting any existing entries, use the following syntax: @{Add="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...; Remove="\<value1\>","\<value2\>"...}.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllowAccessForUnSupportedPlatform
This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllowRMSSupportForUnenlightenedApps
The AllowRMSSupportForUnenlightenedApps parameter specifies whether to allow Rights Management Services (RMS) protected messages for ActiveSync clients that don't support RMS. Valid values are:

- $true

- $false (This is the default value)

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DefaultAccessLevel
The DefaultAccessLevel parameter specifies the access level for new and existing device partnerships. Valid values are:

- Allow (This is the default value)

- Block

- Quarantine

If you change this value from Allow to Block or Quarantine, all existing connected devices are immediately affected, unless the devices are subject to device access rules or individual allow or block list entries.

```yaml
Type: DeviceAccessLevel
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)

```

### -UserMailInsert
The UserMailInsert parameter specifies an informational footer that's added to the email message sent to users when their mobile device isn't synchronized because the device is quarantined.

The maximum length is 256 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
