# Get-SharingPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Get-SharingPolicy cmdlet to view existing sharing policies that control how users inside your organization can share free/busy and contact information with users outside your organization.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-SharingPolicy [[-Identity] <SharingPolicyIdParameter>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Users can only share free/busy and contact information after federation has been configured between Exchange organizations. After that, users can send sharing invitations to the external recipients as long as those invitations comply with the sharing policy. A sharing policy needs to be assigned to a mailbox to be effective. If a mailbox doesn't have a specific sharing policy assigned, a default policy enforces the sharing settings for the mailbox.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
