# Get-ClientAccessArray

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Get-ClientAccessArray cmdlet to view legacy RPC Client Access arrays (load-balanced arrays of Client Access servers within a single Active Directory site) that exist in your Exchange organization.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-ClientAccessArray [[-Identity] <ClientAccessArrayIdParameter>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Site <AdSiteIdParameter>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Client Access arrays were introduced in Exchange Server 2010 so Outlook clients in an Active Directory site could access the Client Access servers in the array by using RPC over TCP to a single, unified, fully qualified domain name (FQDN). The RpcClientAccessServer property of new mailbox databases was automatically populated with the FQDN of the Client Access array and this value was used during the creation of Outlook profiles for mailboxes in those databases.

Changes in the Exchange server architecture that were introduced in Exchange Server 2013 removed the need for RPC Client Access arrays:

- Outlook clients can't use RPC over TCP to access mailboxes on Exchange Server 2013 or later versions and RPC Client Access arrays only work with RPC over TCP.

- Because the Client Access server role is now a stateless proxy, you use different and less complex methods to configure load balancing and high availability for internal and external client connections. For more information, see [Load balancing in Exchange Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/architecture/client-access/load-balancing).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-ClientAccessArray
```

This example returns a summary list of all Client Access arrays that exist in the local Active Directory site.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-ClientAccessArray -Identity CASArray01 | Format-List
```

This example returns detailed information for the Client Access array named CASArray01.

## PARAMETERS

### -DomainController
The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the Client Access array that you want to view. You can use these values:

- Name (if the value doesn't contain spaces)

- Distinguished name (DN)

- ExchangeLegacyDN

- Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)

- GUID

```yaml
Type: ClientAccessArrayIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Site
The Site parameter filters the results by Active Directory site. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the site. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

- To see a list of available sites, use the Get-ADSite cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: AdSiteIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
