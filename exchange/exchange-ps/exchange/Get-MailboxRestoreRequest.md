## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-MailboxRestoreRequest -Identity "ayla\MailboxRestore"
```

This example returns the status of the in-progress and queued restore request with the identity ayla\\MailboxRestore.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-MailboxRestoreRequest -TargetDatabase MBD01
```

In Exchange Server 2010, this example returns the status of in progress and queued restore requests that are being restored to the target database MBD01.

### Example 3
```powershell
Get-MailboxRestoreRequest -RequestQueue MBD01
```

This example returns the status of in-progress and queued restore requests that are being restored to the mailbox database MBD01.

### Example 4
```powershell
Get-MailboxRestoreRequest -Name "RestoreToMBD01" -Suspend $true
```

This example returns all restore requests that have the name RestoreToMBD01 where the restore request has been suspended.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the identity of the restore request. The Identity parameter consists of the alias of the mailbox to be restored and the name that was specified when the restore request was created. The identity of the restore request uses the following syntax: \<alias\>\\\<name\>.

If you didn't specify a name for the restore request when it was created, Exchange automatically generated the default name MailboxRestore. Exchange generates up to 10 names, starting with MailboxRestore and then MailboxRestoreX (where X = 1-9).

You can't use this parameter with the Name parameter.

```yaml
Type: MailboxRestoreRequestIdParameter

Accept wildcard characters: False
```
