## DESCRIPTION
You can retrieve role assignments in a variety of ways including by assignment type, scope type, or name, and whether the assignment is enabled or disabled. You can also view a list of role assignments that provide access to a specified recipient, server, or database.

For more information about management role assignments, see [Understanding management role assignments](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/understanding-management-role-assignments-exchange-2013-help).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
