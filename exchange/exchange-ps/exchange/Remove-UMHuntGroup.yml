  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

description: |-
  The Remove-UMHuntGroup cmdlet deletes an existing UM hunt group from Active Directory. When the Remove-UMHuntGroup cmdlet is used, the UM hunt group is removed from the UM IP gateway and then deleted from Active Directory. If the operation leaves the UM IP gateway without any remaining configured UM hunt groups, the IP gateway can't handle or process Unified Messaging calls.

  After this task is completed, the UM hunt group is removed from Active Directory.
