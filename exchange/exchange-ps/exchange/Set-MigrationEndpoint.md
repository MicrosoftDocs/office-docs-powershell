# Set-MigrationEndpoint

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Set-MigrationEndpoint cmdlet to edit settings for cutover or staged Exchange migrations, IMAP migrations, G Suite migrations, and remote moves.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## DESCRIPTION
Use the Set-MigrationEndpoint cmdlet to configure settings for different types of migration:

- Cross-forest move: Move mailboxes between two different on-premises Exchange forests. Cross-forest moves require the use of a RemoteMove endpoint.

- Remote move: In a hybrid deployment, a remote move involves onboarding or offboarding migrations. Remote moves require the use of a RemoteMove endpoint. Onboarding moves mailboxes from an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online, and uses a RemoteMove endpoint as the source endpoint of the migration batch. Offboarding moves mailboxes from Exchange Online to an on-premises Exchange organization and uses a RemoteMove endpoint as the target endpoint of the migration batch.

- Cutover Exchange migration: Migrate all mailboxes in an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online. Cutover Exchange migration requires the use of an Exchange endpoint.

- Staged Exchange migration: Migrate a subset of mailboxes from an on-premises Exchange organization to Exchange Online. Staged Exchange migration requires the use of an Exchange endpoint.

- IMAP migration: Migrate mailbox data from an on-premises Exchange organization or other email system to Exchange Online. For an IMAP migration, you must first create the cloud-based mailboxes before you migrate mailbox data. IMAP migrations require the use of an IMAP endpoint.

- Gmail migration: Migration mailbox data from a G Suite tenant to Exchange Online.  For a G Suite migration, you must first create the cloud-based mail users or mailboxes before you migrate mailbox data. G Suite migrations require the use of a Gmail endpoint.

- Local: Move mailboxes between different servers or databases within a single on-premises Exchange forest. Local moves don't require the use of an endpoint.

For more information about the different move and migration scenarios, see:

- [Mailbox moves in Exchange Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/recipients/mailbox-moves)

- [Manage on-premises mailbox moves in Exchange Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/architecture/mailbox-servers/manage-mailbox-moves)

Changes made to an endpoint that affect the individual users within the batch are applied starting at the next time that the batch is processed. If you are running this cmdlet in the cloud-based service and wish to speed up the application of these settings, consider running the Set-MigrationBatch cmdlet with the -Update parameter.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-MigrationEndpoint -Identity CutoverExchangeEndpoint01 -MaxConcurrentIncrementalSyncs 50 -NspiServer Server01.contoso.com
```

This example changes the MaxConcurrentIncrementalSyncs setting to 50 on the CutoverExchangeEndpoint01 migration endpoint using the NSPI server Server01.

### Example 2
```powershell
Set-MigrationEndpoint -Identity Onboardingmigrationendpoint01 -MaxConcurrentMigrations 10 -RemoteServer Server01.contoso.com
```

This example changes the MaxConcurrentMigrations setting to 10 on the Onboardingmigrationendpoint01 migration endpoint using the remote server, Server01.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the name of the migration endpoint you want to configure.

```yaml
Type: MigrationEndpointIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Authentication
This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

The Authentication parameter specifies the authentication method used by the remote mail server.

```yaml
Type: AuthenticationMethod
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credentials
The Credentials parameter specifies the username and password for connecting to the remote endpoint. Credentials should be used when creating either a staged or cutover Exchange endpoint or a RemoteMove endpoint.

A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see [Get-Credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
