### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

  Use the Test-EcpConnectivity cmdlet to test connectivity to Exchange Control Panel (ECP) virtual directories.

  **Note**: This cmdlet works best in Exchange 2010. In later versions of Exchange, the functionality of this cmdlet has been replaced by Managed Availability. For the best results, use the Invoke-MonitoringProbe cmdlet and specify the relevant active monitor probe instead of using this cmdlet.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="ServerIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ClientAccessServer
  description: |+
    The ClientAccessServer parameter specifies the Exchange server to test. This server has the Client Access server role installed and is responsible for accepting client connections.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - ExchangeLegacyDN
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: MailboxServer
  description: |+
    The MailboxServer parameter specifies the Exchange Mailbox server that you want to test. This parameter identifies the backend server that accepts proxied connections from the frontend server where clients connect.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:

    - Name
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - ExchangeLegacyDN
    - GUID

    If you don't use this parameter, connections to all Mailbox servers in the local Active Directory site are tested.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MonitoringContext
  description: |+
    The MonitoringContext switch includes the associated monitoring events and performance counters in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    Typically, you include the monitoring events and performance counters in the results when the output is passed to Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  name: ResetTestAccountCredentials
  description: |+
    The ResetTestAccountCredentials switch resets the password for the test account that's used to run this command. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    The password for the test account is typically reset every seven days. Use this switch to force a password reset any time it's required for security reasons.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Timeout
  description: |+
    The Timeout parameter specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the test operation to finish. The default value for the Timeout parameter is 30 seconds. You must specify a time-out value greater than 0 seconds and less than 1 hour (3,600 seconds). We recommend that you always configure this parameter with a value of 5 seconds or more.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TrustAnySSLCertificate
  description: |+
    The TrustAnySSLCertificate switch allows Exchange to accept certificates from untrusted certification authorities (CAs). You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This switch is useful for testing internal URLs, because a URL that has an associated certificate is typically an external URL. This switch lets the task check an internal URL without generating an error when the certificate doesn't match the URL.

  The Test-EcpConnectivity cmdlet tests EAC connectivity by connecting to a specified EAC virtual directory, to any EAC virtual directories on a specified Exchange server, or to any EAC virtual directories that are available in the local Active Directory site.

  The first time you use this cmdlet, you might be required to create a test user. To create a test user, run the following command:

  & $env:ExchangeInstallPath\Scripts\New-TestCasConnectivityUser.ps1

  The test results are displayed on-screen. The cmdlet returns the following information.

  - CasServer: The Exchange server that the client connected to.
  - LocalSite: The name of the local Active Directory site.
  - Scenario: The operations that are tested. Values are: Logon and Sign in.
  - Result: The values returned are typically Success, Skipped or Failure.
  - Latency(MS): The time required to complete the test in milliseconds.
  - Error: Any error messages that were encountered.

  You can write the results to a file by piping the output to ConvertTo-Html and Set-Content. For example: `Test-EcpConnectivity -ClientAccessServer MBX01 | ConvertTo-Html | Set-Content -Path "C:\My Documents\EAC Test.html"`.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
