parameters:
- type: <xref href="Unlimited" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AnonymousCutoffBalance
  description: |+
    The AnonymousCutoffBalance parameter specifies the resource consumption limits for an anonymous user before the user is completely blocked from performing operations on a specific component.

  name: AnonymousMaxBurst
  description: |+
    The AnonymousMaxBurst parameter specifies the amount of time that an anonymous user can consume an elevated amount of resources before being throttled. This is measured in milliseconds. This value is set separately for each component.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  name: AnonymousMaxConcurrency
  description: |+
    The AnonymousMaxConcurrency parameter specifies how many anonymous connections can be made to a user's calendar data at the same time. A connection is held from the moment a request is received until a response is sent in its entirety to the requestor. If anonymous users attempt to make more concurrent requests than their policy allows, the new connection attempt fails. However, the existing connections remain valid. The AnonymousMaxConcurrency parameter has a valid range from 0 through 2147483647 inclusive. The default value is 1. To indicate that the number of concurrent connections should be unthrottled (no limit), this value should be set to $null.

  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

    The AnonymousPercentTimeInAD parameter specifies the percentage of a minute that anonymous users can spend executing LDAP requests (PercentTimeInAD) to a user's calendar data. A value of 100 indicates that for every one-minute window, the user can spend 60 seconds of that time consuming the resource in question.

  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

A connection is held from the moment a request is received until a response is sent in its entirety to the requestor. If users attempt to make more concurrent requests than their policy allows, the new connection attempt fails. However, the existing connections remain valid.

    A valid value for this parameter is an integer from 0 through 2147483647 inclusive. The default value is 5. To indicate that the number of concurrent connections should be unthrottled (no limit), use the value $null.

    **Note**: We don't recommend setting this parameter to a large number or the value $null, because server performance might be negatively affected.

Destructive cmdlets are cmdlets that can make significant changes to user data and configuration settings in your Exchange organization. Throttling these cmdlets may help prevent accidental data loss. The following cmdlets are designated as destructive:

    - Remove-Mailbox
    - Remove-MailUser
    - Remove-Organization

  name: RcaSharedMaxConcurrency
  description: |+
    The RcaSharedMaxConcurrency parameter specifies how many concurrent connections all RPC Client Access users can have against an Exchange server at one time. A connection is held from the moment a request is received until the connection is closed or the connection is otherwise disconnected (for example, if users go offline). If there are more concurrent requests than the policy allows, new connection attempts fail. However, the existing connections remain valid.

    The default value is unlimited, which means the limit is controlled individually for each user by the RcaMaxConcurrency parameter.

description: |-
  By default, there is one default throttling policy named `GlobalThrottlingPolicy_<GUID>` with a throttling scope of Global. Microsoft Exchange Setup creates a default client throttling policy as part of the Client Access server role. You should not replace, re-create, or remove the existing default throttling policy. However, you can create additional throttling policies with the scope of Organization or Regular to change your user throttling settings. You can also edit policies with the scope of Organization and Regular that you've created using the Set-ThrottlingPolicy cmdlet.

  For more information about how to control how resources are consumed by individual users, see [User workload management in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/server-health/workload-management).

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you.
