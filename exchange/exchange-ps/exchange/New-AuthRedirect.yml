examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    New-AuthRedirect -AuthScheme Bearer -TargetURL https://mbx01.contoso.com
  description: |-
    This example creates an OAuth redirection object with the following settings:

    - AuthScheme: Bearer
    - TargetURL: `https://mbx01.contoso.com`
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="AuthScheme" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthScheme
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The AuthScheme parameter specifies the authentication scheme that's used by the authentication redirection object. Typically, this value is Bearer.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2010

- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TargetUrl
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The TargetUrl parameter specifies the FQDN of the Exchange Client Access Server that's responsible for processing the redirected OAuth authentication requests.

  defaultValue: None

  name: WhatIf

  Exchange 2010 Client Access servers don't support OAuth authentication requests. Use this cmdlet to redirect OAuth authentication requests to Exchange servers that are running later versions of Exchange. This cmdlet is only useful if your organization has Exchange 2010 Client Access servers.
