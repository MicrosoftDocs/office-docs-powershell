# Remove-DeviceConditionalAccessRule

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in Security & Compliance Center PowerShell. For more information, see [Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/scc-powershell).

Use the Remove-DeviceConditionalAccessRule cmdlet to remove mobile device conditional access rules from the Security & Compliance Center.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-DeviceConditionalAccessRule [-Identity] <PolicyIdParameter> [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
These are the cmdlets that are used for mobile device management in the Security & Compliance Center:

- DeviceTenantPolicy and DeviceTenantRule cmdlets: A policy that defines whether to block or allow mobile device access to Exchange Online email by unsupported devices that use Exchange ActiveSync only. This setting applies to all users in your organization. Both allow and block scenarios allow reporting for unsupported devices, and you can specify exceptions to the policy based on security groups.

- DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy and DeviceConditionalAccessRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device access to Microsoft 365 for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups. Unsupported devices are not allowed to enroll in mobile device management.

- DeviceConfigurationPolicy and DeviceConfigurationRule cmdlets: Policies that control mobile device settings for supported devices. These policies are applied to security groups.

- Get-DevicePolicy: Returns all mobile device management policies regardless of type (DeviceTenantPolicy, DeviceConditionalAccessPolicy or DeviceConfigurationPolicy).

You need to be assigned permissions in the Security & Compliance Center before you can use this cmdlet. For more information, see [Permissions in the Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-DeviceConditionalAccessRule "Secure Email{914f151c-394b-4da9-9422-f5a2f65dec30}"
```

This example removes the mobile device conditional access rule named Secure Email{914f151c-394b-4da9-9422-f5a2f65dec30}.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the mobile device conditional access rule that you want to view. The name of the rule uses the syntax \<Mobile device conditional access policy name\>{\<GUID value\>}. For example, Secure Email{914f151c-394b-4da9-9422-f5a2f65dec30}. You can find the name value by running the command: Get-DeviceConditionalAccessRule | Format-List Name.

```yaml
Type: PolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
