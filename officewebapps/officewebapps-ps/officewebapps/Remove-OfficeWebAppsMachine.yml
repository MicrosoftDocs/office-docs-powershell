  The Remove-OfficeWebAppsMachine cmdlet removes the current server from the Office Online Server farm.
  As part of this process, the cmdlet removes the web applications and shuts down the services that are related to Office Online Server.
  If you cannot run the Remove-OfficeWebAppsMachine cmdlet from the server that you want to remove, use the Repair-OfficeWebAppsFarm cmdlet from any other server in the Office Online farm.

  If the local server is designated as the master server in the Office Online Server farm, you cannot remove it from the farm until you assign a different server as master by using the Set-OfficeWebAppsMachine cmdlet, or until you remove all other servers from the farm.
