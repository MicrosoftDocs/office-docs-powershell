# Skype for Business cmdlet help reference

Welcome to the Skype for Business PowerShell cmdlet **Help** reference. The Skype for Business cmdlets provide the command line interface for server and service administration and management.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As you migrate to Microsoft Teams, you will find that some of the cmdlets in the Skype for Business Online module are also used for Microsoft Teams. To learn more about this, see: [Teams PowerShell Overview](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-powershell-overview).

Here, you will find all of the Skype for Business and relevant Microsoft Teams PowerShell **Help** topics. These topics are 'open source' and open for contributions. If you are interested in contributing to this content, go to the source GitHub repo and look through the README.

The repo is located here: <https://github.com/microsoftdocs/office-docs-powershell> and you can find the README displayed at the bottom of the page.
