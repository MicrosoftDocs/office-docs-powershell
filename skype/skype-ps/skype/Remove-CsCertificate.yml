  code: |-
    Remove-CsCertificate -Type WebServicesExternal
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 deletes all the WebServicesExternal certificates available to Skype for Business Server.
    If any of these certificates are currently being used, the `Remove-CsCertificate` cmdlet will ask you if you are sure you want to remove the certificate; you must respond to that prompt before the command can complete.
    To bypass the confirmation prompt, use the Force parameter:

    Remove-CsCertificate -Type WebServicesExternal -Force

  Skype for Business Server uses certificates as a way for servers and server roles to verify their identities; for example, an Edge Server uses certificates to verify that the computer it is communicating with really is a Front End Server and vice versa.
  In order to fully implement Skype for Business Server, you will need to have the appropriate certificates assigned to the appropriate server roles.

  The `Remove-CsCertificate` cmdlet provides a way for you to remove certificates currently in use by Skype for Business Server.
  The `Remove-CsCertificate` cmdlet does not actually delete the certificate itself; instead, it marks the certificate as no longer being available for use by Skype for Business Server, removes any certificate bindings and revokes access permissions to the certificate (assuming no other service is using the certificate).
  Among other things, this means that the certificate will no longer appear when you run the `Get-CsCertificate` cmdlet.

  To again use the certificate with Skype for Business Server you will need to reassign the certificate to Skype for Business Server by using the `Set-CsCertificate` cmdlet.

  If you try to remove a certificate that is currently in use, the `Remove-CsCertificate` cmdlet will be ask if you are sure that you want to remove the certificate; the certificate cannot be removed until you respond to that prompt.
  To bypass the prompt and silently delete a certificate even if it is currently in use, add the Force parameter to your command:

  Remove-CsCertificate -Type WebServicesExternal -Force
