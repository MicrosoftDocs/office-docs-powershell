# Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

The CsTeamsMeetingPolicy cmdlets enable administrators to control the type of meetings that users can create or the features that they can access while in a meeting. It also helps determine how meetings deal with anonymous or external users

Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy \[\[-Identity\] \<XdsIdentity\>\] \[-Tenant \<guid\>\] \[-LocalStore\] \[\<CommonParameters\>\]

Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy \[-Tenant \<guid\>\] \[-Filter \<string\>\] \[-LocalStore\] \[\<CommonParameters\>\]

## SYNTAX

```
Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy [-LocalStore] [[-Identity] <Object>] [-Tenant <Object>] [-Filter <Object>] [-AsJob]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The CsTeamsMeetingPolicy cmdlets enable administrators to control the type of meetings that users can create or the features that they can access while in a meeting. It also helps determine how meetings deal with anonymous or external users

Teams Meeting policies can be configured at the global and per-user scopes.
The Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy cmdlet enables you to return information about all the meeting policies that have been configured for use in your organization.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy
```

In Example 1, Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy is called without any additional parameters; this returns a collection of all the teams meeting policies configured for use in your organization.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity SalesPolicy
```

In Example 2, Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy is used to return the per-user meeting policy that has an Identity SalesPolicy.
Because identities are unique, this command will never return more than one item.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy | Where-Object {$_.AllowMeetNow -eq $True}
```

The preceding command returns a collection of all the meeting policies where the AllowMeetNow property is True.
To do this, Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy is first called without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the policies configured for use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those policies where the AllowMeetNow property is equal to True.
