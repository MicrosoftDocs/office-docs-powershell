# Set-CsLisSwitch

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a Location Information Server (LIS) switch, creates an association between a switch and a location (creating a new location if that location doesn't exist), or modifies an existing switch and its associated location.
The association between a switch and location is used in an Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) Enterprise Voice implementation to notify an emergency services operator of the caller's location.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

 [-StreetName <String>] [-StreetSuffix <String>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Enhanced 9-1-1 allows an emergency operator to identify the location of a caller without having to ask the caller for that information.
In the case where a caller is calling from a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connection, that information must be extracted based on various connection factors.
The VoIP administrator must configure a location map (called a wiremap) that will determine a caller's location.
This cmdlet allows the administrator to map physical locations to the network switch through which the client is connected.

The ChassisID parameter is the only required parameter for this cmdlet.
If you enter a ChassisID value that already exists, this cmdlet will update the location for that switch based on the location parameters that are supplied.
If the ChassisID does not exist, a new switch location will be created.

If a location with an address exactly matching the address parameters entered here (including null values) does not exist in the location database, a new address will be created based on the parameters entered with this cmdlet.
(You can retrieve a list of locations by calling the `Get-CsLisLocation` cmdlet.) The `Set-CsLisSwitch` cmdlet does not require or prompt for location parameters; you can create a switch entry without associating it with a location.
It's also possible to create an invalid location with this cmdlet.
A valid location consists of, at minimum, the Location, HouseNumber, StreetName, City, State and Country.
If you do not supply all of these parameters, calls that are received by the referenced switch may not contain the information required by the emergency operator (depending on whether valid settings are available for a subnet or wireless access point that can be used in place of switch settings).
It is recommended that you be as specific as possible with the location parameters and fill in as many as possible.

Note that switch entries can also be created by calling the `Set-CsLisPort` cmdlet.
If the `Set-CsLisPort` cmdlet is called with a ChassisID value that does not have an existing switch entry, that switch will be created.

It's important to note that these changes will take effect only if you have configured the MACResolverUrl property using the `New-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet or the `Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet.
The MACResolverUrl property specifies the URL for a web service that is capable of taking an IP address and determining the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the network card associated with that IP address.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsLisSwitch -ChassisID 99-99-99-99-99-99
```

Example 1 creates or updates a LIS switch location entry.
The command in this example includes only one (required) parameter: ChassisID.
The value of the ChassisID is the MAC address of the switch, in this case 99-99-99-99-99-99.

Notice that this example does not include any address information.
It's possible to create a switch entry on the Location Information Server without associating it with an address.
However, emergency calls routed through this switch may not (depending on subnet or port locations that have been defined) contain enough information for the emergency operator to identify a location.

IMPORTANT: If a LIS switch location with this ChassisID already exists, it will be replaced by the values in this command.
That means that if this switch were associated with an address (a physical location), that association would no longer exist because we didn't include any location information in this command.
The location will still exist in the location database, but it will not be associated with this switch.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Set-CsLisSwitch -ChassisID 99-99-99-99-99-99 -Location "30/1000" -HouseNumber 1234 -PreDirectional NE -StreetName First -StreetSuffix Avenue -City Redmond -State WA -Country US -PostalCode 99999
```

Example 2 updates the switch created in Example 1 by adding address information.
(This is actually deleting the existing entry and replacing it with this new entry.) If the address does not exist in the location database, this cmdlet will create that location.


## PARAMETERS

### -ChassisID
The Media Access Control (MAC) address of the network switch.
This value must be in the form nn-nn-nn-nn-nn-nn, such as 12-34-56-78-90-ab, or in the form of an IP address.
If an entry with the specified ChassisID value does not exist, a new switch location will be created.
If an entry with the specified ChassisID does exist, that entry will be replaced.
