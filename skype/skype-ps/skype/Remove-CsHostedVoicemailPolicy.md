# Remove-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Removes a hosted voice mail policy.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-Tenant <Guid>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet removes a policy that specifies how to route unanswered calls to the user to a hosted Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) service.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Remove-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond
```

This command removes the hosted voice mail policy for the ExRedmond per-user policy.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Filter tag* | Remove-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy
```

The command in Example 2 removes all per-user hosted voice mail policies.
The command starts by calling the `Get-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy` cmdlet with a Filter of tag*, which will retrieve all policies defined as per-user policies.
That set of policies is then piped to the `Remove-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy` cmdlet, which deletes each one.
