    Remove-CsAnnouncement -Identity "ApplicationServer:Redmond.litwareinc.com/1951f734-c80f-4fb2-965d-51807c792b90"
  description: |-
    Example 1 removes the announcement that has the Identity "ApplicationServer:Redmond.litwareinc.com/1951f734-c80f-4fb2-965d-51807c792b90".
    Because Identities must be unique, this command will remove, at most, a single announcement.

  code: |-
    Remove-CsAnnouncement -Identity "ApplicationServer:Redmond.litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    In Example 2, all the announcements that have been applied to the service ApplicationServer:Redmond.litwareinc.com are deleted.
    To do this, the `Remove-CsAnnouncement` cmdlet is called along with the Identity parameter.
    Specifying the parameter value "ApplicationServer:Redmond.litwareinc.com" (without the appended GUID that identifies a unique announcement) removes all the announcements configured for the specified service.

description: |-
  An organization can own phone numbers that are not assigned to users or phones, but that are still valid numbers that can be called.
  By default when someone dials one of those numbers, that person will receive a busy signal and the call may result in an error returned to the SIP client.
  By applying announcement settings to unassigned numbers, administrators have the option of playing a message, returning a busy signal, or redirecting the call.
  This cmdlet removes one or more of these announcement settings.

  If you attempt to remove an announcement that is associated with an unassigned number range, by default you'll receive a prompt asking if you really want to remove the announcement.
  If you delete the announcement, the AnnouncementName property of that range will be displayed as Null and no announcement will be played when those numbers are reached, only a busy signal will be heard.
  However, the AnnouncementId property value (the GUID of the Announcement that was removed) will remain visible.
