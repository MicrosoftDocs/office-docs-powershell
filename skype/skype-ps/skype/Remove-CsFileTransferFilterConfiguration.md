# Remove-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Removes the specified instant message file transfer filter configuration.
(Instant message file transfer filter settings are used to block a user's ability to transfer certain types of files within an instant message.) This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
When sending instant messages, users can attach and send files to the other participants in the conversation.
Skype for Business Server can be configured so that files with certain extensions--typically extensions of file types that could potentially prove harmful--are not allowed to be sent using a Skype for Business Server client.

The `Remove-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration` cmdlet enables you to delete a file transfer filter configuration.
For configurations at the site scope, the `Remove-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration` cmdlet will remove the configuration; in turn, the users on the site will automatically inherit the global file transfer filter configuration.
The `Remove-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration` cmdlet can also be run against the global configuration.
In that case, however, the global configuration will not be removed; instead, all the property values in that configuration will be reset to their default values.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Remove-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond
```

In Example 1, the `Remove-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration` cmdlet is used to remove the file transfer filter configuration that has the Identity site:Redmond.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration -Filter site:* | Remove-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration
```

In Example 2, all the file transfer filter configurations at the site scope are removed.
To carry out this task, the command first uses the `Get-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration` cmdlet and the Filter parameter to return all the configurations at the site scope.
The filter value "site:*" tells the `Get-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration` cmdlet to return only those configurations that have an Identity that begins with the string value "site:".
The filtered collection of configurations is then piped to the `Remove-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration` cmdlet, which deletes each item in the collection.


### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.Enabled -eq $False} | Remove-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration
```

Example 3 shows you how you can remove all the file transfer filter configurations that are currently disabled.
To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration` cmdlet to return a collection of all the file transfer filter configurations currently in use in the organization.
That information is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which selects only those file transfer filter configurations where the Enabled property is equal to (-eq) False ($False).
That filtered collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsFileTransferFilterConfiguration` cmdlet, which proceeds to remove each item in the filtered collection.
