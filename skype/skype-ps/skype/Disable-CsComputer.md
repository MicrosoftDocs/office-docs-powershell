# Disable-CsComputer

## SYNOPSIS
Disables a service or server role that has been removed from a computer running Skype for Business Server.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Disable-CsComputer [-Scorch] [-GlobalCatalog <Fqdn>] [-Report <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [-GlobalSettingsDomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Removing a service or server role from a computer does not automatically update the Skype for Business Server topology.
Instead, that service or role must be disabled before the changes are fully updated in the topology.
The Disable-CsComputer cmdlet provides a way for administrators to disable any services or server roles that have been removed from the local computer.

Unless you use the Scorch parameter, the Disable-CsComputer cmdlet does not uninstall the Skype for Business Server software; instead, it simply stops the computer from functioning in its previously assigned role.

You must be a local administrator and a member of the domain in order to run the Disable-CsComputer cmdlet locally.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Disable-CsComputer
```

The command shown in Example 1 disables the local computer.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Disable-CsComputer -Report C:\Logs\Disable.html
```

The command shown in Examples 2 also disables the local computer.
In addition to disabling the computer, however, this command records information about the success (or failure) of that task in the file C:\Logs\Disable.html.
This log file is generated by adding the Report parameter followed by the path to the log file where you want the information recorded.
