- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------'

- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsUser -OU "ou=Finance,ou=North America,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Grant-CsVoicePolicy -PolicyName VoicePolicyRedmond
  description: |-
    This example assigns the voice policy with the Identity VoicePolicyRedmond to all users in the Finance OU: OU=Finance,OU=NorthAmerica,DC=litwareinc,DC=com.
    The first part of the command calls the Get-CsUser cmdlet to retrieve all users enabled for Skype for Business Server from the specified OU.
    This collection of users is then piped to the Grant-CsVoicePolicy cmdlet, which assigns the policy VoicePolicyRedmond to each of these users.

    The Identity (unique identifier) of the user to whom the policy is being assigned.

    User identities can be specified by using one of four formats: 1) The user's SIP address; 2) the user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (for example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).

    Note that you can use the asterisk (\*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
    For example, the Identity "* Smith" would return all the users with the last name Smith.

uid: SkypeForBusiness.Grant-CsVoicePolicy
name: Grant-CsVoicePolicy
description: |-
  This cmdlet assigns an existing per-user voice policy to a user.
  Voice policies are used to manage such Enterprise Voice-related features as simultaneous ringing (the ability to have a second phone ring each time someone calls your office phone) and call forwarding.
  Use this cmdlet to assign the settings that enable and disable these features for a specific user.

  You can check whether a user has been granted a per-user voice policy by calling a command in this format: `Get-CsUser "<user name>" | Select-Object VoicePolicy.`
  For example:

  `Get-CsUser "Ken Myer" | Select-Object VoicePolicy`

      NOTE - For accounts hosted in Skype for Business Online, it is not possible to grant a voice policy via PowerShell. In this scenario, the voice policy is automatically granted based on user licensing.
