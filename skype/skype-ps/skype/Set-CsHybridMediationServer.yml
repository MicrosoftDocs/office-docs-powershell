description: |-
  The `Set-CsHybridMediationServer` cmdlet provides FQDN settings for users.
  Use this command to register mediation serviers from on-prem on O365 and point them to access proxy (Edge server) from on-prem.
  Then the existing Skype for Business online call routing mechanism can establish the conference.

  This cmdlet will set the Edge server Access Proxy external FQDN as the hosting provider of the user whose name equals to the FDQN parameter.
  Users must be retrieved by their identity and they cannot already have assigned licenses.
