# Test-CsMcxConference

## SYNOPSIS
Tests the ability of three users to participate in a Skype for Business Server Mobility Service conference.
The Mobility Service enables users of mobile phones such as iPhones and Windows Phones to do such things as exchange instant messages and presence information; store and retrieve voice mail internally instead of with their wireless provider; and take advantage of Skype for Business Server capabilities such as Call via Work and dial-out conferencing.
This cmdlet was introduced in the cumulative update for Lync Server 2010: November 2011.


## SYNTAX

```
Test-CsMcxConference [-TargetFqdn] <String> -Authentication <AuthenticationMechanism>
 -OrganizerCredential <PSCredential> -OrganizerSipAddress <String> -User2Credential <PSCredential>
 -User2SipAddress <String> -UserCredential <PSCredential> -UserSipAddress <String> [-Force]
 [-OutLoggerVariable <String>] [-OutVerboseVariable <String>] [-RegistrarPort <Int32>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Mobility Service extends many of the capabilities of Skype for Business Server to mobile devices such as Apple iPhones, Windows Phone, Android phones, and Nokia phones.
Among other things, users can use these phones to exchange instant message and presence information, and to receive notifications of new voice mails.
Thanks to the push notification service (Apple Push Notification Service and Microsoft Push Notification Service, users who have iPhones or Windows Phones can receive these notifications even if Skype for Business is running in the background.
The Mobility Service also provides the opportunity for organizations to enable Call via Work.
With Call via Work, users can make a call from their mobile phone and make it appear as though the call originated from their work phone; for example, Caller ID systems will see the user's work number instead of his or her mobile phone number.

The `Test-CsMcxConference` cmdlet is used to determine whether or not a set of three users are able to participate in a conference by using the Mobility Service.
Note that running this cmdlet does not require the use of mobile phones nor does it actually create a real conference.
Instead, the cmdlet verifies that the three users are able to log on to Skype for Business Server and that the Mobility Service is able to make the connections required to conduct and conference.
The cmdlet also verifies that the conference organizer is able to send an instant message to the other two conference participants.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Exmple 1 --------------------------
```
$organizerCred = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

$user1Cred = Get-Credential "litwareinc\packerman"

$user2Cred = Get-Credential "litwareinc\adelaney"

Test-CsMcxConference -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Authentication Negotiate -OrganizerSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -OrganizerCredential $organizerCred -UserSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -UserCredential $user1Cred -User2SipAddress "sip:adelaney@litwareinc.com" -User2Credential $user2Cred
```

The commands shown in Example 1 verify whether a Mobility Service conference can be conducted using three user accounts: Ken Myer (the meeting organizer), Pilar Ackerman, and Aidan Delaney.
In order to run this test, the first thing that must be done is to create credentials objects for each user account.
Those objects are created in the first three lines of code, and stored in the variables $organizerCred (Ken Myer), $user1Cred (Pilar Ackerman), and $user2Cred (Aidan Delaney).

After the credentials objects have been created, you can then call the `Test-CsMcxConference` cmdlet, making sure to specify the target Registrar pool (atl-cs-001.litwareinc,com), the authentication type (Negotiate), and the SIP addresses and credentials of the three user accounts acting as conference participants.
