  description: |+

    (In other words, an uppercase "A" will be treated as a different character than a lowercase "a".) By default, searches are not case sensitive.

  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Keywords that can be used to help identify the messages to be deleted.
    For example, to search for all messages that include the keyword "Fabrikam" use this syntax:

    `-Filter "Fabrikam"`

    To search for multiple keywords, put all the keywords in a single string, separated by using blank spaces:

    `-Filter "Fabrikam Contoso TailspinToys"`

    By default, the `Remove-CsPersistentChatMessage` cmdlet will look for messages using all the specified keywords.
    To look for messages using any one of the provided keywords, use the MatchClause parameter and set the parameter value to "Or".

    * Or (A message containing one or more of the specified keywords will be considered a match)
    * Exact (Messages must exactly match the specified phrase, including the word order, in order to be a match)

    For example, this syntax searches for messages that have the exact phrase "For internal use only) in the message text:

    `-Filter "For internal use only" -MatchClause "Exact"`

description: |-
  The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
  Conversations can be based around specific topics and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
  Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

  Persistent Chat discussions take the form of messages posted in individual chat rooms; chat rooms are discussion forums based on specific topics.
  By design, messages posted in a chat room remain there forever; at any time, users can return to the room and review all the messages that have been previously posted.

  However, there might be times when administrators need to remove messages from a chat room; for example, perhaps a user posted a series of messages with erroneous information regarding the forthcoming company meeting.
  The `Remove-CsPersisentChatMessage` cmdlet enables administrators to remove a single chat message, or to remove an entire set of chat messages based on criteria such as the user who posted the message or keywords found in that message.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Remove-CsPersistentChatMessage` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
