# Set-CsUserServer

## SYNOPSIS
Enables you to modify an existing User Services pool.
Among other things, the User Services pool provides presence information and helps to manage conferences.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Set-CsUserServer [[-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity>] [-ConferenceServer <String>]
 [-McuFactorySipPort <UInt16>] [-UserDatabase <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [-ConfDirManagementWcfTcpPort <UInt16>] [-UserPinManagementWcfHttpPort <UInt16>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
User Services is a catch-all component that performs a number of key Skype for Business Server roles; for example, User Services provides presence information; helps to manage conferences (through the Focus and Focus Factory); handles user authorization and user-level routing and serves as the primary interface to the back-end database.
User Services also assists with provisioning user accounts.

Because of this, it is important for administrators to know exactly how their User Services pools have been configured and, if necessary, to modify those configurations.
You can retrieve information about your User Services pools by using this command:

`Get-CsService -UserServer`

Likewise, you can use the `Set-CsUserServer` cmdlet to make changes to any of these pools.
The `Set-CsUserServer` cmdlet enables administrators to change the user database and/or the conferencing server associated with a pool.
The cmdlet also lets you modify the port used for connections to the Focus Factory.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Set-CsUserServer -Identity "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -McuFactorySipPort 445
```

The command shown in Example 1 changes the McuFactorySipPort for a single User Services pool: the pool with the Identity `UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
In this example, the port is changed to 445.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Get-CsService -UserServer | ForEach-Object {Set-CsUserServer -Identity $_.Identity -McuFactorySipPort 445}
```

The command shown in Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1.
In this case, however, the McuFactorySipPort is modified for all the User Services pools in the organization.
To do this, the command starts off by using the `Get-CsService` cmdlet and the UserServer parameter to return a collection of all the User Services pool currently in use.
This collection is then piped to the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet, which takes each pool in the collection and sets the McuFactorySipPort to 445.
The data must be piped to the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet because the `Set-CsUserServer` cmdlet cannot accept pipelined data itself.


## PARAMETERS
