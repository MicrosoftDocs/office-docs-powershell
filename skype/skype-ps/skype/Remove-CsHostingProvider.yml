### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Removes one or more of the hosting providers currently in use in your organization.
  A hosting provider is a third-party organization that provides instant messaging, presence and related services for a domain that you would like to federate with.
  Hosting providers differ from public providers (such as Yahoo!, MSN and AOL) in that their services are not offered to the general public.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Remove-CsHostingProvider -Identity "Fabrikam.com"
  description: |-
    The command show in Example 1 deletes the hosting provider with the Identity Fabrikam.com.
    After the hosting provider has been deleted, federation with Fabrikam.com (and any domains associated with Fabrikam.com) will be terminated.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsHostingProvider | Remove-CsHostingProvider
  description: |-
    Example 2 deletes all of the hosting providers configured for use in the organization.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsHostingProvider` cmdlet to return a collection of all the hosting providers currently in use.
    That collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsHostingProvider` cmdlet, which deletes each item in the collection.
    When this command completes there will no longer be any hosting providers configured for use.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsHostingProvider -Filter "*Fabrikam*" | Remove-CsHostingProvider
  description: |-
    Example 3 deletes any hosting providers where the string value "Fabrikam" appears somewhere in the provider Identity.
    To carry out this task, the command first calls the `Get-CsHostingProvider` cmdlet and the Filter parameter; the filter value "*Fabrikam*" limits the returned data to any hosting providers that have "Fabrikam" somewhere in the Identity.
    For example, this command returns such providers as Fabrikam.com, Fabrikam.net and FabrikamUsers.com.
    The filtered collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsHostingProvider` cmdlet, which deletes each item in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsHostingProvider | Where-Object {$_.VerificationLevel -ne "AlwaysVerifiable"} | Remove-CsHostingProvider
  description: |-
    In Example 4, all the hosting providers where the verification level is set to anything other than AlwaysVerifiable are deleted.
    This is done by first calling the `Get-CsHostingProvider` cmdlet without any additional parameters; that returns a collection of all the hosting providers configured for use in the organization.
    The resulting collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those providers where the VerificationLevel property is not equal to AlwaysVerifiable.
    The filtered collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsHostingProvider` cmdlet, which removes each provider in that collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 5 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsHostingProvider | Where-Object {$_.Enabled -eq $False} | Remove-CsHostingProvider
  description: |-
    Example 5 removes all the hosting providers that are current disabled.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsHostingProvider` cmdlet to return a collection of all the hosting providers configured for use in the organization.
    This collection is piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those providers that are disabled; that is, only those providers where the Enabled property is equal to False.
    The filtered collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsHostingProvider` cmdlet, which deletes each of the disabled hosting providers.

  Federation is a means by which two organizations can set up a trust relationship that facilitates communication between the two groups.
  When a federation has been established, users in the two organizations can send each other instant messages, subscribe for presence notifications and otherwise communicate with one another using SIP applications such as Skype for Business.
  Skype for Business Server allows for three types of federation: 1) direct federation between your organization and another; 2) federation between your organization and a public provider and 3) federation between your organization and a third-party hosting provider.

  A hosting provider is an organization which provides SIP communication services for other organizations; for example, Fabrikam, Inc.
  might host users from Contoso, Northwind Traders and Wingtip Toys.
  When you establish a federation relationship with a hosting provider, you effectively establish federation with any organization hosted by that provider.
  For example, if you federate with Fabrikam, your users will be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with users from Contoso, Northwind Traders and Wingtip Toys.

  Hosting providers are also used in split domain scenarios.
  In a split domain scenario, some of your users have accounts hosted on-premises (that is, hosted on your local implementation of Skype for Business Server).
  Other users have their accounts maintained off-premises by the third-party hosting provider.
  Federating with the hosting provider enables on-premises and off-premises users to communicate with one another.

  In order to federate with a third-party hosting provider, you need to create and enable a new hosting provider.
  (In addition, the third-party provider will need to create a federation relationship with you.) If you decide later to terminate this relationship, you can use the `Remove-CsHostingProvider` cmdlet to delete the hosting provider.
  When you delete a hosting provider, the provider is removed from your list of federated partners; at that point, the only way to re-establish the relationship is to recreate the provider.
  If you want to temporarily suspend a relationship, use the `Disable-CsHostingProvider` cmdlet instead.
  When a hosting provider is disabled, the provider is not deleted from the list of federated partners; instead, the provider is simply marked as disabled and communication between your organization and that provider is disabled.
  To re-establish the relationship, you can use the `Enable-CsHostingProvider` cmdlet to re-enable the provider.
