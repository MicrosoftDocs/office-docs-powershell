description: |-
  This cmdlet removes an existing voice policy.
  Voice policies are used to manage such Enterprise Voice-related features as simultaneous ringing (the ability to have a second phone ring each time someone calls your office phone) and call forwarding.
  This cmdlet can also be used to remove the global voice policy.
  In that case, however, the policy will not actually be removed; instead, the policy settings will simply be reset to their default values.
