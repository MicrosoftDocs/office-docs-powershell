# Import-CsLegacyConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS

The Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet enables you to import a number of configuration settings from Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 or Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 to Skype for Business Server.
This helps provide interoperability between Skype for Business Server and your earlier installation of Office Communications Server 2007 R2 or Office Communications Server 2007.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Import-CsLegacyConfiguration [-ReplaceExisting] [-Force] [-Report <String>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet is used in conjunction with the Merge-CsLegacyTopology cmdlet to enable organizations to migrate from a previous version of Office Communications Server (either Office Communications Server 2007 R2 or Office Communications Server 2007) to Skype for Business Server.
The Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet is used to import voice policies; location profiles (for instance, dial plans); voice routes; voice normalization rules; meeting policies; external access policies; archiving policies; presence policies; Communicator Web Access URL settings; and dial-in conferencing access numbers.

Before you can run the Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet, you must first install the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Backward Compatibility interfaces package; this application is installed by running OCSWMIBC.msi.
After installing the Compatibility interfaces package, you should next run the Merge-CsLegacyTopology cmdlet.
When the Merge-CsLegacyTopology cmdlet finishes, you should publish the merged topology by using Topology Builder.
After publishing the merged topology, you can then call the Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet.
The Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet uses WMI to read legacy data from the earlier version of Office Communications Server.
The Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet then takes the retrieved data and creates corresponding objects in Skype for Business Server.
For example, for each voice policy found in your installation of Office Communications Server, a corresponding voice policy will be created in your new installation of Skype for Business Server.

The Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet should be re-run whenever you make changes to any of the following Office Communications Server items: voice policies; location profiles; voice routes; voice normalization rules; meeting policies; external access policies; archiving policies; presence policies; Communicator Web Access URL settings; and dial-in conferencing access numbers.
By default, only new items added to your Office Communications Server topology will be imported when you re-run the Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet.
To import modified objects you must do two things.
First, confirm that no changes have been made to the corresponding item (for example, a voice policy) in the Skype for Business Server copy of the configuration.
Second, run the Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet along with the ReplaceExisting parameter; this causes the Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet to import modified objects and to overwrite the corresponding object currently in Skype for Business Server.
Note that objects deleted from the Communications Server 2007 R2 topology do not result in corresponding deletions in Skype for Business Server.
You will need to manually remove those in Skype for Business Server.

It's important to know that the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet relies on information imported by the Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet.
That means that, when running the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet, you might receive an error message telling you that you must run the Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet before proceeding.
If that happens you must re-run the Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet before you will be able to move the legacy user.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

Import-CsLegacyConfiguration
```

The command shown in Example 1 merges voice policies and other settings from Communications Server 2007 or Communications Server 2007 R2 with an installation of Skype for Business Server.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- 
```

Import-CsLegacyConfiguration -ReplaceExisting
```

The command shown in Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1.
In this case, however, the ReplaceExisting parameter is included.
This parameter instructs the cmdlet to use the imported data to resolve name collisions.
For example, suppose you try to import a voice route named LocalRoute, and a voice route by that name already exists in your Skype for Business Server installation.
Because you included the ReplaceExisting parameter, the Skype for Business Server route will be replaced by the voice route being imported.


## PARAMETERS

### -ReplaceExisting

If present, this parameter instructs the Import-CsLegacyConfiguration cmdlet to overwrite any previously imported policies or settings that have changed since the last time the cmdlet was run.
