summary: |-
  The TeamsCallParkPolicy controls whether or not users are able to leverage the call park feature in Microsoft Teams.  Call park allows enterprise voice customers to place a call on hold and then perform a number of actions on that call: transfer to another department, retrieve via the same phone, or retrieve via a different Teams phone.  The Remove-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy cmdlet lets delete a custom policy that has been configured in your organization.

    Unique identifier for the client policy to be removed.
    To "remove" the global policy, use the following syntax: `-Identity global`.
    (Note that the global policy cannot actually be removed.  Instead, all the properties in that policy will be reset to their default values.) To remove a per-user policy, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity "SalesDepartmentPolicy"`.
    You cannot use wildcards when specifying a policy Identity.
