## DESCRIPTION

The Move-CsUser cmdlet enables you to move a user account enabled for Skype for Business Server from one Registrar pool to another.
The Move-CsUser cmdlet affects only the user's Skype for Business Server account location; it does not move the user's Active Directory account to a new organizational unit (OU) or other new location.

If Skype for Business Server is coexisting with Office Communications Server 2007 R2 or Office Communications Server 2007, then the Move-CsUser cmdlet can used to move a user back from Skype for Business Server to the legacy installation of Office Communications Server.
To move a user back to Office Communications Server, assign the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the legacy pool to the Target parameter.
If you do this, keep in mind that users moved back to Office Communications Server will likely experience functionality and data loss; that's because Skype for Business Server has many more capabilities than either Office Communications Server 2007 or Office Communications Server 2007 R2.
Users moved back might also need to install previous versions of their client software, and may be required to reschedule meetings that were created when their user accounts were homed on Skype for Business Server.

To move users from Communications Server 2007 or Communications Server 2007 R2 to Skype for Business Server, use the Move-CsLegacyUser cmdlet.
The Move-CsUser cmdlet is designed to move users from one Skype for Business Server to another Skype for Business Server pool, or to move a user from a Skype for Business Server pool to an Office Communications Server pool.
Move-CsLegacyUser moves users from Office Communications Server to Skype for Business Server.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

Move-CsUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

In Example 1, the Move-CsUser cmdlet is used to move the user account with the Identity Pilar Ackerman to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsUser -OU "ou=Finance,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Move-CsUser -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

In Example 2 all the user accounts in the Finance organizational unit (OU) are moved to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To carry out this task, the command first uses the Get-CsUser cmdlet and the OU parameter to retrieve a collection of all the user accounts in the Finance OU.
After the data has been retrieved, the information is piped to the Move-CsUser cmdlet, which moves each account in the collection to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- 
```

Move-CsUser -Identity "Pilar Ackerman" -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Force
```

In Example 3, the Move-CsUser cmdlet is used to move the user account with the Identity Pilar Ackerman to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In addition, the Force parameter is used to ensure that only the account itself is moved; user data associated with that account (such conferences that Pilar has scheduled) will not be moved but will, instead, be discarded.
The Force parameter should only be used if you have tried calling the Move-CsUser cmdlet without the parameter and that move failed.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Indicates the Identity of the user account to be moved.
User Identities can be specified using one of four formats: 1) the user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (for example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).
User Identities can also be referenced by using the user's Active Directory distinguished name.

You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
For example, the Identity "* Smith" returns all the users with who have a display name that ends with the string value " Smith".

```yaml
Type: UserIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All), Identity
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Target

The FQDN (for example, atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com) of the Registrar pool where the user account should be moved.
In addition to a Registrar pool, the Target can also be the FQDN of a legacy Office Communications Server Front End Server or a hosting provider.
Any accounts moved to a hosting provider will lose all their associated user data.
For example, any conferences the user has scheduled will be deleted and will not be available in Skype for Business Online.



```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
Enables you to connect to the specified domain controller in order to retrieve contact information.
To connect to a particular domain controller, include the DomainController parameter followed by the computer name (for example, atl-cs-001) or its FQDN (for example, atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com).

```yaml
Type: Fqdn

Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ProxyPool

This parameter is used only for Skype for Business Server.
It should not be used with an on-premises implementation of Skype for Business Server.



```yaml

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
If present, moves the user account but deletes any associated user data (such as conferences that the user has scheduled).
If not present, both the account and the associated data are moved.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter

Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru
Enables you to pass a user object through the pipeline that represents the user account being moved.
By default, the Move-CsUser cmdlet does not pass objects through the pipeline.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Enables you to bypass the confirmation prompt that would otherwise appear when you attempt to move a user.
To bypass the confirmation prompt, include the Confirm parameter using this syntax:

`-Confirm:$False`

If you would prefer to have the confirmation prompt then use this syntax:

`-Confirm`

```yaml

```

### -Credential

Enables you to run the Move-CsUser cmdlet under alternate credentials.
This might be required if the account you used to log on to Windows does not have the necessary privileges required to work with user objects.

To use the Credential parameter you must first create a PSCredential object using the Get-Credential cmdlet.
For details, see the Get-Credential cmdlet help topic.



```yaml
