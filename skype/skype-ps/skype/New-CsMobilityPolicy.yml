### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a new mobility policy at the site or the per-user scope.
  Mobility policies determine whether or not a user can use Skype for Business Mobile.
  These policies also manage a user's ability to employ Call via Work, a feature that enables users to make and receive phone calls on their mobile phone by using their work phone number instead of their mobile phone number.
  Mobility policies can also be used to require Wi-Fi connections when making or receiving IP video/screen share calls.
  This cmdlet was introduced in the cumulative update for Lync Server 2010: November 2011.

  The following parameters are not applicable to Skype for Business Online: AllowAutomaticPstnFallback, AllowCustomerExperienceImprovementProgram, AllowExchangeConnectivity, AllowSaveCallLogs, Description, EncryptAppData, Force, Identity, InMemory, PipelineVariable, RequireIntune, Tenant, and VoiceSettings
module: SkypeForBusiness

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsMobilityPolicy -Identity site:Redmond -EnableOutsideVoice $False
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 creates a new mobility policy for the Redmond site, and disables the use of Call via Work for any users affected by the policy.
    This is done by setting the EnableOutsideVoice parameter to False.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $x = New-CsMobilityPolicy -Identity site:Redmond -InMemory

    $x.EnableOutsideVoice = $False

    Set-CsMobilityPolicy -Instance $x
  description: |-
    Example 2 demonstrates how you can create a new mobility policy in memory, modify a property value for that policy, and then use the Set-CsMobilityPolicy cmdlet to turn the virtual policy into an actual Lync Server mobility policy.
    To do this, the command first uses the New-CsMobilityPolicy cmdlet and the InMemory parameter to create a new policy for the Redmond site.
    Because the InMemory parameter causes this policy to exists in memory only, the resulting object must be stored in variable ($x).

    In command 2, the EnableOutsideVoice property for the virtual policy is set to False.
    After that, command 3 uses the Set-CsMobilityPolicy cmdlet and the Instance parameter to write the changes to Lync Server and create a mobility policy for the Redmond site.
    If you do not call the Set-CsMobilityPolicy cmdlet, the policy will not be created, and, in fact, will disappear as soon as you end your Windows PowerShell command-line interface session or delete the variable $x.

    Unique Identity to be assigned to the policy.

    For example, use this syntax to create a new policy for the Redmond site:

    `-Identity site:Redmond`

    To create a new per-user policy, use an Identity similar to this:

    `-Identity SalesDepartmentPolicy`

    Note that you cannot create a new global policy; if you want to make changes to the global policy, use the Set-CsMobilityPolicy cmdlet instead.
    Likewise, you cannot create a new site or per-user policy if a policy with that Identity already exists.
    If you need to make changes to an existing policy, use the Set-CsMobilityPolicy cmdlet.

description: |-
  Skype for Business Mobile is a client application that enables users to run Skype for Business on their mobile phones.
  Call via Work provides a way for users to make calls on their mobile phone and yet have it appear as though the call originated from their work phone number instead of their mobile phone number.
  Users who have been enabled for Call via Work can achieve this either by dialing directly from their mobile phone or by using the dial-out conferencing option.
  With dial-out conferencing, a user effectively asks the Skype for Business Server Mobility Service server to make a call for them.
  The server will set up the call, and then call the user back on their mobile phone.
  After the user has answered, the server will then dial the party being called.
  Both of these capabilities can be managed by using mobility policies.

  With Skype for Business Server, mobile devices can make or receive phone calls by using either the standard cellular phone network.
  or by using Wi-Fi connections.

  When you install Skype for Business Server, you will have a single, global mobility policy that applies to all your users.
  However, administrators can use the New-CsMobilityPolicy cmdlet to create custom policies at either the site or the per-user scope.

  Note that two different properties must be configured in order to enable Call via Work.
  The first property, EnableOutsideVoice, determines whether or not Call via Work is enabled; the second, EnableMobility, determines whether or not users are allowed to use Skype for Business Mobile.
  Both of these properties must be set to true before a user can take advantage of Call via Work.
  If EnableMobility is set to True and EnableOutsideVoice is set to False, the user can run Skype for Business Server Mobile but will not be able to use Call via Work.
  If EnableMobility is set to False and EnableOutsideVoice is set to True the user will not be able to run Skype for Business Mobile.
  In turn, that means that the user will not be able to use Call via Work, regardless of the value of the EnableOutsideVoice property.

  To use Call via Work, users must be managed by a voice policy that allows simultaneous ringing.
