  The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
  Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
  Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

  Persistent Chat discussions take the form of messages posted in individual chat rooms; chat rooms are discussion forums based on specific topics.
  By design, messages posted in a chat room remain there forever; at any time, users can return to the room and review all the messages that have been previously posted.

  The New-CsPersistentChatRoom cmdlet enables administrators to create new Persistent Chat chat rooms.
  Note that not all the properties of a chat room are available using the New-CsPersistentChatRoom cmdlet; for example, you cannot assign chat room Managers or Presenters by using this cmdlet.
  To assign Managers or Presenters, you must create the chat room, then make those assignments using the Set-CsPersistentChatRoom cmdlet.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: To create a new Persistent Chat chat room using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click Persistent Chat, click Room, and then click New.
