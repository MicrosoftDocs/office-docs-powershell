# Test-CsPersistentChatMessage

## SYNOPSIS
Verifies whether or not a pair of users can exchange messages using the Persistent Chat service (formerly known as the Group Chat service).
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.

## DESCRIPTION
The `Test-CsPersistentChatMessage` cmdlet verifies that a pair of test users is able to exchange messages using the Persistent Chat service.
To do this, the cmdlet logs the two users on to Skype for Business Server, connects the users to a persistent Chat room, exchanges a pair of messages, then exits the chat room and logs off the two users.
Note that calls to this cmdlet will fail if you have not created any chat rooms or if the two test user accounts have not been assigned a Persistent Chat policy that gives them access to the Persistent Chat service.

Skype for Business Server Control Panel : The functions carried out by the `Test-CsPersistentChatMessage` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
$cred1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"

$cred2 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

Test-CsPersistentChatMessage -TargetFqdn atl-persistentchat-001.litwareinc.com -SenderSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $cred1 -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -ReceiverCredential $cred2
```

The commands shown in Example 2 test the ability of a pair of users (litwareinc\pilar and litwareinc\kenmyer) to log on to Skype for Business Server and then exchange messages using the Persistent Chat service.
To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell command-line interface credential object containing the name and password of the user Pilar Ackerman.
(Because the logon name, litwareinc\pilar, has been included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box only requires the administrator to enter the password for the Pilar Ackerman account.) The resulting credentials object is then stored in a variable named $cred1.
The second command does the same thing, this time returning a credential object for the Ken Myer account.

With the credential objects in hand, the third command determines whether or not these two users can log on to Skype for Business Server and exchange messages using Persistent Chat.
To carry out this task, the `Test-CsPersistentChatMessage` cmdlet is called, along with the following parameters: TargetFqdn (the FQDN of the Registrar pool); SenderSipAddress (the SIP address for the first test user); SenderCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for this same user); ReceiverSipAddress (the SIP address for the other test user); and ReceiverCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for the other test user).


## PARAMETERS

### -ReceiverCredential
User credential object for the first of the two user accounts to be tested.
The value passed to ReceiverCredential should be an object reference obtained by using the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.
For example, this code returns a credentials object for the user litwareinc\pilar and stores that object in a variable named $y:

`$y = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"`

You need to supply the user password when running this command.

The receiver credential is not required if you are running the test under the health monitoring configuration settings for the pool.

### -SenderCredential
User credential object for the second of the two user accounts to be tested.
