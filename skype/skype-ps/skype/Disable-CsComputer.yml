uid: SkypeForBusiness.Disable-CsComputer
name: Disable-CsComputer
description: |-
  Removing a service or server role from a computer does not automatically update the Skype for Business Server topology.
  Instead, that service or role must be disabled before the changes are fully updated in the topology.
  The Disable-CsComputer cmdlet provides a way for administrators to disable any services or server roles that have been removed from the local computer.

  Unless you use the Scorch parameter, the Disable-CsComputer cmdlet does not uninstall the Skype for Business Server software; instead, it simply stops the computer from functioning in its previously assigned role.

  You must be a local administrator and a member of the domain in order to run the Disable-CsComputer cmdlet locally.
