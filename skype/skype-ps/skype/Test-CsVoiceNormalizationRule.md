# Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule

## SYNOPSIS
Tests a telephone number against a voice normalization rule and returns the number after the normalization rule has been applied.
Voice normalization rules are used to convert a telephone dialing requirement (for example, you must dial 9 to access an outside line) to the E.164 phone number format used by Skype for Business Server.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber <PhoneNumber> -NormalizationRule <NormalizationRule> [-AsJob]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet allows you to see the results of applying a voice normalization rule to a given telephone number.
Voice normalization rules are a required part of phone authorization and call routing.
They define the requirements for converting--or translating-- numbers from a format typically entered by users to a standard (E.164) format.
Use this cmdlet to troubleshoot dialing issues or to verify that rules will work as expected against given numbers.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity "global/11 digit number rule" | Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber 14255559999
```

This example runs a voice normalization test against the voice normalization rule with the Identity "global/11 digit number rule".
First the `Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet is run to retrieve the rule with the Identity "global/11 digit number rule".
That rule object is then piped to the `Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet, where the rule is tested against the telephone number 14255559999.
The output will be the DialedNumber after the voice normalization rule "global/11 digit number rule" has been applied.
If this rule does not apply to the DialedNumber value (for example, if the normalization rule matches the pattern for an 11-digit number and you supply a 7-digit number) no value will be returned.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
$a = Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity "global/11 digit number rule"

Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber 5551212 -NormalizationRule $a
```

Example 2 is identical to Example 1 except that instead of piping the results of the Get operation directly to the Test cmdlet, the object is first stored in the variable $a and then is passed as the value to the parameter NormalizationRule to be used as the voice normalization rule against which the test will run.


### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule | Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber 2065559999
```

This example runs a voice normalization test against all voice normalization rules defined within the Skype for Business Server deployment.
First the `Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet is run (with no parameters) to retrieve all the voice normalization rules.
The collection of rules that is returned is then piped to the `Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet, where each rule in the collection is tested against the telephone number 2065559999.
The output will be a list of translated numbers, one for each rule tested.
If a rule does not apply to the DialedNumber value (for example, if the normalization rule matches the pattern for an 11-digit number and you supply a 7-digit number) there will be a blank line in the list for that rule.
