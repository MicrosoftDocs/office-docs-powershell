    The New-CsClientPolicyEntry cmdlet creates new instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Policy.Client.PolicyEntryType object.

- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $x = New-CsClientPolicyEntry -Name "OnlineFeedbackURL" -Value "https://www.litwareinc.com/feedback"

    $y = Get-CsClientPolicy -Identity global

    $y.PolicyEntry.Add($x)

    Set-CsClientPolicy -Instance $y
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 1 demonstrate how a new policy entry can be added to the global client policy.
    This example adds a new feedback option to Skype for Business.
    Note that this example is for demonstration purposes.
    You should not expect to be able to run these commands and add a similar feedback option to your copy of Skype for Business.

    In order to add the new policy entry, the first command in the example uses the New-CsClientPolicyEntry cmdlet to create an entry with the Name OnlineFeedbackURL and the Value https://www.litwareinc.com/feedback.
    The resulting policy entry object is stored in a variable named $x.

    In the second command, the Get-CsClientPolicy cmdlet is used to create an object reference ($y) to the global client policy.
    After the object reference has been created, the Add method is used to add the new policy entry to the PolicyEntry property.
    If PolicyEntry already has one or more entries, the new value will simply be appended to the end of that collection.

    Finally, the last command in the example uses the Set-CsClientPolicy cmdlet to write the changes to the actual global policy.
    If you do not call the Set-CsClientPolicy cmdlet, your changes will exist only in memory, and will disappear as soon as you end your Windows PowerShell session or delete the variable $x.

  code: |-
    $x = New-CsClientPolicyEntry -Name "OnlineFeedbackURL" -Value "https://www.litwareinc.com/feedback"

    Set-CsClientPolicy -Identity global -PolicyEntry $x
  description: |-
    Example 2 is a variation of the commands shown in Example 1.
    In this case, however, the new policy entry replaces all the items currently in the global policy's PolicyEntry property.
    To do that, the first command in the example creates a new policy entry that is stored in a variable named $x.
    The second command then uses the Set-CsClientPolicy cmdlet to set the value of the PolicyEntry property to $x.
    After the command finishes running the only item in the PolicyEntry property will be the new entry.
    Any items contained in that property before the Set-CsClientPolicy cmdlet was called will have replaced by the new entry.

- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $y = Get-CsClientPolicy -Identity global

    $y.PolicyEntry.RemoveAt(0)

    Set-CsClientPolicy -Instance $y
  description: |-
    Example 3 demonstrates how you can remove a client policy entry from the global policy.
    To do this, the first command in the example retrieves the global client policy and stores that information in a variable named $y.

    After the global policy has been retrieved, the second command in the example uses the RemoveAt() method to delete the first policy entry in that policy.
    The policy entry to be removed is indicated by its index number: the first policy entry has an index number of 0, the second policy entry has an index number of 1, and so on.
    The syntax RemoveAt(0) means that the first policy entry will be removed.

    As soon as the policy entry has been removed from the in-memory instance of the global policy, the Set-CsClientPolicy cmdlet is then called in order to write these changes to the actual instance of the global client policy.

- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsClientPolicy -Identity global -PolicyEntry $Null
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 4 removes all the client policy entries configured for the global policy.
    This is done by using the PolicyEntry parameter and setting the parameter value to null ($Null).

  Client policies are the primary mechanism used by Skype for Business Server to manage client software such as Skype for Business.
  When you create or configure a client policy, you have numerous options available to you; for example, you can specify whether or not photos should be used in Skype for Business, whether or not emoticons are allowed in instant messages, and whether or not Skype for Business automatically saves transcripts of instant messaging sessions.
  These options cover many of the client-related settings that administrators need to manage.

  However, they might not cover all the client settings that administrators need to manage.
  In order to add management flexibility and extensibility, client policies include a property named PolicyEntry.
  This multi-valued property enables administrators to add new management options that are not explicitly called out in client policies.
  For example, prior to the release of Lync Server, beta testers were given the ability to add a feedback option to Skype for Business.
  This option was added as a new policy entry, and was created using the New-CsClientPolicyEntry cmdlet.

  Note that you cannot arbitrarily create new policy entries and expect those entries to manage Skype for Business or some other client applications.
  Instead, you will need to wait for notification from Microsoft regarding names and values that can be used to construct new client policy entries.
