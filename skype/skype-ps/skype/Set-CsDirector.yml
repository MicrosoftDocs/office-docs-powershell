    The command shown in Example 1 changes the Archiving Server associated with the Director Director:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    In this example, the Archiving Server is switched to ArchivingServer:dublin-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

  code: |-
    Get-CsService -Director | ForEach-Object {Set-CsDirector -Identity $_.Identity -SipPort 5072}
  description: |-
    Example 2 changes the SIP port for all the Directors currently in use in the organization.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsService` cmdlet and the Director parameter to return a collection of all the Directors in the organization.
    That collection is then piped to the `ForEach-Object`.
    In turn, the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet runs the `Set-CsDirector` cmdlet against each site in the collection, changing the value of the SipPort property to 5072.

uid: SkypeForBusiness.Set-CsDirector
name: Set-CsDirector
description: |-
  The Director authenticates users and responds to user requests without actually hosting user accounts.
  Directors are typically used for organizations that allow external access to the network through Edge Servers.
  In that scenario, Directors not only help alleviate the strain on Front End Servers (by handling authentication requests), but also help shield the internal network from denial-of-service attacks and other malicious traffic.
  Directors are also useful any time multiple Front End Servers are deployed in a central site.
  In that case, Directors receive all user requests and then channel those requests to the appropriate server pool.
  This, again, helps to ease the burden placed on the Front End Servers.

  The `Set-CsDirector` cmdlet enables you to modify the property values for any of the Directors currently in use in your organization.
  This includes changing such things as the Archiving Server or Edge Server associated with the Director, or changing the port used for sending and receiving SIP traffic.
