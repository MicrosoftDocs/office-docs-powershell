    Get-CSConferenceDisclaimer
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 returns information about the conference disclaimer configured for use in your organization.
    Because you are limited to a single disclaimer (configured at the global scope), you do not need to specify an Identity when running this command.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Enables you to use wildcard values when referencing a conference disclaimer.
    Because you can only have a single, global instance of the conference disclaimer, there is really no reason to ever use the Filter parameter.
    However, you can use the following syntax to reference the global disclaimer: -Filter "g*".
    That syntax brings back all the conference disclaimers that have an Identity that begins with the letter "g".

    Unique Identity of the conference disclaimer.
    Because you can only have a single, global instance of the conference disclaimer, you do not need to specify an Identity when calling the Get-CsConferenceDisclaimer cmdlet.
    You can, however, use the following syntax to reference the global disclaimer: -Identity global.

description: |-
  When configuring conferencing settings, administrators can include a legal disclaimer to display to participants at the time participants join conferences hosted by Skype for Business Server.
  This disclaimer is typically used to explain legal and intellectual property laws regarding the conference, and users cannot join the conference without agreeing to the stipulations set forth in the disclaimer.
  Note that this disclaimer is only shown to users who join a conference by using a hyperlink.

  The Get-CsConferenceDisclaimer cmdlet enables you to view the body and header of your organization's disclaimer.
