  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-CsOnlinePSTNGateway -FQDN sbc.contoso.com -SIPSignalingPort 5061
  description: |-
    This example creates an SBC with FQDN sbc.contoso.com and signaling port 5061. All others parameters will stay default. Note the SBC will be in the disabled state.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-CsOnlinePSTNGateway -FQDN sbc.contoso.com -SIPSignalingPort 5061 -ForwardPAI $true -Enabled $true
  description: |-
    This example creates an SBC with FQDN sbc.contoso.com and signaling port 5061. For each outbound to SBC session, the Direct Routing interface will report in P-Asserted-Identity fields the TEL URI and SIP address of the user who made a call. This is useful when a tenant administrator sets the identity of the caller as "Anonymous" or a general number of the company, but for billing purposes the real identity of the user is required.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BypassMode
  description: |+
    Possible values are "None", "Always" and "OnlyForLocalUsers". By setting "Always" mode you indicate that your network is fully routable. If a user usually in site "Seattle", travels to site "Tallinn" and tries to use SBC located in Seattle we will try to deliver the traffic to Seattle assuming that there is connection between Tallinn and Seattle offices. With "OnlyForLocaUsers" you indicate that there is no direct connection between sites. In example above, the traffic will not be send directly from Tallinn to Seattle.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    Used to enable this SBC for outbound calls. Can be used to temporarily remove the SBC from service while it is being updated or during maintenance. Note if the parameter is not set the SBC will be created as disabled (default value -Enabled $false).

  defaultValue: $false
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Microsoft Teams
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FailoverResponseCodes
  description: |+
    If Direct Routing receives any 4xx or 6xx SIP error code in response to an outgoing Invite the call is considered completed by default. (Outgoing in this context is a call
    from a Teams client to the PSTN with traffic flow: Teams Client -> Direct Routing -> SBC -> Telephony network). Setting the SIP codes in this parameter forces Direct Routing
    on receiving the specified codes try another SBC (if another SBC exists in the voice routing policy of the user). Find more information in the "Reference" section of "Phone
    System Direct Routing" documentation.

    Setting this parameter overwrites the default values, so if you want to include the default values, please add them to string.

  defaultValue: 408, 503, 504
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FailoverTimeSeconds
  description: |+
    When set to 10 (default value), outbound calls that are not answered by the gateway within 10 seconds are routed to the next available trunk; if there are no additional trunks, then the call is automatically dropped. In an organization with slow networks and slow gateway responses, that could potentially result in calls being dropped unnecessarily. The default value is 10.

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForwardCallHistory
  description: |+
    Indicates whether call history information will be forwarded to the SBC. If enabled, the Office 365 PSTN Proxy sends two headers: History-info and Referred-By. The default value is False ($False).

  defaultValue: $false

  name: ForwardPai
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the P-Asserted-Identity (PAI) header will be forwarded along with the call. The PAI header provides a way to verify the identity of the caller. The default value is False ($False). Setting this parameter to $true will render the from header anonymous, in accordance of RFC5379 and RFC3325.

  description: |+
    Allows an LBR enabled user working from a network site outside the corporate network or a network site on the corporate network not configured using a tenant network site to make outbound PSTN calls or receive inbound PSTN calls via an LBR enabled gateway. The default value is False.

  name: GatewaySiteLbrEnabled
  description: |+
    Used to enable this SBC to report assigned site location. Site location is used for Location Based Routing. When this parameter is enabled ($True), the SBC will report the site
    name as defined by the tenant administrator. On an incoming call to a Teams user the value of the site assigned to the SBC is compared with the value of the site assigned to
    the user to make a routing decision. The parameter is mandatory for enabling Location Based Routing feature. The default value is False ($False).

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    When creating a new SBC, the identity must be identical to the -FQDN parameter, described above. If the parameter is not defined the Identity will be copied from the -FQDN parameter. The Identity parameter is not mandatory.

  name: MaxConcurrentSessions
  description: |+
    Used by the alerting system. When any value is set, the alerting system will generate an alert to the tenant administrator when the number of concurrent sessions is 90% or higher than this value. If the parameter is not set, alerts are not generated. However, the monitoring system will report the number of concurrent sessions every 24 hours.

  name: MediaRelayRoutingLocationOverride
  description: |+
    Allows selecting path for media manually. Direct Routing assigns a datacenter for media path based on the public IP of the SBC. We always select closest to the SBC datacenter. However, in some cases a public IP from for example a US range can be assigned to an SBC located in Europe. In this case we will be using not optimal media path. We only recommend setting this parameter if the call logs clearly indicate that automatic assignment of the datacenter for media path does not assign the closest to the SBC datacenter.

  Use this cmdlet to create a new Session Border Controller (SBC) configuration. Each configuration contains specific settings for an SBC. These settings configure such entities as the SIP signaling port, whether media bypass is enabled on this SBC, will the SBC send SIP Options, and specify the limit of maximum concurrent sessions. The cmdlet also lets the administrator drain the SBC by setting parameter -Enabled to $true or $false state. When the Enabled parameter is set to $false, the SBC will continue existing calls, but all new calls will be routed to another SBC in a route (if one exists).
