 [-DisplayNumber <String>] [-EnabledForFederation <Boolean>] [-EnterpriseVoiceEnabled <Boolean>]
 [-PrimaryLanguage <String>]

## DESCRIPTION
The Audio Test service enables Skype for Business Server users to test their voice connections before they make a voice call.
To do this, users click the Check call quality button found on the Audio Device tab of the Skype for Business Options dialog box.
When a user clicks this button, a call will be made to the automated Audio Test service.
The call will be answered and, after an introductory prompt is played, the caller will be asked to record a brief message (10 seconds maximum).
That recording will then be replayed, enabling the caller to hear what he or she sounds like over the current connection.

The Audio Test service relies, in part, on Active Directory contact objects.
These objects are automatically created for you when you install Audio Bot; there is no way to manually create these objects.
However, administrators can use the `Get-CsAudioTestServiceApplication` cmdlet to retrieve information about the various test service contacts currently in use in the organization.
Administrators can also use the `Set-CsAudioTestServiceApplication` cmdlet to modify the properties of these contacts.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Set-CsAudioTestServiceApplication -Identity "sip:RedmondAudioTest@litwareinc.com" -PrimaryLanguage "en-US"
```

In Example 1, the primary language for the Audio Test service contact sip:RedmondAudioTest@litwareinc.com is set to U.S.
English (en-US).


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Set-CsAudioTestServiceApplication -Identity "sip:RedmondAudioTest@litwareinc.com" -PrimaryLanguage $Null
```

Example 2 clears the value of the PrimaryLanguage property for the Audio Test service contact sip:RedmondAudioTest@litwareinc.com.
This is done by including the PrimaryLanguage parameter and setting the parameter value to $Null.


### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------
```
Get-CsAudioTestServiceApplication | Set-CsAudioTestServiceApplication -PrimaryLanguage "en-US"
```

In Example 3, all the Audio Test service contacts in use in the organization are configured to use U.S.
English as their primary language.
To do this, the `Get-CsAudioTestServiceApplication` cmdlet is first called without any parameters in order to return a collection of the Audio Test service contacts.
This collection is then piped to the `Set-CsAudioTestServiceApplication`, which assigns U.S.
English (en-Us) to the PrimaryLanguage property for each contact in the collection.
