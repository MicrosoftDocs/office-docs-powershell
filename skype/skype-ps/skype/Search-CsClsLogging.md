# Search-CsClsLogging

## SYNOPSIS
Provides a command-line option for searching the centralized logging service log files.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.


## SYNTAX

```
Search-CsClsLogging [-AsXml] [-CallId <String>] [-Components <String[]>] [-Computers <String[]>]
 [-ConferenceId <String>] [-CorrelationIds <String[]>] [-EndTime <DateTime>] [-IP <IPAddress>]
 [-LogLevel <String>] [-MatchAll] [-MatchAny] [-OutputFilePath <String>] [-Phone <String>] [-Pools <String[]>]
 [-SipContents <String>] [-SkipNetworkLogs] [-StartTime <DateTime>] [-Uri <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The centralized logging service (which replaces the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides a way for administrators to manage logging and tracing for all computers and pools running Skype for Business Server.
Centralized logging enables administrators to stop, start and configure logging for one or more pools and computers by using a single command; for example, you can use one command to enable Address Book service logging on all your Address Book servers.
This differs from the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools, which had to be individually managed (including individually stopped and started) on each server.
In addition, the centralized logging service also provides a way for administrators to search trace logs from the command, using the Windows PowerShell command-line interface and the `Search-CsClsLogging` cmdlet.

Centralized logging is built around a series of predefined scenarios that offer a more finely-targeted approach to logging than offered in previous versions of Skype for Business Server.
These scenarios predetermine the server components and logging for you; as a result, an administrator enabling the RGS scenario can be confident that he or she will only log information relevant to the Response Group service and not to, say, the audio conferencing provider service.

The `Search-CsClsLogging` cmdlet provides a command line option for searching the log files generated by the centralized logging service.

Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Search-CsClsLogging` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Search-CsClsLogging -Computers "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -IP "192.168.0.242"
```

The command shown in Example 1 searches for the IP address 192.168.0.242 in the log files found on the computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Search-CsClsLogging -Computers "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -IP "192.168.0.242" -Uri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -MatchAll
```

In Example 2, a search is made for entries that match both the IP address 192.168.0.242 and the Uri sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com.
The MatchAll parameter specifies that all the criteria must be met for an entry to be recorded as a match.


### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Search-CsClsLogging -Computers "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -IP "192.168.0.242" -Uri "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -MatchAny
```

The command shown in Example 3 searches for entries that match either the IP address 192.168.0.242 or the Uri sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com.
The MatchAny parameter specifies that just one of the criteria must be met for an entry to be recorded as a match.
