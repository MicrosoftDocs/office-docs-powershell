examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsCloudCallDataConnectorConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EnableCallDataConnector $False
  description: |-
    Example 1 disables the Call Data Connector for site:Redmond.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Get-CsCloudCallDataConnectorConfiguration | Set-CsCloudCallDataConnectorConfiguration -EnableCallDataConnector $True
  description: |-
    Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1.
    In this case, the EnableCallDataConnector property is modified for each collection of Cloud Call Data Connector configuration settings currently in use in the organization.
    To do this, the command first calls the \`Get-CsCloudCallDataConnectorConfiguration\` cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the Cloud Call Data Connector settings currently in use.
    This collection is then piped to the \`Set-CsCloudCallDataConnectorConfiguration\` cmdlet, which takes each item in the collection and changes the value of the EnableCallDataConnector property to $True.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    Get-CsCloudCallDataConnectorConfiguration -Filter "site:*"| Set-CsCloudCallDataConnectorConfiguration -EnableCallDataConnector $True
  description: |-
    Another variation of the command used in Example 1 is shown in Example 3.

    In this example, the PurgeHourOfDay property is changed for all the Cloud Call Data Connector settings that have been configured at the site scope.

    To perform this task, the command first calls the `Get-CsCloudCallDataConnectorConfiguration` cmdlet along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "site:*" ensures that only Cloud Call Data Connector settings that have an Identity that begins with the string value "site:" will be returned.

    The filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsCloudCallDataConnectorConfiguration` cmdlet, which changes the EnableCallDataConnector property for each item in that collection.

  Call Data Connector greatly simplifies call monitoring in a hybrid environment because you no longer need to use different sets of on-premises and online tools to monitor all of your users' call quality. Whether your users are homed on premises or online, you can choose to view call quality for your entire organization online.

  With Call Data Connector, the Skype for Business Server pushes call data to the cloud service so that you can leverage the Skype for Business Online Call Analytics (CA) and Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) tools.
