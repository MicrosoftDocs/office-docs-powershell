    Remove-CsOAuthServer -Identity "Office365"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 deletes a single OAuth server: the server with the identity "Office 365".

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsOAuthServer | Remove-CsOAuthServer
  description: |-
    Example 2 deletes all the OAuth servers configured for use in the organization.
    To carry out this task, the command first calls the `Get-CsOAuthServer` cmdlet without any parameters in order to return all the OAuth servers.
    These servers are then piped to, and removed by, the `Remove-CsOAuthServer` cmdlet.

description: |-
  In Skype for Business Server, server-to-server authentication (for example, the authentication that enables Skype for Business Server and Exchange to share information) is carried out using the OAuth security protocol.
  This type of authentication typically requires three servers: the two servers that need to communicate with one another (Server A and B) and a third-party security token server.
  If Servers A and B need to communicate with one another, the two servers contact the token server (also known as an OAuth server) and obtain mutually-trusted security tokens that the two servers can exchange in order to prove their identities.

  If you are using an on-premises version of Skype for Business Server and you need to communicate with another server product that fully supports the OAuth protocol then you typically do not need to use a token server; that's because these server products are able to issue their own security tokens.
  However, if you need to communicate with another server product (including server products found on Office 365) then you will need to use a token servers.
  These token servers can be managed by using the CsOAuthServer cmdlets.
