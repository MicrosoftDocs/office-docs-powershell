# Get-CsWindowsService

## SYNOPSIS
Get-CsWindowsService returns detailed information about Skype for Business Server components that run as Windows services.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Get-CsWindowsService [[-Name] <String>] [-ComputerName <String>] [-ExcludeActivityLevel] [-Report <String>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Many Skype for Business Server components run as standard Windows services; for example, the Skype for Business Server Conferencing Attendant application is actually a service named RTCCAA.
The Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet enables you to retrieve detailed information about these Skype for Business Server services and only these services.
That's because the cmdlet has been designed to ignore any service that is not part of Skype for Business Server.

The fact that the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet automatically filters out non-Skype for Business Server services is one advantage the cmdlet offers over the generic Get-Service cmdlet that ships as part of Windows PowerShell.
In addition to that, there is another reason to use the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet if you need to retrieve information for a Skype for Business Server service: the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet returns useful data that the Get-Service cmdlet does not return.
For example, when returning information about the Skype for Business Server Conferencing Attendant service, the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet reports back the number of concurrent calls being handled by the service (the service activity level).
The Get-Service cmdlet does not.

By default the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet runs against the local computer.
However, by including the ComputerName parameter you can return information about the Skype for Business Server services running on a remote computer.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Get-CsWindowsService
```

The command shown in Example 1 returns information about all the Skype for Business Server services installed on the local computer.
This is done by calling the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet without any parameters.



### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Get-CsWindowsService | Format-List
```

Example 2 also returns information about the Skype for Business Server services on the local computer; in this case, however, the data is displayed in list format.
(Among other things, this enables you to view all the property values for each service.
In the default, tabular view, only a subset of property values is displayed.) To carry out this task, the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet is first called, then the resulting information is piped to the Format-List cmdlet.



### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------
```
Get-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCSrv"
```

Example 3 returns information for a single Skype for Business Server service: the service with the name RTCSrv.



### -------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------
```
Get-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCSrv" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty RoleName

```

In Example 4, detailed information is displayed for all the service roles handled by the RTCSrv service.
To perform this task, the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet is first used to return information about the RTCSrv service.
This information is then piped to the Select-Object cmdlet, which uses the ExpandProperty parameter to display all the roles handled by the RTCSrv service.
Note that this command will return an error message if a service does not have a role name.


### -------------------------- Example 5 ------------------------
```
Get-CsWindowsService -Computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
```

The command shown in Example 5 returns information about the Skype for Business Server services installed on the remote computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This is done by including the ComputerName parameter followed by the FQDN of the remote computer.



### -------------------------- Example 6 ------------------------
```
Get-CsWindowsService -Report C:\Logs\Services.html
```

Example 6 returns information about all the Skype for Business Server services installed on the local computer.
In addition, the Report parameter is included in order to save error information to a file named C:\Logs\Services.html.
If the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet encounters any problems in retrieving service data, information about that problem will be recorded in Services.html.



### -------------------------- Example 7 ------------------------
```
Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running"}
```

In Example 7, information is returned only for the Skype for Business Server services on the local computer that are currently running.
To accomplish this, the command first calls the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet to return a collection of all the Skype for Business Server services, running or not running.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those services where the Status property is equal to Running.



### -------------------------- Example 8 ------------------------
```
Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*Application Sharing*"}
```

Example 8 shows how you can retrieve information for a particular service even if you do not know the actual name of that service (in this case, RTCASMCU).
To perform this task, the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet is first called without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the Skype for Business Server services on the local computer.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects the one service where the DisplayName property includes (-like) the string value "Application Sharing".
The end result: information is displayed for the Skype for Business Server Application Sharing Conferencing service.


### -------------------------- Example 9 ------------------------
```
Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.RoleName -contains "ApplicationServer"}
```

Example 9 returns information about any services that host the Application Server role.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet to return a collection of all the Skype for Business Server services on the local computer.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects those services where the RoleName property includes (-contains) ApplicationServer.


## PARAMETERS

### -Name

Name of the service you want to return information for.
Note that you must use the service name (for example, RTCCAA) and not the service display name.
You can only pass a single service name to the Name parameter; in addition you cannot use wildcards in the service name.

Note, too that the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet can only return information for Skype for Business Server services; you cannot use this cmdlet to return information for other Windows services.
For those services, you might be able to use the Windows PowerShell Get-Service cmdlet.

If you do not include this parameter, the Get-CsWindowsService cmdlet will return information about all your Skype for Business Server services.
