description: |-
  Skype for Business Server uses certificates as a way for servers and server roles to verify their identities; for example, an Edge Server uses certificates to verify that the computer it is communicating with really is a Front End Server and vice versa.
  In order to fully implement Skype for Business Server you will need to have the appropriate certificates assigned to the appropriate server roles.

  In order for certificates to be assigned to a Skype for Business Server role those certificates must be made known to Skype for Business Server.
  The Request-CsCertificate cmdlet enables you to make both online and offline requests for new certificates.
  If an online request is made, the certificate will automatically be downloaded and saved in the local certificate store; equally important, it will be immediately available for use by Skype for Business Server.
  If an offline request is made, a certificate file will be sent to you.
  At that point, you can use the Import-CsCertificate cmdlet to import the certificate, a process that makes the certificate available for assignment to a Skype for Business Server server role.
