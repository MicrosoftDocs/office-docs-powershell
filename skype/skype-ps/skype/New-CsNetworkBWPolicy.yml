### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a bandwidth policy in memory that can be applied to the bandwidth policy profile.
  In Skype for Business Server, the policy applies to either audio or video bandwidth.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.
module: SkypeForBusiness

  code: |-
    $bwp = New-CsNetworkBWPolicy -BWLimit 200 -BWSessionLimit 3000 -BWPolicyModality video
  description: |-
    This example creates a new bandwidth policy and assigns it to the variable $bwp.
    All parameters for the New-CsNetworkBWPolicy cmdlet are required.
    In this example we specified a total bandwidth limit (BWLimit) of 2000 kbps and a bandwidth session limit (BWSessionLimit) of 300 kbps, and we applied these limits to video sessions (-BWPolicyModality video).

  code: |-
    $bwp = New-CsNetworkBWPolicy -BWLimit 200 -BWSessionLimit 3000 -BWPolicyModality video

    New-CsNetworkBandwidthPolicyProfile -Identity LowBWLimit -BWPolicy $bwp
  description: |-
    Example 2 expands on Example 1 by assigning the new bandwidth policy to a policy profile.
    The command in line 1 is identical to Example 1: it creates video bandwidth limitations.
    Line 2 then calls the New-CsNetworkBandwidthPolicyProfile cmdlet to add that policy to a new profile.
    The new profile receives an Identity of LowBWLimit.
    Then we use the BWPolicy parameter, giving it the value $bwp, which is the variable containing the new bandwidth policy we just created in Line 1.

description: |-
  This cmdlet creates a new bandwidth policy.
  A bandwidth policy is used to define bandwidth limitations for certain modalities.
  (In Skype for Business Server, only audio and video modalities can be assigned bandwidth limitations.) The bandwidth policy is created only in memory, so the output must be assigned to a variable and then passed as a value to the BWPolicy parameter of the New-CsNetworkBandwidthPolicyProfile cmdlet or the Set-CsNetworkBandwidthPolicyProfile cmdlet.
  Bandwidth policies are applied to policy profiles, which can store multiple policies for a single profile and are part of the global network configuration for call admission control (CAC).

  Note that the recommended method of assigning audio and video policies is to assign them directly to a bandwidth policy profile by calling the New-CsNetworkBandwidthPolicyProfile or the Set-CsNetworkBandwidthPolicyProfile cmdlet and specifying values for the AudioBWLimit, AudioBWSessionLimit, VideoBWLimit, and VideoBWSessionLimit parameters.
