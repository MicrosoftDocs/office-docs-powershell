# Remove-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Removes settings that provide public switched telephone network (PSTN) phone numbers to access Exchange Subscriber Access and Auto Attendant features.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet allows you to remove settings that determine where Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access calls are rerouted to over PSTN when IP connectivity is lost.

Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access are features of Exchange.
The Auto Attendant feature provides voice recognition and touch-tone control (dual-tone multifrequency, or DTMF) for outside callers to navigate a company's phone system to reach the desired department or employee or, in Message Taking Mode, to accept messages for users.
(Voice rerouting for Message Taking Mode is recommended.) Subscriber Access allows internal users to access their Microsoft Outlook mailbox from a phone.
The numbers provided by these settings allow callers to leave voice mail messages for Enterprise Voice users (the AutoAttendantNumber setting) and for those users to retrieve voice mail even if the IP connectivity from the Skype for Business Server deployment at a remote site to Exchange in the data center is unavailable (the SubscriberAccessNumber setting).

Note that if you call this cmdlet to remove the Global settings, those settings will simply be reset to their defaults.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Remove-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1
```

This example removes the voice mail rerouting configuration settings for the site Redmond1.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration | Remove-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration
```

This example removes all the voice mail rerouting settings for this deployment of Skype for Business Server.
The command first retrieves all the voice mail rerouting configuration settings by calling the `Get-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration` cmdlet.
The settings retrieved by this call are then passed to the `Remove-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration` cmdlet to delete each one.
