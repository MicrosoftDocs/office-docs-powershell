# Get-CsVideoTrunk

## SYNOPSIS
Use the Get-CsVideoTrunk to list properties about the video trunks in your organization.
Video trunks are Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunks between the Video Interop Server and a Video Gateway that are used to setup video calls between 3rd party video teleconferencing systems (VTCs) connected to the Video Gateway and Skype conferences or Skype endpoints.

## SYNTAX

### Filter
```
Get-CsVideoTrunk [-Filter <String>] [-PoolFqdn <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Identity
```
Get-CsVideoTrunk [[-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity>] [-PoolFqdn <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Video trunks are SIP trunks between the Video Interop Server and a Video Gateway that are used to setup video calls between 3rd party video teleconferencing systems (VTCs) connected to the Video Gateway and Skype conferences or Skype endpoints.

Trunk information is read-only.
You cannot create, delete or modify trunks by using Windows PowerShell.
Those operations can only be carried out by using Skype for Business Server Topology Builder.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles that can run this cmdlet (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt.

`Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -Match "Get-CsVideoTrunk"}`

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- 
```
Get-CsVideoTrunk
```

This example returns information about all the video trunks configured for use in the organization.

### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- 
```
Get-CsVideoTrunk -Identity "VideoTrunk:192.168.0.240"
```

This example returns information for a single video trunk with the identity "VideoTrunk:192.168.0.240".

### -------------------------- Example 3 -------------------------- 
```
Get-CsVideoTrunk -Filter "VideoTrunk:192.168*"
```

This example uses the Filter parameter to return all the video trunks located on the IP subnet 192.168.
The filter value "VideoTrunk:192.168*" limits the returned data to video trunks that having an Identity that begins with the string value "192.168".
