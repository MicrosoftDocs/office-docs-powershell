# New-CsPersistentChatComplianceConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS

Creates a new collection of Persistent Chat compliance configuration settings at the site or the service scope.
Persistent Chat compliance enables administrators to maintain an archive of Persistent Chat items and activities including: new messages; new events (for example, a user entering or existing a chat room); file uploads and downloads; and searches run against the chat history.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.

## DESCRIPTION

The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

Many organizations (including organizations involved in health care and organizations involved in the financial industry) are required to maintain archives of all their electronic communications; this includes conversations that might take place using the Persistent Chat service.
Skype for Business Server allows you to create a separate compliance database that keeps a detailed of archive of everything that happens in your Persistent Chat chat rooms.
Persistent Chat compliance can be enabled or disabled at the site scope or at the service scope (that is, compliance can be enabled or disabled for a given Persistent Chat pool).
In addition, Persistent Chat compliance can only be managed using the Windows PowerShell command-line interface; there are no options available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel for managing Persistent Chat compliance.

Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the New-CsPersistentChatComplianceConfiguration cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- 
```
New-CsPersistentChatComplianceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" -AddUserDetails $True -AddChatRoomDetails $True

```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of Persistent Chat compliance configuration settings for the Redmond site.
In this example, both the AddUserDetails and the AddChatRoomDetails properties are set to True ($True).


### -------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- 
```
New-CsPersistentChatComplianceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" -RunInterval "00:30:00"

```

Example 2 also demonstrates how to create a new collection of Persistent Chat compliance configuration settings for the Redmond site.
In this example, the RunInterval property is set to 30 minutes; that is, 00 hours : 30 minutes : 00 seconds.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the new Persistent Chat compliance settings being created.
New compliance settings can be created at either the site or the service scope (for the Persistent Chat Server service, only).
To create new settings at the site scope, use syntax similar to this:

`-Identity "site:Redmond"`

To create new settings at the service scope, use syntax like this:

`-Identity "service:PersistentChatServer:atl-gc-001.litwareinc.com"`

```yaml
Type: XdsIdentity

Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AdapterOutputDirectory
Full path to the folder where adapter data is stored.
You must have a separate folder for each adapter.

```yaml
Type: String

```

### -AdapterType

Specifies the fully qualified name of a .Net managed type that implements the Microsoft.Rtc.Internal.Chat.Server.Compliance.IComplianceAdapter interface.
This adapter is supplied by a third-party or can be set to the internal XML adapter, "Microsoft.Rtc.Internal.Chat.Server.Compliance.XmlAdapter,compliance".

If you do not specify an adapter type Persistent Chat will not save compliance data.

Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AddUserDetails

When set to True, additional details about each chat room user are provided to the adapter.
This has the potential to greatly increase the size of the compliance data.

The default value is False.



```yaml
Type: Boolean

These files will have the file extension .ATTACH and are placed in the location specified by the AdapterOutputDirectory.



```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019
