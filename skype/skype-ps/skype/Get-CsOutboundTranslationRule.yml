  Call this cmdlet to retrieve an existing outbound translation rule.
  Skype for Business Server normalizes phone numbers to E.164 format.
  However, many private branch exchange (PBX) systems aren't able to work with this format.
  Outbound translations rules translate the number to the local dialing format prior to sending the number to the Mediation Server or gateway.

  Each outbound translation rule is associated with a trunk configuration.
  More than one outbound translation rule can be associated with each trunk configuration.
  Therefore, the Identity for each rule consists of a scope along with a name that is unique within the scope (in the format scope/name, for example site:Redmond/OBR1).
  The rule is automatically associated with the trunk configuration with the same scope.
