User-level policy for tenant admin to configure meeting broadcast behavior for the broadcast event organizer.  Use this cmdlet to update an existing policy.


## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
PS C:\> Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity Global -AllowBroadcastScheduling $false 
```

Sets the value of the Default (Global) Broadcast Policy in the organization to disable broadcast scheduling, and leaves all other parameters the same.

## PARAMETERS

### -AllowBroadcastScheduling
Specifies whether this user can create broadcast events in Teams.  This settng impacts broadcasts that use both self-service and external encoder production methods. 

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllowBroadcastTranscription
Specifies whether real-time transcription and translation can be enabled in the broadcast event.  Note: this setting is applicable to broadcast events that use Teams Meeting production only and does not apply when external encoder is used as production method.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BroadcastAttendeeVisibilityMode
Specifies the attendee visibility mode of the broadcast events created by this user.  This setting controls who can watch the broadcast event - e.g. anyone can watch this event including anonymous users or only authenticated users in my company can watch the event.  Note: this setting is applicable to broadcast events that use Teams Meeting production only and does not apply when external encoder is used as production method.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BroadcastRecordingMode
Specifies whether broadcast events created by this user are always recorded, never recorded or user can choose whether to record or not.  Note: this setting is applicable to broadcast events that use Teams Meeting production only and does not apply when external encoder is used as production method.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Description
Enables administrators to provide additional text about the conferencing policy. For example, the Description might indicate the users the policy should be assigned to.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

```yaml

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
