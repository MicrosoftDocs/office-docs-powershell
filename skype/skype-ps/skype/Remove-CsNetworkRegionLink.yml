  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkRegionLink | Where-Object {$_.BWPolicyProfileID -eq "HighBWLimits"} | Remove-CsNetworkRegionLink
  description: |-
    Example 2 removes all network region links that are using the bandwidth policy profile named HighBWLimits.
    The first cmdlet called in the example is the `Get-CsNetworkRegionLink` cmdlet (with no parameters), which will retrieve all region links.
    This collection of links is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet.
    The `Where-Object` cmdlet looks through each member of the collection one-by-one, checking the value of the BWPolicyProfileID property.
    If this property is equal to (-eq) HighBWLimits, we pipe that member to the `Remove-CsNetworkRegionLink` cmdlet, which removes the link.
