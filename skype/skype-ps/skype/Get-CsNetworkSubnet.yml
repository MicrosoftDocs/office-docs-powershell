examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkSubnet
  description: |-
    This example retrieves all subnets within the Skype for Business Server deployment.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkSubnet -Identity 172.11.15.0
  description: |-
    This example retrieves all information about the subnet with the Identity (the Subnet ID) 172.11.15.0.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkSubnet -Filter 172.11.*
  description: |-
    This example retrieves all subnets with identities that begin with 172.11.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkSubnet | Where-Object {$_.NetworkSiteID -eq "Vancouver"}
  description: |-
    Example 4 retrieves all subnets associated with the Vancouver site.
    We first call the Get-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet with no parameters, which, as we saw in Example 2, retrieves all defined subnets.
    We then pipe this collection of subnets to the Where-Object cmdlet.
    The Where-Object cmdlet takes that collection and narrows it down to only those subnets with a NetworkSiteID equal to (-eq) Vancouver.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Use this parameter to perform a wildcard search of all subnets based on Identity.

    (such as 172.11.10.0, 172.11.25.0, etc.).
