  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Unique identity to be assigned to the policy.
    New policies can be created at the site or per-user scope.
    To create a new site policy, use the prefix "site:" and the name of the site as the Identity.
    For example, to create a new policy for the Redmond site you would use this syntax: `-Identity site:Redmond`.
    To create a new per-user policy, this syntax: `-Identity SalesDepartmentPolicy`.

    You cannot create a new global policy.
    If you want to make changes to the global policy, use the Set-CsCallViaWorkPolicy cmdlet instead.
    Likewise, you cannot create a new site or per-user policy if a policy with that Identity already exists.
    If you need to make changes to an existing policy, use the Set-CsCallViaWorkPolicy cmdlet.
