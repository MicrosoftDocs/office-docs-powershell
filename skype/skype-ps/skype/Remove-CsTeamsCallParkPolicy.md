# Remove-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

The TeamsCallParkPolicy controls whether or not users are able to leverage the call park feature in Microsoft Teams.  Call park allows enterprise voice customers to place a call on hold and then perform a number of actions on that call: transfer to another department, retrieve via the same phone, or retrieve via a different Teams phone.  The Remove-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy cmdlet lets delete a custom policy that has been configured in your organization.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy [-Tenant <Guid>] [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The TeamsCallParkPolicy controls whether or not users are able to leverage the call park feature in Microsoft Teams.  Call park allows enterprise voice customers to place a call on hold and then perform a number of actions on that call: transfer to another department, retrieve via the same phone, or retrieve via a different phone.  The Remove-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy cmdlet lets delete a custom policy that has been configured in your organization.

If you run Remove-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy on the Global policy, it will be reset to the defaults provided for new organizations.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy -Identity SalesPolicy
```

Deletes a custom policy that has already been created in the organization.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the client policy to be removed.
To "remove" the global policy, use the following syntax: `-Identity global`.
(Note that the global policy cannot actually be removed.  Instead, all the properties in that policy will be reset to their default values.) To remove a per-user policy, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity "SalesDepartmentPolicy"`.
You cannot use wildcards when specifying a policy Identity.
