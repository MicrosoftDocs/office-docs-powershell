  code: |-
    $x = Get-CsPresenceProvider -Identity "global/contoso.com"

    $x.Fqdn = "contoso2.com"

    Set-CsPresenceProvider -Instance $x
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 1 demonstrate how you can use the `Set-CsPresenceProvider` cmdlet to modify the FQDN of an existing presence provider.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-CsPresenceProvider` cmdlet to create an object reference to the presence provider with the Identity "global/contoso.com".
    This object reference is stored in the variable $x.

    In the second command, the FQDN property of the object reference is set to contoso2.com, the new FQDN for the presence provider.
    After the FQDN property has been configured, the `Set-CsPresenceProvider` cmdlet is used, along with the Instance property, to write these changes to the global collection of User Services configuration settings.
