description: |-
  Voice routing policies are used in "hybrid" scenarios: when some of your users are homed on the on-premises version of Skype for Business Server and other users are homed on Skype for Business Online.
  Assigning your Skype for Business Online users a voice routing policy enables those users to receive and to place phones calls to the public switched telephone network by using your on-premises SIP trunks.

  Note that simply assigning a user a voice routing policy will not enable them to make PSTN calls via Skype for Business Online.
  Among other things, you will also need to enable those users for Enterprise Voice and will need to assign them an appropriate voice policy and dial plan.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
