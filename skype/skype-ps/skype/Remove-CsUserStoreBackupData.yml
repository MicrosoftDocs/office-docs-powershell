  Removes outdated information from the specified user store.
  "Outdated information" refers user data from a Registrar pool no longer paired with the specified user store.
  For example, suppose Pools A and B were once paired; now, however, that association has been changed and Pools A and C are paired.

  Skype for Business Server enables you to associate a pair of pools.
  When you do this, each pool maintains two sets of user information: information about the users homed on the pool in question and information about the users homed on the associated pool.
  Maintaining both sets of user information allows Pool B to register and service the users from Pool A should Pool A need to be failed over.

  If you later change the association between these two pools, the "extra" user data is not automatically deleted from the two pools; for example, Pool A will continue to store user data for Pool B.
  (However, this data will no longer be updated and replicated.) The `Remove-CsUserStoreBackupData` cmdlet enables you to delete the data from Pool B that is no longer needed on Pool A.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Remove-CsUserStoreBackupData` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
