    New-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber -PrimaryUri "sip:RedmondDialIn@litwareinc.com" -DisplayNumber "1-800-555-1234" -LineUri "tel:+18005551234" -Pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -PrimaryLanguage "en-US" -Regions "Redmond"
  description: |-
    Example 1 creates a new dial-in conferencing access number with the primary URI sip:RedmondDialIn@litwareinc.com.
    In addition to the PrimaryUri parameter, the command also includes parameters that configure the telephone number as displayed in Skype for Business (DisplayNumber); the telephone number in the E.164 format (LineUri); the Registrar pool the new number is assigned to `(-Pool): the primary language for the number (PrimaryLanguage)`; and the region the new number is assigned to (Regions).

  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1; the only difference is that the command shown in this example also assigns two secondary languages (French Canadian and French) to the new dial-in conferencing access number.
    To assign these secondary languages, the SecondaryLanguages parameter is included, along with a comma-separated list of the languages to be assigned (fr-CA and fr-FR).

description: |-
  Dial-in conferencing enables users to use any kind of telephone (such as standard "land line," a mobile phone, or a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone) to join the audio portion of an online conference.
  This enables users to participate in the meeting even if they do not have a computer or an Internet connection.
  Users have full audio capabilities: they can speak to other participants and hear everything that takes place.
  They just aren't able to see shared slides, video feeds, or other visual elements.

  In order to provide users with dial-in conferencing capabilities, you must create dial-in conferencing access numbers: phone numbers users can call in order to be connected to a meeting.
  Dial-in conferencing access numbers are created by using the New-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber cmdlet.
  When you create a new dial-in conferencing access number, you actually create a new contact object in Active Directory Domain Services; this contact object is used to represent the access number and all its properties.

  When creating a new dial-in number you must include the following parameters: PrimaryUri; LineURI; Pool; DisplayNumber; PrimaryLanguage; and Regions.
  All of these parameters (and their parameter values) are reasonably straightforward, with perhaps one exception: Regions.
  When you create a new access number, that number must be associated with one or more regions.
  In turn, a region cannot be associated with a dial-in conferencing number unless that region appears in at least one dial plan.
  If a region appears in the DialInConferencingRegion property of at least one dial plan, then it can be associated with an access number.
  If not, then the region cannot be associated with an access number.
  That simply means you must first create a dial plan, and specify a region for that dial plan, before you can create a dial-in conferencing access number.
