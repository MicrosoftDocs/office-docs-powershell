### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Tests to see if a user can connect to his or her audio conferencing provider.
  An audio conferencing provider is a third-party company that provides organizations with conferencing services.
  Among other things, audio conferencing providers enable users located off site, and not connected to the corporate network or the Internet, to participate in the audio portion of a conference or meeting.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.
module: SkypeForBusiness

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Test-CsAudioConferencingProvider -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
  description: |-
    Example 1 checks to see if a test user defined for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com is able to connect to his or her audio conferencing provider.
    This command requires that at least one test user be defined for the pool.
    If no test users have been defined for atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com, then the command will fail; that's because the `Test-CsAudioConferencingProvider` cmdlet will not know which user to employ in the test.
    If you have not defined test users for a pool, then you must include the UserSipAddress parameter and the credentials of the user account that the command should employ when verifying the connection with an audio conferencing provider.

  code: |-
    $credential = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

    Test-CsAudioConferencingProvider -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -UserSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -UserCredential $credential
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 test the ability of a specific user (litwareinc\kenmyer) to connect to his audio conferencing provider.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell command-line interface credentials object containing the name and password of the user Ken Myer.
    (Because the logon name litwareinc\kenmyer has been included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box only requires the administrator to enter the password for the Ken Myer account.) The resulting credentials object is stored in a variable named $credential.

    The second command then checks to see if this user can connect to his audio conferencing provider.
    To carry out this task, the `Test-CsAudioConferencingProvider` cmdlet is called, along with three parameters: TargetFqdn (the FQDN of the Registrar pool); UserCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing Ken Myer's user credentials); and UserSipAddress (the SIP address corresponding to the supplied user credentials).

    To store output in a logger variable named $TestOutput use the following syntax:

    `-OutLoggerVariable TestOutput`

    Note: Do not prepend a $ character when specifying the variable name.

    To save the information stored in the logger variable to an HTML file, use a command similar to this:

    `$TestOutput.ToHTML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.html`

description: |-
  An audio conferencing provider is a third-party company that provides organizations with conferencing services.
  Among other things, audio conferencing providers enable users located off site, and not connected to the corporate network or the Internet, to participate in the audio portion of a conference or meeting.
  Audio conferencing providers often provide high-end services such as live translation, transcription, and live per-conference operator assistance.

  The `Test-CsAudioConferencingProvider` cmdlet is used to verify that a user is able to make a connection to his or her audio conferencing provider.
  Note that this cmdlet can be run in one of two ways.
  Many administrators will use the `CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration` cmdlets to set up test users for each of their Registrar pools.
  These test users represent a pair of user accounts that have been preconfigured for use with synthetic transactions.
  (Typically these are test accounts and not accounts that belong to actual users.) If test users are configured for a pool, administrators can run the `Test-CsAudioConferencingProvider` cmdlet against that pool without having to specify the identity of (and supply the credentials for) the user account involved in the test.

  Alternatively, administrators can run the `Test-CsAudioConferencingProvider` cmdlet using an actual user account.
  If you decide to conduct the test using an actual user account you will need to supply the logon name and password for that account.

  Note that the test will fail if the user employed by the `Test-CsAudioConferencingProvider` cmdlet has not been assigned an audio conferencing provider.
