### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Deletes an existing User Services policy.
  User Services policies determine whether or not a user's contacts are stored in Skype for Business Server or in the Unified Contact Store.
  The Unified Contact Store provides a way for users to maintain a single set of contacts that can be accessed using Skype for Business, Microsoft Outlook and/or Microsoft Outlook Web Access.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Remove-CsUserServicesPolicy -Identity "RedmondUserServicesPolicy"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 deletes the per-user User Services policy RedmondUserServicesPolicy.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsUserServicesPolicy -Filter "site:*" | Remove-CsUserServicesPolicy
  description: |-
    Example 2 deletes all the User Services policies configured at the site scope.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsUserServicesPolicy` cmdlet and the Filter value to return a collection of all the policies configured at the site scope; that's accomplished by using the filter value "site:*".
    The resulting collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsUserServicesPolicy` cmdlet, which deletes each policy in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsUserServicesPolicy | Where-Object {$_.UcsAllowed -eq $True} | Remove-CsUserServicesPolicy
  description: |-
    In Example 3, all the User Services policies that allow the use of the Unified Contact Store are deleted.
    To carry out this task, the command first calls the `Get-CsUserServicesPolicy` cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the User Services policies configured for use in the organization.
    That collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those policies where the UcsAllowed property is equal to (-eq) True ($True).
    Those policies are then piped to and removed by, the `Remove-CsUserServicesPolicy` cmdlet.

description: |-
  The unified contact store introduced in Lync Server 2013 gives administrators the option of storing a user's contacts in Exchange instead of in Skype for Business Server; in turn that allows the user to access the same set of contacts in Outlook and Outlook Web App as well as in Skype for Business.
  (Alternatively, you can continue to store contacts in Skype for Business Server.
  In that case, users will have to maintain two separate sets of contacts: one for use with Outlook and Outlook Web Access and one for use with Skype for Business.)

  In order to take advantage of the unified contact store you must (among other things) assign the user a user services policy that enables the use of the unified contact store.
  User service policies (which can be configured at the global, site, or the per-user scope) contain only a single property: UcsAllowed.
  When this property is set to True then (assuming all the other prerequisites have been met) the next time a user logs on to Skype for Business Server his or her contacts will automatically be migrated to the unified contact store.

  If this property is set to False this automatic migration will not take place.
  However, simply setting UcsAllowed will not cause a user's contacts to be moved from the unified contact store back to Skype for Business Server.
  In order to do that, you must first assign the user a user services policy that does not allow the use of the unified contact store.
  After that, you must then use the `Invoke-CsUcsRollback` cmdlet to "manually" migrate the contacts from the unified contact store back to Skype for Business Server.
