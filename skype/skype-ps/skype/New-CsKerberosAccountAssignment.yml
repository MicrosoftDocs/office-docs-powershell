  code: |-
    New-CsKerberosAccountAssignment -UserAccount "litwareinc\kerberostest" -Identity "site:Redmond"

    Enable-CsTopology
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 1 assign a Kerberos account (litwareinc\kerberostest) to the Redmond site, then call the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet in order to enable the assignment.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the New-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet to associate the account "litwareinc\kerberostest" with the Redmond site.
    The second command then calls the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet in order to create the required SPN in AD DS and enable the new assignment.

  In Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 and Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2, IIS ran under a standard user account.
  This had the potential to cause issues: if that password expired you could lose your Web Services, an issue that was often difficult to diagnose.
  To help avoid the issue of expiring passwords, Skype for Business Server enables you to create a computer account (for a computer that doesn't actually exist) that can serve as the authentication principal for all the computers in a site that are running IIS.
  Because these accounts use the Kerberos authentication protocol, the accounts are referred to as Kerberos accounts, and the new authentication process is known as Kerberos web authentication.
  This enables you to manage all your IIS servers by using a single account.

  To run your servers under this new authentication principal, you must first create a computer account by using the New-CsKerberosAccount cmdlet; this account is then assigned to one or more sites.
  After the assignment has been made, the association between the account and the Skype for Business Server site is enabled by running the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet.
  Among other things, this creates the required service principal name (SPN) in Active Directory Domain Services.
  SPNs provide a way for client applications to locate a particular service.

  The New-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet enables you to assign a Kerberos account to a site that is currently not associated with an account.
  To change a site that is already associated with a Kerberos account, use the Set-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet instead.
