# New-CsSipProxyCustom

## SYNOPSIS

Used to assign a custom realm (SIP Communications Service) to a collection of proxy configuration settings.
Realms (also known as protection domains) are used to authenticate user credentials during logon.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
New-CsSipProxyCustom -CustomValue <String> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Each proxy server must be associated with a realm; realms (also known as protection domains) indicate where a user's logon credentials should be processed.
By default, Skype for Business Server uses SIP Communications Service as its default realm; however, it is possible to change the realm used by a proxy server.
This is done by creating a SipProxy.Custom object and then assigning that object to the Realm property of the appropriate proxy server (or servers).
You can create a custom realm by using the New-CsSipProxyCustom cmdlet.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

$x = New-CsSipProxyCustom -CustomValue "Litwareinc Communications Service"
```

The command shown in Example 1 assigns a custom realm (Litwareinc Communications Service) to a variable named $x.
