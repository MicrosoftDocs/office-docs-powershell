### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Modifies an existing instant messaging (IM) archiving policy.
  An archiving policy gives you the ability to archive all IM sessions and conferences that take place between internal users; you can also archive sessions that take place between internal users and federated partners.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

    The `Set-CsArchivingPolicy` cmdlet does not return a value or object.
    Instead, the cmdlet configures instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Settings.Policy.IM.IMArchivingPolicy object.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsArchivingPolicy -Identity global -ArchiveInternal $True
  description: |-
    In this example, the `Set-CsArchivingPolicy` cmdlet is used to modify the global archiving policy.
    In this case, the ArchiveInternal property is set to True.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsArchivingPolicy | Set-CsArchivingPolicy -ArchiveInternal $True
  description: |-
    Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1.
    This time, however, all of the archiving policies in the organization are configured to allow for the archiving of IM sessions.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsArchivingPolicy` cmdlet to return a collection of all the IM session archiving policies currently in use.
    That collection is then piped to the `Set-CsArchivingPolicy` cmdlet, which sets the ArchiveInternal property of each policy to True.

description: |-
  Many organizations find it useful to keep an archive of all the IM sessions that their users take part in.
  Other organizations are legally required to keep such an archive.
  In order to archive IM sessions with Skype for Business Server, you must perform two steps.
  First, you need to enable archiving at the global and/or the site scope by using the `Set-CsArchivingConfiguration` cmdlet.
  This gives you the ability to archive IM sessions; however, it does not automatically begin archiving those sessions.

  To actually save transcripts of your IM sessions, you must complete step two: create one or more archiving policies that determine which users will have their IM sessions recorded and which type of IM sessions (internal and/or external) will be archived.
  Internal IM sessions are sessions where all the participants are authenticated users who have Active Directory accounts within your organization; external IM sessions are sessions where at least one participant is an unauthenticated user who does not have an Active Directory account within your organization.
  You can choose to archive only internal sessions, only external sessions, or both internal and external sessions.

  Archiving policies (created using the `New-CsArchivingPolicy` cmdlet) can be assigned to the global site or to the site scope.
  In addition, these policies can be assigned to the per-user scope; that means that a policy can be created and then applied to a specific user or group of users.
  For example, you might have a global policy that archives internal IM sessions for all of your users.
  In addition, you might create a second policy, one that archives both internal and external sessions and apply that second policy only to your sales staff.
  Because per-user policies take precedence over global and site policies, members of the sales staff will have all their IM sessions archived.
  Other users (users who are not part of the sales department and are not affected by the sales policy) will have only their internal IM sessions archived.

  The `Set-CsArchivingPolicy` cmdlet enables you to modify the property values for any of the IM session archiving policies currently in use in your organization.
