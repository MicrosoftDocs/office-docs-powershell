# Remove-CsServerApplication

## SYNOPSIS
Removes an existing server application.
Server applications are applications that are hosted by Skype for Business Server.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsServerApplication [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Server applications refer to the individual programs that run under Skype for Business Server.
The `Remove-CsServerApplication` cmdlet provides a way for administrators to remove any application running as part of Skype for Business Server.
Note that deleting a server application is not the same thing as uninstalling that application.
When you run the `Remove-CsServerApplication` cmdlet, the application no longer runs under Skype for Business Server.
However, the software itself is not uninstalled and the application can be re-enabled by running the `New-CsServerApplication` cmdlet.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Remove-CsServerApplication -Identity "service:EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor"
```

In Example 1, the server application that has the Identity service: EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com/EdgeMonitor is removed.
Because Identities must be unique, this command will never delete more than a single application.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Get-CsServerApplication | Where-Object {$_.Critical -eq $False} | Remove-CsServerApplication
```

In Example 2, all the non-critical server applications are removed.
To carry out this task, the command first calls the `Get-CsServerApplication` cmdlet in order to return a collection of all the server applications currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks all the applications where the Critical property is equal to False.
This filtered collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsServerApplication` cmdlet, which deletes each item in the collection.


### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------
```
Get-CsServerApplication -Filter "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/*" | Remove-CsServerApplication
```

Example 3 deletes all the server applications that have been configured for use by the service EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, the `Get-CsServerApplication` cmdlet is used along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/*" returns all the applications that have an Identity that begins with the characters "service:EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/".
In turn, that collection is piped to the `Remove-CsServerApplication` cmdlet, which deletes each application from the EdgeServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the server application to be removed.
Server application Identities are composed of the service where the application is hosted plus the application name.
For example, the server application named QoEAgent might have an Identity similar to this: service:Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/QoEAgent.
