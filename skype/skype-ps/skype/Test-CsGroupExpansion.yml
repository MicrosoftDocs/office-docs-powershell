description: |-
  Users sometimes need to communicate on a regular basis with all the members of an Active Directory distribution group; for example, that group might comprise all the members of a team or all the people assigned to a particular project.
  In recognition of this, Skype for Business Server allows you to configure a distribution group as a contact.
  If you do this, you can then send the same instant message to all the group members simply by addressing the message to the group rather than each individual member of that group.

  There might also be times when you need to communicate with (or check the presence of) certain individuals in the group.
  Group expansion enables you to quickly and easily view all the group members and their current status.
  In addition to that, you can also select one or more group members, and then send an instant message just to those users rather than to all the members of the group.

  Group expansion is enabled and disabled by using the `Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet.
  If group expansion is enabled, you can determine whether the feature is working by running the `Test-CsGroupExpansion` cmdlet.
  With this cmdlet, you specify an Active Directory distribution group by using the group's email address.
  The `Test-CsGroupExpansion` cmdlet then uses group expansion to retrieve the group membership and compare the retrieved list with the membership of the group email address that you supplied.
  If the two lists match, then group expansion is working correctly.

  Note that you can test group expansion in two different ways: by testing the service itself or by testing the associated web service.
