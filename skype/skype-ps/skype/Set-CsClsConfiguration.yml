### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Modifies an existing collection of centralized logging configuration settings.
  Centralized logging provides a way for administrators to simultaneously enable or disable tracing on multiple computers.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsClsConfiguration -Identity "global" -EtlRolloverFileSizeMB 40
  description: |-
    In Example 1, the global collection of centralized logging configuration settings is modified to set the maximum size of an ETL file to 40 megabytes.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsClsConfiguration | Set-CsClsConfiguration -EtlRolloverFileSizeMB 40
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 2 modifies the maximum ETL file size for all the centralized logging configuration settings in use in the organization.
    To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsClsConfiguration` cmdlet to return a collection of all the centralized logging settings.
    That collection is then piped to the `Set-CsClsConfiguration` cmdlet, which changes the value of the EtlRolloverFileSizeMB property for each item in the collection to 40 megabytes.

description: |-
  The centralized logging service (which replaces the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides a way for administrators to manage logging and tracing for all computers and pools running Skype for Business Server.
  Centralized logging enables administrators to stop, start and configure logging for one or more pools and computers by using a single command; for example, you can use one command to enable Address Book service logging on all your Address Book servers.
  This differs from the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools, which had to be individually managed (including individually stopped and started) on each server.
  In addition, the centralized logging service also provides a way for administrators to search trace logs from the command, using the Windows PowerShell command-line interface and the `Search-CsClsLogging` cmdlet.

  Centralized logging is built around a series of predefined scenarios that offer a more finely-targeted approach to logging than offered in previous versions of Skype for Business Server.
  These scenarios predetermine the server components and logging for you; as a result, an administrator enabling the RGS scenario can be confident that he or she will only log information relevant to the Response Group service and not to, say, the audio conferencing provider service.

  It is also possible to define custom scenarios by using the `New-CsClsScenario` cmdlet.

  Centralized logging is managed by using collections of centralized logging service configuration settings.
  When you install Skype for Business Server, you install a global set of these configuration settings; in addition, administrators can add custom settings collections at the site scope.
  Administrators can use the `Set-CsClsConfiguration` cmdlet to modify any of these settings.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Set-CsClsConfiguration` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
