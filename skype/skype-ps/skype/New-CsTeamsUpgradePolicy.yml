  In on-premises deployments of Skype for Business Server, TeamsUpgradePolicy enables administrators to control whether users see a notification of a pending upgrade to Teams in their Skype for Business client. The new-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy lets the administrator create a policy that can be assigned to users homed in Skype for Business on-premises to notify of them of a pending upgrade to Teams. Notifications are enabled by the boolean parameter NotifySfBUsers.

  For users with Win32 versions of Skype for Business, if DownloadTeams=true in CsTeamsUpgradeConfiguration, users who are assigned an instance of TeamsUpgradePolicy with NotifySfBUsers=true will have Teams automatically downloaded in the background.

  Notes:
  * Instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy created in on-premises will not apply to any users that are already homed online.
  * Skype for Business Online already provides built-in instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy, so there is no New-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy cmdlet for the online environment by design.
