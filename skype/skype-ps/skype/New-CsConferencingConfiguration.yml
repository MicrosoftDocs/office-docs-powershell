### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a new collection of conference configuration settings.
  Conference settings determine such things as the maximum-allowed size for conference content and handouts, the content grace period (that is, the amount of time content will be stored before being deleted), and the URLs for the internal and external downloads of the supported client.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server.

  code: |-
    New-CsConferencingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -Organization Litwareinc
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of conferencing configuration settings for the Redmond site (site:Redmond).
    In this example, one additional parameter is included (Organization) which is used to set the value of the Organization property to Litwareinc.
    Note that this command will fail if the Redmond site already has a collection of conferencing configuration settings.
    That's because you can have only one such collection per site.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $x = New-CsConferencingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -InMemory

    $x.Organization = "Litwareinc"

    Set-CsConferencingConfiguration -Instance $x
  description: |-
    In Example 2, a new collection of conferencing configuration settings is initially created in memory only; these virtual settings are only later applied to the Redmond site.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the New-CsConferencingConfiguration cmdlet to create a new, in-memory collection of settings stored in the variable $x; the InMemory parameter specifies that the collection should be created in memory rather than immediately applied to the Redmond site.

    After the collection has been created, the second command sets the value of the Organization property to Litwareinc.
    Finally, the third command uses the Set-CsConferencingConfiguration cmdlet to actually apply the new settings to the Redmond site.
    (This command will fail if conferencing configuration settings have already been applied to site:Redmond.) If you do not call the Set-CsConferencingConfiguration cmdlet the new settings will never take effect.
    Instead, they will disappear as soon as you end your Windows PowerShell session or delete the variable $x.

description: |-
  For conferences, management and administration is split between two sets of cmdlets.
  If you want to manage the things users can and cannot do (for example, can users invite anonymous participants to join a conference, are users allowed to offer application sharing in a conference, or are users allowed to transfer files within a conference), then you need to use the CsConferencingPolicy cmdlets.

  Administrators also need to manage the Web Conferencing service.
  For example, administrators need to be able to do such things as specify the maximum amount of content storage allotted to a single conference and to specify the grace period before that conference content is automatically deleted.
  They also need to be able to specify the ports used for activities such as application sharing and file transfer.

  These latter activities can be managed by using the CsConferencingConfiguration cmdlets.
  These cmdlets enable you to manage the actual servers themselves.
  The CsConferencingConfiguration cmdlets (which can be applied to the global, the site, and the service scopes) aren't used to specify whether or not a user can share applications during a conference; if application sharing is allowed, however, these cmdlets enable you to indicate which ports should be used for that activity.
  Likewise, the cmdlets enable you to specify such things as storage limits and expiration periods, as well as pointers to internal and external URLs where users can obtain conferencing help and resources.

  When you install Skype for Business Server, the system provides you with a single collection of conferencing configuration settings (the global collection).
  If you need to create custom settings for a site or service, you can do so using the New-CsConferencingConfiguration cmdlet.
  Note that new settings can be applied only at the site or service scope; you cannot create a new global collection of conferencing configuration settings.
  In addition, no site or service can host more than one collection of settings.
  If you try to create new settings for the Redmond site and the Redmond site already hosts a collection of conferencing configuration settings, then your command will fail.
