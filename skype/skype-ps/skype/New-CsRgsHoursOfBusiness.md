# New-CsRgsHoursOfBusiness

## SYNOPSIS

Creates a new set of Response Group application business hours.
Business hour sets are used to indicate the days of the week and the times of day when Response Group agents are typically available to answer phone calls.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
New-CsRgsHoursOfBusiness [-Parent] <RgsIdentity> -Name <String> [-Custom <Boolean>] [-MondayHours1 <TimeRange>]
 [-MondayHours2 <TimeRange>] [-TuesdayHours1 <TimeRange>] [-TuesdayHours2 <TimeRange>]
 [-WednesdayHours1 <TimeRange>] [-WednesdayHours2 <TimeRange>] [-ThursdayHours1 <TimeRange>]
 [-ThursdayHours2 <TimeRange>] [-FridayHours1 <TimeRange>] [-FridayHours2 <TimeRange>]
 [-SaturdayHours1 <TimeRange>] [-SaturdayHours2 <TimeRange>] [-SundayHours1 <TimeRange>]
 [-SundayHours2 <TimeRange>] [-InMemory] [-Force] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

In order to provide callers with the best possible experience, the Response Group application makes it possible for you to clearly define when Response Group agents are available to answer calls and when they are not available to answer calls.
With the Response Group application, you can define business hours; these hours indicate the days of the week and hours of the day that agents are available to answer calls.
For example, if your organization is typically open from 9:00 A.M.
to 5:00 P.M.
Monday through Friday then you would configure business hours that show that agents are available from 9:00 A.M.
to 5:00 P.M.
Monday through Friday (and, by extension, that agents are not available at, say, 8:00 P.M.
on a Thursday or 2:30 P.M.
on a Sunday).

New business hour sets are created by using the New-CsRgsHoursOfBusiness cmdlet.
When configuring business hours within a business hour set, keep in mind that each day of the week has both an Hours1 and an Hours2 property.
If your help desk is open from 8:00 A.M to 5:00 P.M., you only need to assign values to the appropriate Hours1 property.
However, suppose the help desk is open from 8:00 A.M.
to 2:00 P.M., then open again from 5:00 P.M.
until 11:00 P.M..
In that case you need to assign the time range 8:00 A.M.
to 2:00 P.M.
to Hours1 and 5:00 P.M.
to 11:00 P.M.
to Hours2.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

New-CsRgsHoursOfBusiness -Parent "service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Name "Help Desk Business Hours"
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new business hours set named Help Desk Business Hours on ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In this example, no business hours are configured for the set.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- 
```

$weekday = New-CsRgsTimeRange -Name "Weekday Hours" -OpenTime "8:00" -CloseTime "18:00"

New-CsRgsHoursOfBusiness -Parent "service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Name "Help Desk Business Hours" -MondayHours1 $weekday -TuesdayHours1 $weekday -WednesdayHours1 $weekday -ThursdayHours1 $weekday -FridayHours1 $weekday
```

In Example 2, a new business hours set named Help Desk Business Hours is created on ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In this example, business hours are configured for each day of the week, Monday through Friday.
To do this, the first command in the example uses the New-CsRgsTimeRange command to create a time range with an OpenTime of 8:00 AM (8:00) and a CloseTime of 6:00 PM (18:00).
This time range is stored in a variable named $weekday.

The second command in the example then creates the new business hours set.
In addition to specifying the set's Parent and Name, additional parameters (such as MondayHours1) are used to configure business hours for the weekdays Monday through Friday.
In each case, those business hours are set to 8:00 A.M.
to 6:00 P.M., and by using the time range variable $weekday.


## PARAMETERS
