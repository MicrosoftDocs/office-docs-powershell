  The unified contact store (introduced in Lync Server 2013 enables users to access their contact list from multiple applications, including Skype for Business, Outlook, and Outlook Web App.
  This access is made available by storing contact information in a single location: Exchange.

  The Debug-CsUnifiedContactStore cmdlet enables administrators to verify whether a specific user or a specific set of users (that is, all the users with accounts homed in a particular pool) have their contact lists stored in the unified contact store.
  If you run the Debug-CsUnifiedContactStore cmdlet against a specific user account, the cmdlet will indicate whether that user's contacts have been moved for the unified contact store, the number of attempts that have been made to move those contacts, and the date and time when Skype for Business Server last tried to migrate the contact list.
  When called against a pool, the Debug-CsUnifiedContactStore cmdlet returns data similar to this:

  FrontEnd: atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com UcsDisabledCount: 44UcsAllowedCount: 129UcsMigratingCount: 11UcsMigratedCount: FailedUserData:

  The Debug-CsUnifiedContactStore cmdlet, and the ContactDataExportFileName parameter, can also be used to export contact information for a user to an XML file.

  The functions carried out by the Debug-CsUnifiedContactStore cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
