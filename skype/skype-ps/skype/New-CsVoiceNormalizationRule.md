# New-CsVoiceNormalizationRule

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a new voice normalization rule.
Voice normalization rules are used to convert a telephone dialing requirement (for example, dialing 9 to access an outside line) to the E.164 phone number format used by Skype for Business Server.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet creates a named voice normalization rule.
These rules are a required part of phone authorization and call routing.
They define the requirements for converting (or translating) numbers from an internal Skype for Business Server format to a standard (E.164) format.
An understanding of regular expressions is helpful in order to define number patterns that will be translated.

Rules that are created by using this cmdlet are part of the dial plan and in addition to being accessible through the `Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet, can also be accessed through the NormalizationRules property returned by a call to the `Get-CsDialPlan` cmdlet.
You cannot create a normalization rule unless a dial plan with an Identity matching the scope specified in the normalization rule Identity already exists.
For example, you can't create a normalization rule with the Identity site:Redmond/RedmondNormalizationRule unless a dial plan for site:Redmond already exists.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
New-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity "site:Redmond/Prefix Redmond"
```

This example creates a new voice normalization rule for site Redmond named Prefix Redmond.
Because no other parameters are specified, the rule is created with the default values.
Notice that the value passed to the Identity parameter is in double quotes; this is because the name of the rule (Prefix Redmond) contains a space.
If the rule name does not contain a space you don't need to enclose the Identity in double quotes.

Keep in mind that a dial plan for the Redmond site must exist for this command to succeed.
You can create a new dial plan by calling the `New-CsDialPlan` cmdlet.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
New-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Parent SeattleUser -Name SeattleFourDigit -Description "Dialing with internal four-digit extension" -Pattern '^(\d{4})$' -Translation '+1206555$1'
```

This example creates a new voice normalization rule named SeattleFourDigit that applies to the per-user dial plan with the Identity SeattleUser.
(Note: Rather than specifying a Parent and a Name, we could have instead created this same rule by specifying -Identity SeattleUser/SeattleFourDigit.) We've included a Description explaining that this rule is for translating numbers dialed internally with only a 4-digit extension.
In addition, Pattern and Translation values have been specified.
These values translate a four-digit number (specified by the regular expression in the Pattern) to the same four-digit number, but prefixed by the Translation value (+1206555).
For example, if the extension 1234 was entered, this rule would translate that extension to the number +12065551234.

Note the single quotes around the Pattern and Translation values.
Single quotes are required for these values; double quotes (or no quotes) will not work in this instance.

As in Example 1, a dial plan with the given scope must exist.
In this case, that means a dial plan with the Identity SeattleUser must already exist.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
A unique identifier for the rule.
The Identity specified must include the scope followed by a slash and then the name; for example: site:Redmond/Rule1, where site:Redmond is the scope and Rule1 is the name.
The name portion will automatically be stored in the Name property.
You cannot specify values for Identity and Name in the same command.

Voice normalization rules can be created at the following scopes: global, site, service (Registrar and PSTNGateway only) and per user.
A dial plan with an Identity matching the scope of the normalization rule must already exist before a new rule can be created.
(To retrieve a list of dial plans, call the `Get-CsDialPlan` cmdlet.)

The Identity parameter is required unless the Parent parameter is specified.
You cannot include the Identity parameter and the Parent parameter in the same command.

### -Name
The name of the rule.
This parameter is required if a value has been specified for the Parent parameter.
If no value has been specified for the Parent parameter, Name defaults to the name specified in the Identity parameter.
For example, if a rule is created with the Identity site:Redmond/RedmondRule, the Name will default to RedmondRule.
The Name parameter and the Identity parameter cannot be used in the same command.

A dial plan with the specified scope must already exist or the command will fail.
