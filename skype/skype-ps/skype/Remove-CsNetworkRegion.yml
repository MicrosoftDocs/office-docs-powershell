- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Remove-CsNetworkRegion -Identity NorthAmerica
  description: |-
    Example 1 removes the network region with the Identity NorthAmerica.
    Because identities are unique this command removes only one network region.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkRegion | Where-Object {$_.CentralSite -eq "site:Redmond"} | Remove-CsNetworkRegion
  description: |-
    This example removes all network regions associated with the central site Redmond.
    The command begins by calling the `Get-CsNetworkRegion` cmdlet, with no parameters, to retrieve a collection of all network regions defined for the Skype for Business Server deployment.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet.
    The `Where-Object` cmdlet filters this collection to return only those items (network regions) where the CentralSite value is equal to (-eq) site:Redmond.
    After narrowing the collection down to those items, this new collection is piped to the `Remove-CsNetworkRegion` cmdlet, which removes every item in that collection.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkSite | Where-Object {$_.NetworkRegionID -eq "NorthAmerica"} | Set-CsNetworkSite -NetworkRegionID $null -BypassID $null

    Remove-CsNetworkRegion -Identity "NorthAmerica"
  description: |-
    This example removes the network region with the Identity NorthAmerica.
    However, a region cannot be removed if it is associated with a site.
    So this example first removes any association between the NorthAmerica region and a site.

    The example begins by calling the `Get-CsNetworkSite` cmdlet, with no parameters, to retrieve a collection of all network sites defined for the Skype for Business Server deployment.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet.
    The `Where-Object` cmdlet filters this collection to return only those items (network sites) where the NetworkRegionID value is equal to (-eq) NorthAmerica.
    After narrowing the collection down to those items, this new collection is piped to the `Set-CsNetworkSite` cmdlet.
    For each site containing the NetworkRegionID NorthAmerica, we set the NetworkRegionID to Null ($null).
    This removes the reference to the region on that site.
    However, a site can't have a bypass ID if it isn't associated with a site.
    So in addition to removing the reference to the region by setting the NetworkRegionID to Null, we must also remove the bypass association by setting BypassID to Null.

    After line 1 completes, any site that was associated with the NorthAmerica region is no longer tied to a region or to any bypass settings.
    At this point we can call line 2, which removes the network region.

name: Remove-CsNetworkRegion
description: |-
  A network region interconnects various parts of a network across multiple geographic areas.
  Every network region must be associated with a central site.
  The central site is the data center site on which the bandwidth policy service is running.
  Use this cmdlet to remove a network region.

  Note that a network region cannot be removed if it is associated with a network site (in other words, the NetworkRegionID of any site is equal to the Identity of the region).
  If you attempt to remove a region associated with a site you'll receive an error message.
