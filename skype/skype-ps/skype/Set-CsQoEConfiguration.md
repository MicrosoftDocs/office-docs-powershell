# Set-CsQoEConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Modifies an existing collection of QoE (Quality of Experience) settings.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Set-CsQoEConfiguration [[-Identity] <XdsIdentity>] [-EnableExternalConsumer <Boolean>]
 [-EnablePurging <Boolean>] [-EnableQoE <Boolean>] [-ExternalConsumerIssuedCertId <IssuedCertId>]
 [-ExternalConsumerName <String>] [-ExternalConsumerURL <String>] [-KeepQoEDataForDays <UInt32>]
 [-PurgeHourOfDay <UInt32>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Instance
```
Set-CsQoEConfiguration [-Instance <PSObject>] [-EnableExternalConsumer <Boolean>] [-EnablePurging <Boolean>]
 [-EnableQoE <Boolean>] [-ExternalConsumerIssuedCertId <IssuedCertId>] [-ExternalConsumerName <String>]
 [-ExternalConsumerURL <String>] [-KeepQoEDataForDays <UInt32>] [-PurgeHourOfDay <UInt32>] [-Force] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
QoE metrics track the quality of audio and video calls made in your organization, including such things as the number of network packets lost, background noise and the amount of "jitter" (differences in packet delay).
These metrics are stored in a database apart from other data (such as call detail records), which allows you to enable and disable QoE independent of other data recording.
Use this cmdlet to modify settings that configure QoE at the global or site level.

QoE is part of the Monitoring Server role; therefore Monitoring Server must be deployed on your Skype for Business Server installation before QoE recording takes effect or any QoE data can be collected.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsQoEConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EnableQoE $False
```

The command in Example 1 uses the `Set-CsQoEConfiguration` cmdlet to modify the Quality of Experience settings for the Redmond site (-Identity site:Redmond).
The new settings turn off QoE by setting the EnableQoE parameter to False.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Set-CsQoEConfiguration -Identity site:Dublin -KeepQoEDataForDays 45 -PurgeHourOfDay 4
```

This command modifies QoE settings that apply to the Dublin site.
In this example we've set the KeepQoEDataForDays parameter to 45, so QoE data will be purged from the database after 45 days.
In addition, we've set the PurgeHourOfDay parameter to 4, meaning any data older than the 45 days we just specified will be purged at 4:00 AM.

Note: If you have enabled QoE and call detail recording (CDR), for performance reasons it's a good idea to make sure the PurgeHourOfDay setting is different for QoE than for CDR.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The unique identifier of the settings you want to modify.
Possible values are global and site:\<site name\>, where \<site name\> is the name of the site in your Skype for Business Server deployment to which you want to apply the changes.
