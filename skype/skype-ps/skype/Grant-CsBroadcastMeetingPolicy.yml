  Administrators can manage Broadcast meeting functionality in Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business Online using the following:

  - Broadcast meeting configuration at the tenant level
  - Broadcast meeting policy at the user level
  - Conferencing  policy at the user level.

  Broadcast meeting configuration and broadcast meeting policy govern broadcast-specific functionality. In addition, the settings of the conferencing policy assigned to the user producing the broadcast also general conferencing settings that are also relevant for broadcast meetings.  

  This document describes how to specify which broadcast meeting policy is assigned to a user. Be sure to also review the following docs to manage conferencing policy:[Grant-CsConferencingPolicy](Grant-CsConferencingPolicy.yml), [New-CsConferencingPolicy](New-CsConferencingPolicy.yml), and [Set-CsConferencingPolicy](Set-CsConferencingPolicy.yml).

  **NOTES**:

  - Broadcast meeting policies are predefined in Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business. The defined settings for each policy can be displayed by using the Get-CsBroadcastMeetingPolicy cmdlet with no parameters.
  - New broadcast meeting policy instance can't be created, and existing policies can't be modified. They can only be granted, or assigned to users.
