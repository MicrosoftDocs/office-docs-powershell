# New-CsNetworkSubnet

## SYNOPSIS

Creates a new network subnet.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
New-CsNetworkSubnet [-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity> -MaskBits <Int32> [-Description <String>]
 [-NetworkSiteID <String>] [-Force] [-InMemory] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ParentAndRelativeKey
```
New-CsNetworkSubnet -MaskBits <Int32> -SubnetID <String> [-Description <String>] [-NetworkSiteID <String>]
 [-Force] [-InMemory] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Each subnet must be associated with a network site for the purposes of determining the geographic location of the host belonging to this subnet.
Use this cmdlet to create a new subnet, and at the same time (optionally) assign it to a network site.

In most deployments of Skype for Business Server where call admission control (CAC) is implemented, there will typically be a large number of subnets.
Because of this, it's often best to call the New-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet in conjunction with the Import-CSV cmdlet.
By using these cmdlets together, you can read in subnet settings from a comma-separated values (CSV) file and create multiple subnets at once.
For more details, see the Examples section for this cmdlet.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```
New-CsNetworkSubnet -Identity 172.11.15.0 -MaskBits 24 -NetworkSiteID Vancouver
```

This example demonstrates how to create a new subnet object that represents the subnet 172.11.15.0/24.
The Identity of the subnet is set to 172.11.15.0.
This value will automatically be assigned as the SubnetID.
A subnet must have mask bits defined.
That is done by supplying a value--in this case 24--to the MaskBits parameter.
Finally, the site ID Vancouver is passed to the NetworkSiteID parameter to associate this subnet with that site.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- 
```

Import-CSV C:\subnet.csv | foreach {New-CsNetworkSubnet -Identity $_.Identity -MaskBits $_.Mask -NetworkSiteID $_.SiteID}
```

Example 2 reads from a CSV file to create a series of subnets.
The CSV file in this example looks something like this:

Identity, Mask, SiteID

172.11.12.0, 24, Redmond

172.11.13.0, 24, Chicago

172.11.14.0, 25, Vancouver

172.11.15.0, 31, Paris

...

The example starts by calling the Import-CSV cmdlet, passing it the path to a CSV file.
This cmdlet will read the contents of that file into memory.
Those file contents are then piped to the foreach function.
The foreach function iterates through the contents one line at a time.
As you can see from the example file, the first line is a list of headings that define the rest of the contents; the foreach function will use these headings to access the comma-separated values by name.

Inside the foreach statement, the New-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet is called.
As foreach iterates through each line of the file contents, that line is passed as the values for the New-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet parameters.
For example, the first time through the foreach statement, the New-CsNetworkSubnet cmdlet will create a subnet with the Identity 172.11.12.0: this is the value in the Identity position in the first comma-separated line of values.
(The $_ indicates the current value in the foreach loop.) The Mask value (24) is then passed to the MaskBits parameter, and the SiteID value (Redmond) from the file is passed to the NetworkSiteID parameter.

This process continues until all lines in the file have been read, and their values used to create new subnets.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The unique subnet ID of the subnet being created.
This must be an IP address (such as 174.11.12.0), and it must be the first address in the IP address range defined by the subnet.

```yaml
Type: XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MaskBits
The bitmask to be applied to the subnet being created.

Valid values: 1 through 32

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SubnetID
This is the same value as the Identity.
You must specify either an Identity or a SubnetID, but you cannot specify both.
Whatever value you supply to one will automatically be applied to the other.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ParentAndRelativeKey
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Description
A description of the subnet being created.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NetworkSiteID
The site ID of the site to which this subnet belongs.
You can retrieve site IDs for your deployment by calling the Get-CsNetworkSite cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

```

### -Force
Suppresses any confirmation prompts that would otherwise be displayed before making changes.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter

Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InMemory

Creates an object reference without actually committing the object as a permanent change.
If you assign the output of this cmdlet called with this parameter to a variable, you can make changes to the properties of the object reference and then commit those changes by calling this cmdlet's matching Set-\<cmdlet\>.



```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
