# Debug-CsAddressBookReplication

## SYNOPSIS
Verifies replication between Active Directory and the Skype for Business Server Address book service.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.


## SYNTAX

```
Debug-CsAddressBookReplication [-DomainController <String>] [-Force] [-OutLoggerVariable <String>]
 [-OutVerboseVariable <String>] [-PoolFqdn <Fqdn>] [-User <String>] [-VerifyNormalization] [-VerifyReplication]
 [-AnalyzeFailures] [-StartDate <DateTime>] [-Tenant <Guid>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Address Book servers are intermediaries between Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Skype for Business Server.
The Address Book server ensures that the user information stored in Skype for Business Server is in sync with the user information stored in Active Directory.
This is done by periodically syncing Address Book files with information stored in the User database.

The Debug-CsAddressBookReplication cmdlet enables administrators to verify that data is being replicated between Active Directory and Skype for Business Server.
Fully testing replication between Active Directory and the Address Book server can potentially be time-consuming and resource-intensive; because of that, it is recommended that Debug-CsAddressBookReplication only be used in troubleshooting scenarios.
If you want to periodically "spot check" the functioning of your Address Book server you should use the Test-CsAddressBookService cmdlet and/or the Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery cmdlet instead.

The functions carried out by the Debug-CsAddressBookReplication cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Debug-CsAddressBookReplication
```

The command shown in Example 1 verifies Address book replication for the current pool.
To verify replication for a specified pool, include the PoolFqdn parameter followed by the fully qualified domain name of the pool to be verified.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Debug-CsAddressBookReplication -User "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"
```

In Example 2, the User parameter is included when verifying Address book replication for the current pool.
When the User parameter is included, additional related information is returned for the specified user.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Debug-CsAddressBookReplication -User "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -VerifyReplication
```

Example 3 uses the VerifyReplication parameter to make a change to the specified user account and then verify that this change can be successfully replicated to the Address Book.

### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```
Debug-CsAddressBookReplication -VerifyNormalization
```

The command shown in Example 4 uses the VerifyNormalization parameter to return information about user accounts where Address Book normalization rules could not be applied.


## PARAMETERS

### -DomainController
Enables you to specify a domain controller to connect to when verifying Address book replication.
If this parameter is not included then the cmdlet will use the first available domain controller.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: DC
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
Suppresses the display of any non-fatal error message that might occur when running the command.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OutLoggerVariable
When present, detailed output from running the cmdlet will be stored in the specified variable.
This variable includes a pair of methods - ToHTML and ToXML - that can then be used to save that output to either an HTML or an XML file.

To store output in a logger variable named $TestOutput use the following syntax:

`-OutLoggerVariable TestOutput`

Note: Do not prepend a $ character when specifying the variable name.

To save the information stored in the logger variable to an HTML file, use a command similar to this:

`$TestOutput.ToHTML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.html`

To save the information stored in the logger variable to an XML file, use a command similar to this:

`$TestOutput.ToXML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.xml`

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: olv
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OutVerboseVariable
When present, detailed output from running the cmdlet will be stored in the specified variable.
For example, to store output in a variable named $TestOutput use the following syntax

`-OutVerboseVariable TestOutput`

Do not prepend a $ character when specifying the variable name.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: ovv
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PoolFqdn
Fully qualified domain name of the pool being checked.
If this parameter is not included then the Debug-CsAddressBookReplication cmdlet will verify the current pool.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -User
When included, returns detailed replication information for the specified user accounts.
The user account to be verified can be specified by using the user's SIP address, email address, or SamAccountName.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -VerifyNormalization
If specified, detailed information will be returned for any user accounts where Address book normalization failed.
Normalization rules are used to convert phone numbers to the E.164 format used by Skype for Business Server.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
