examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsPresenceProvider
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 returns information about all the presence providers configured for use in your organization.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsPresenceProvider -Identity "global/fabrikam.com"
  description: |-
    Example 2 returns information about a single presence provider: the provider with the Identity global/fabrikam.com.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsPresenceProvider -Filter "site:*"
  description: |-
    In Example 3, information is returned for all the presence providers configured at the site scope.
    To do this, the Filter parameter is used along with the filter value "site:*".
    That filter value limits returned data to presence providers that have an Identity that begins with the string value "site:".
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsPresenceProvider | Where-Object {$_.Fqdn -match "fabrikam.com"}
  description: |-
    Example 4 returns all the presence providers that have the string value "fabrikam.com" somewhere in their Fqdn property.
    To carry out this task, the command first uses the Get-CsPresenceProvider cmdlet to return a collection of all the presence providers configured for use in the organization.
    That collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those providers where the Fqdn property includes (-match) the string value "fabrikam.com".

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Enables you to use wildcards when specifying the Identity of the presence provider (or providers) to be returned.
    For example, to return all the presence providers configured at the service scope use this filter value:

    `-Filter "service:*"`

    You cannot use both the Filter parameter and the Identity parameter in the same command.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="XdsIdentity" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    Unique identifier for the presence provider.
    The Identity of a presence provider is composed of two parts: the scope (Parent) where the provider has been applied (for example, service:UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com) and the provider's fully qualified domain name.
    For example, to retrieve a single presence provider use syntax similar to this:

    `-Identity "global/fabrikam.com"`

    To return all the presence providers for a specific parent, simply specify the scope.
    For example, this syntax returns all the presence providers configured for the global scope:

    `-Identity "global"`

    If neither the Identity nor the Filter parameters are included, then the Get-CsPresenceProvider cmdlet returns information about all your providers.

  The CsPresenceProvider cmdlets are used to manage the PresenceProviders property found in the User Services configuration settings.
  Among other things, these settings are used to maintain presence information, including a collection of authorized presence providers.
  That collection is stored in the PresenceProviders property.
  The Get-CsPresenceProvider cmdlet provides a way for you to return information about the presence providers that have been authorized for use in your organization.

  The functions carried out by the Get-CsPresenceProvider cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
