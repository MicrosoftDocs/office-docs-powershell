# Import-CsRgsConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS

Imports Response Group configuration data that was previously exported using the Export-CsRgsConfiguration cmdlet.
The ability to export and import Response Group configuration data is particularly useful disaster recovery scenarios.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.



## SYNTAX

```
Import-CsRgsConfiguration -Destination <RgsIdentity> -FileName <String> [-Force] [-OverwriteOwner]
 [-ReplaceExistingRgsSettings] [-ResolveNameConflicts] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The Export-CsRgsConfiguration cmdlet and the Import-CsRgsConfiguration cmdlet enable you to export data about your current implementation of the Response Group application (including such things as workflows, queues, agent groups, holiday sets and business hours, as well as audio files and service configuration settings) and then later import (or re-import) that information.
This can be extremely useful in a disaster recovery scenario (for example, in a case where the server hosting the Response Group application has failed) or if you simply need to transfer the Response Group application to a different pool.

Note that the Export-CsRgsConfiguration cmdlet and the Import-CsRgsConfiguration cmdlet are designed to work only with Lync Server 2013 and Skype for Business Server.
If you want to migrate Response Group data from Microsoft Lync Server 2010 to Skype for Business Server, you should use the Move-CsRgsConfiguration cmdlet instead.

Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the Import-CsRgsConfiguration cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- 
```

Import-CsRgsConfiguration -FileName "C:\Export\RgsExport.zip" -Destination "ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

The command shown in Example 1 imports a previously exported collection of Response Group application settings, and then applies those settings to the Response Group installation hosted by the Application Server on atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
