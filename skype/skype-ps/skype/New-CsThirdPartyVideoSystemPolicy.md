# New-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a new third-party video system policy for use with video teleconferencing (VTC) devices.
These policies determine whether or not the VTC is allowed to send low-resolution video.

## SYNTAX

```
New-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Confirm] [-Force] [-InMemory]
 [-SupportsSendingLowResolution <Boolean>] [-Tenant <Guid>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Third-party video systems are VTC devices that provide remote users with telepresence capabilities (most notably audio and video).
In Skype for Business Server, third-party VTC devices can be configured as Active Directory contact objects, much in the same way that analog phones and common area phones can be configured as contact objects.
Associating each VTC device with a contact object makes it easy for administrators to track and to manage, these devices.

One key management task related to VTC devices is to enable (or disable) the ability of these devices to send low-resolution video.
By default, VTC devices are allowed to send low-resolution video.
However, administrators can create third-party video system policies that disable the use of low-resolution video.
This might be useful for devices located in conference rooms or other areas where low-resolution video is not considered acceptable.
The `New-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem` cmdlet provides a way for administrators to create these third-party video system policies.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
New-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy -Identity "site:Redmond" -SupportsSendingLowResolution $False
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new third-party video system policy assigned to the Redmond site.
With this policy, VTCs will not be allowed to send low resolution video; that's because the SupportsSendingLowResolution parameter has been set to False ($False).


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Indicates the unique Identity to be assigned to the policy.
Third party video system policies can be created at the site or per-user scope.
To create a policy at the site scope, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity "site:Redmond"`.
To create a policy at the per-user scope, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity "RedmondVideoSystemPolicy"`.
