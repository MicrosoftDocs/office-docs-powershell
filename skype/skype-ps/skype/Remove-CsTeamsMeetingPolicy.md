# Remove-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
The `CsTeamsMeetingPolicy` cmdlets removes a previously created TeamsMeetingPolicy.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy [-Tenant <Guid>] [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Deletes a previously created TeamsMeetingPolicy. Any users with no explicitly assigned policies will then fall back to the default policy in the organization. You cannot delete the global policy from the organization. If you want to remove policies currently assigned to one or more users, you should assign a different policy to them before.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity StudentMeetingPolicy
```

In the example shown above, the command will delete the student meeting policy from the organization's list of policies and remove all assignments of this policy from users who have had the policy assigned.

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
The Force switch specifies whether to suppress warning and confirmation messages. It can be useful in scripting to suppress interactive prompts. If the Force switch isn't provided in the command, you're prompted for administrative input if required.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the teams meeting policy to be removed. To remove the global policy, use this syntax: -Identity global. (Note that the global policy cannot actually be removed. Instead, all the policy properties will be reset to their default values.) To remove a custom policy, use this syntax: -Identity StudentMeetingPolicy.

```yaml
Type: XdsIdentity
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Tenant
Globally unique identifier (GUID) of the tenant account whose external user communication policy are being created. For example:

-Tenant "38aad667-af54-4397-aaa7-e94c79ec2308"

You can return your tenant ID by running this command:

Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID

If you are using a remote session of Windows PowerShell and are connected only to Skype for Business Online you do not have to include the Tenant parameter. Instead, the tenant ID will automatically be filled in for you based on your connection information. The Tenant parameter is primarily for use in a hybrid deployment.

```yaml
Type: Guid
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
