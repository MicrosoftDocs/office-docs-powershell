    Test-CsUcwaConference -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"

    The command shown in Example 1 verifies that a pair of test users can participate in an UCWA conference on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    Note that this command will fail if you have not predefined a pair of health monitoring configuration test users for atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $cred1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"

    $cred2 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

    Test-CsUcwaConference -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -OrganizerSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -OrganizerCredential $cred1 -ParticipantSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -ParticipantCredential $cred2
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 test the ability of a pair of users (litwareinc\pilar and litwareinc\kenmyer) to participate in an UCWA conference.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell command-line interface credential object containing the name and password of the user Pilar Ackerman.
    (Because the logon name, litwareinc\pilar, has been included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box only requires the administrator to enter the password for the Pilar Ackerman account.) The resulting credentials object is then stored in a variable named $cred1.
    The second command does the same thing, this time returning a credential object for the Ken Myer account.

    With the two credential objects in hand, the third command in the example determines whether or not the two users can participate in an UCWA conference.
    To carry out this task, the `Test-CsUcwaConference` cmdlet is called, along with the following parameters: TargetFqdn (the FQDN of the Registrar pool); OrganizerSipAddress (the SIP address for the meeting organizer); OrganizerCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for this same user); ParticipantSipAddress (the SIP address for the other test user); and ParticipantCredential (the Windows PowerShell command-line interface object containing the credentials for the other user).

    When present, detailed output from running the cmdlet will be stored in the specified variable.
    This variable includes a pair of methods - ToHTML and ToXML - that can then be used to save that output to either an HTML or an XML file.

    To store output in a logger variable named $TestOutput use the following syntax:

    `-OutLoggerVariable TestOutput`

    Note: Do not prepend a $ character when specifying the variable name.

    To save the information stored in the logger variable to an HTML file, use a command similar to this:

    `$TestOutput.ToHTML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.html`

    To save the information stored in the logger variable to an XML file, use a command similar to this:

    `$TestOutput.ToXML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.xml`

  The `Test-CsUcwaConference` cmdlet verifies that a pair of test users can schedule, join, and then conduct an online conference using the Unified Communications Web API (UCWA).
  To do this, the cmdlet uses the Skype for Business Server web ticket service to authenticate the two test users and register them with Skype for Business Server.
  The cmdlet then starts a conference using the organizer credentials and invites the participant to join the meeting.
  After the meeting has been joined, the `Test-CsUcwaConference` cmdlet verifies that the users can do such things as exchange instant message and conduct pools, then terminates the conference and unregisters the two test users.
  The scheduled conference will also be deleted when the test is finished.

  The `Test-CsUcwaConference` cmdlet can also be used to determine whether or not anonymous users can join online conferences.

  Note that the `Test-CsUcwaConference` cmdlet should not be run against a Skype for Business Server pool unless UCWA has been installed on that pool.
  If UCWA has not been installed then the call to the `Test-CsUcwaConference` cmdlet will fail.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Test-CsUcwaConference` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
