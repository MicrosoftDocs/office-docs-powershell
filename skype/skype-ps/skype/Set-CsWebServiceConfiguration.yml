examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EnableGroupExpansion $True
  description: |-
    Example 1 enables group expansion for the Web Services configuration settings applied to the Redmond site (-Identity site:Redmond).
    This is done by including the EnableGroupExpansion property and setting the parameter value to True.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Filter "site:*" | Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration -MaxValidityPeriodHours 16
  description: |-
    In Example 2, the maximum validity period for all the Web Services configuration settings applied at the site scope is changed to 16 hours.
    To carry out this task, the `Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet is called along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "site:*" limits the returned data to settings where the Identity begins with the characters "site:".
    This collection is then piped to the `Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet, which takes each item in the collection and changes the MaxValidityPeriodHours property to 16.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.EnableGroupExpansion -eq $True} | Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration -MaxGroupSizeToExpand 400
  description: |-
    In Example 3, the group expansion size is set to 400 for each collection of Web Services configuration settings that allow group expansion.
    To do this, the `Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet is called without any parameters; this returns a collection of all the Web Services configuration settings used in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which selects only those settings where the EnableGroupExpansion property is equal to True.
    In turn, this filtered collection is piped to the `Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet, which takes each item in the collection and sets the value of the MaxGroupSizeToExpand property to 400.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 4
  code: |-
    Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity global -ShowDownloadCommunicatorAttendeeLink $True
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 4 shows how the global Web Services settings can be configured so that any person joining a meeting using a client application other than Skype for Business Server will first be shown a link to a site where he or she can download Skype for Business Web App.
    This is done by including the ShowDownloadCommunicatorAttendeeLink parameter and setting the parameter value to $True.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 5
  code: |-
    $x = New-CsWebOrigin -Url "https://fabrikam.com"

    Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" - CrossDomainAuthorizationList @{Add=$x}
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 5 add the domain https://fabrikam.com to an existing collection of Web service configuration settings.
    To carry out this task, the first command in the example uses the `New-CsWebOrigin` cmdlet to create a domain object for fabrikam.com.
    The resulting domain object is stored in a variable named $x.

    The second command in the example uses the `Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet to add https://fabrikam.com to the Web service configuration settings applied to the Redmond site.
    The syntax @{Add=$x} adds the domain to any domains already in the collection of domains authorized for cross-domain scripting.
    To replace the existing collection with just https://fabrikam.com use the syntax @{Replace=$x}.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 6
  code: |-
    $x = Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond"

    $x.CrossDomainAuthorizationList.RemoveAt(0)

    Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Instance $x
  description: |-
    In Example 6, the first domain listed in the collection of domains authorized for cross-domain scripting is removed from the web service configuration settings for the Redmond site.
    To carry out this task, the first command in the example uses the `Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet to return the current settings for the Redmond site.
    Those values are stored in a variable named $x.

    In the second command, the RemoveAt method is used to remove the first domain from the CrossDomainAuthorizationList property.
    Domains are stored in this property as arrays, with the first domain having an index number of 0, the second domain having an index number of 1 and so on.
    To remove the second domain (index number 1) from the CrossDomainAuthorizationList property you would use this syntax:

    `$x.CrossDomainAuthorizationList.RemoveAt(1)`

    Note that command 2 removes the domain from the copy of the Redmond site stored in the variable $x and not from the site itself.
    To actually remove the domain from the Redmond site, the third command in the example uses the `Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet and the Instance parameter to overwrite settings for the Redmond site with the settings stored in $x.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 7
  code: |-
    Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" - CrossDomainAuthorizationList $Null
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 7 modifies the web service configuration settings for the Redmond site by removing all the domains that are authorized for cross-domain scripting.
    This is done by setting the CrossDomainAuthorizationList property to a null value ($Null).

  Many Skype for Business Server components are web-based: these components either use Web Services or webpages to carry out their tasks.
  For example, users employ a web service when searching for new contacts in the Address Book or when using group expansion to view the individual members of a distribution group.
  Likewise, components ranging from dial-in conferencing to Skype for Business Server Control Panel use web pages as the interface between Skype for Business Server and users.

  The CsWebServiceConfiguration cmdlets enable administrators to manage Web Services configuration settings throughout the organization.
  This includes managing group expansion, certificate settings and allowed authentication methods.
  Because you can configure different settings at the global, site and service scope (albeit for the only the Web Services service), you can customize Web Services capabilities for different users and different locations.
  The CsWebServiceConfiguration cmdlets enable administrators to manage Web Services configuration settings throughout the organization.

  Because you can configure different settings at the global, site and service scope (Web Services service only) you can customize Web Services capabilities for different users and different locations.

  Custom settings (for example, custom validity periods for certificates) can be specified at the time you create a new Web Services configuration setting collection.
  Alternatively, you can modify the property values for an existing collection by using the `Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet.
