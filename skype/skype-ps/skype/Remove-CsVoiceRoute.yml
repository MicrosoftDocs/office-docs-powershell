    This command removes all voice routes from the organization.

  code: |-
    Get-CsVoiceRoute -Filter *Redmond* | Remove-CsVoiceRoute
  description: |-
    This command removes all voice routes with an identity that includes the string "Redmond." First the `Get-CsVoiceRoute` cmdlet is called with the Filter parameter.
    The value of the Filter parameter is the string Redmond surrounded by wildcard characters (*), which specifies that the string can be anywhere within the Identity.
    After all of the voice routes with identities that include the string Redmond are retrieved, these voice routes are piped to the `Remove-CsVoiceRoute` cmdlet, which removes each one.

description: |-
  Use this cmdlet to remove an existing voice route.
  Voice routes are associated with voice policies through PSTN usages, so removing a voice route does not change any values relating to a voice policy, it simply changes the routing for the numbers that had matched the pattern for the deleted voice route.
