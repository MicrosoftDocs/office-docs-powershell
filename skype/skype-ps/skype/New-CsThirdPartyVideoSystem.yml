    New-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem -RegistrarPool "redmond-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -OU "ou=Telecommunications,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" -DisplayName "Redmond Video System" -SipAddress "sip:redmondvideo@litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    In Example 1, a new third-party video system contact object is created in the Telecommunications OU.
    This new contact object will be homed on the Registrar pool Redmond-cs-001.litwareinc.com; will have the display name Redmond Video System and will use the SIP address sip:redmondvideo@litwareinc.com.

  code: |-
    New-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem -RegistrarPool "redmond-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -DN "cn=RedmondVideoSystem,ou=Telecommunications,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" -SipAddress "sip:redmondvideo@litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 2 creates a new third-party video system by associating that system with an existing Active Directory contact object.
    To carry out that task you need to include three parameters: RegistrarPool, which specifies the Registrar pool where the new video system account will be homed; DN, which specifies the Active Directory distinguished name of the existing contact object; and SipAddress, which assigns a SIP address to the new video system.

    Enables you to associate an existing Active Directory contact object with a third-party video system.
    If you have a contact object you want to associate with video system, use the DN parameter followed by the distinguished name of that contact.
    For example:

    `-DN "cn=Building 14 Lobby,dc=litwareinc,dc=com"`

    Note that the command will fail if the specified contact does not exist.
    Note, too that you cannot use the OU and the DN parameters in the same command.

    The line URI should be specified by using the E.164 format and be prefixed by the "TEL:" prefix.
    For example:

    `-LineURI "TEL:+14255551297"`

    Any extension number should be added to the end of the line URI; for example:

    If you include the OU parameter, a new contact will be created in the specified OU and the contact will automatically be assigned a GUID (globally unique identifier) as its common name.
    As a result, the contact object will have a name similar to this: {ce84964a-c4da-4622-ad34-c54ff3ed361f}.

  Third-party video systems are VTC devices that provide remote users with telepresence capabilities (most notably audio and video).
  In Skype for Business Server, third-party VTC devices can be configured as Active Directory contact objects, much in the same way that analog phones and common area phones can be configured as contact objects.
  Associating each VTC device with a contact object makes it easy for administrators to track and to manage, these devices.
  VTC contact objects can be created by using the `New-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem` cmdlet.
