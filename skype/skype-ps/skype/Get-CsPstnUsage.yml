  code: |-
    Get-CsPstnUsage
  description: |-
    This command returns the list of global PSTN usages available within the organization.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    (Get-CsPstnUsage).Usage
  description: |-
    The command in this example returns a list of all defined PSTN usages, with one usage listed on each line of output.
    Calling the Get-CsPstnUsage cmdlet by itself returns the Identity and the Usage list.
    If the Usage list contains more than three or four entries, the list will be abbreviated in the output, similar to this:

    Usage : {Internal, Local, Long Distance, International...}

    Use the command in this example to display only a list of usages.
    The output will be similar to this:

    Internal

    Local

    Long Distance

    International

    Restricted

- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    (Get-CsPstnUsage).Usage | ForEach-Object {if ($_ -like "*tern*") {$_}}
  description: |-
    This command returns all the PSTN usage names that have the string "tern" somewhere within the name.
    For example, this command will return "Internal" and "International" but not "Local" or "Long Distance".

    The first part of this command is the Get-CsPstnUsage cmdlet within parentheses, which means the first thing that happens is for all the PSTN usages to be retrieved.
    The .Usage property returns only the usage information for the PSTN usages, not the Identity.
    This list of usages is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which looks at the usage strings one at a time.
    The If statement compares the current usage string to the string "*tern*" (the * are wildcards) and displays any occurrence that matches that pattern.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    The Filter parameter allows you to retrieve only those PSTN usages with an Identity matching a particular wildcard string.
    However, the only Identity available to PSTN usages is Global, so this parameter is not useful for this cmdlet.
