# Get-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy

## SYNOPSIS
TeamsUpgradePolicy allows administrators to manage the transition from Skype for Business to Teams. IMPORTANT:  TeamsUpgradePolicy will replace TeamsInteropPolicy.  Aspects of TeamsUpgradePolicy are still in preview mode as described below.

## SYNTAX

### Identity (Default)
```
Get-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy [-Tenant <Guid>] [[-Identity] <XdsIdentity>] [-LocalStore] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Filter
```
Get-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy [-Tenant <Guid>] [-Filter <String>] [-LocalStore] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
TeamsUpgradePolicy allows administrators to manage the transition from Skype for Business to Teams. This cmdlet returns the set of instances of this policy. As an organization with Skype for Business starts to adopt Teams, administrators can manage client behavior for their end user using the concept of "mode", which defines where routing behavior (e.g in which client do chats and calls land). In the future, mode will also be used to define client behavior in Teams client in terms of what functionality will be available.  TeamsUpradePolicy can be granted either on a per user basis or on a tenant-wide basis.  In addition, prior to upgrading to TeamsOnly mode administrators can use TeamsUpgradePolicy to trigger notifications in the Skype for Business client to inform users of the pending upgrade. 

NOTES: 
   All relevant instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy are built into the system, so there is no corresponding New cmdlet.

   Instances with mode set to SfBWithTeamsCollab are not yet functional. From a routing perspective, this will behave like SfBOnly mode.

IMPORTANT:  TeamsUpgradePolicy will replace TeamsInteropPolicy. Components that previously honored TeamsInteropPolicy are being updated to honor TeamsUpgradePolicy instead. During the transition, use of these 2 policies must be coordinated during the transition. After transition is complete, TeamsInteorpPolicy will be removed.
