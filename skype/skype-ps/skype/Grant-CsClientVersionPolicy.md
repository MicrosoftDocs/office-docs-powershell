# Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

Assigns a client version policy at the global, site, service, or per-user scope.
Client version policies enable you to specify which clients (such as Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2) will be able to log on to your Skype for Business Server system.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy [-Identity] <UserIdParameter> [[-PolicyName] <String>] [-PassThru] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Client version policies represent a collection of client version rules; in turn, client version rules are used to determine which client applications are allowed to log on to Skype for Business Server.
When a user attempts to log on to Skype for Business Server his or her client application sends a SIP header to the server; this header includes detailed information about the application itself, including the software's major version, minor version, and build number.
The version information included in the SIP header is then checked against a collection of client version rules to see if any rules apply to that particular application.
If such a rule exists, Skype for Business Server will then take the action specified by the rule.
For example, the rule might tell Skype for Business Server to allow the logon, to block it, or to allow the logon but then silently update the client application to the latest version (for example, update Office Communicator 2007 R2 to Skype for Business).

Client version policies, which can be applied at the global scope, the site scope, the service scope (Registrar service only), or the per-user scope, give you flexibility in determining which client applications can be used to access the system.
For example, you might want to prevent users from logging on to Skype for Business Server by using Communicator 2007 R2 because this older client application does not support the same features and capabilities as Skype for Business.
However, due to hardware or software conflicts, you might also have a select group of users who cannot upgrade to Skype for Business.
In that case, you can create a separate rule -- and a separate client version policy -- that allows those users to log on from within Communicator 2007 R2.

The Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy cmdlet enables you to assign client version policies to individual users.
When you create a per-user policy, that policy is not automatically assigned to anyone; assignment does not take place until you call the Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy cmdlet to explicitly assign the policy to a user or set of users.

It's important to note that client version policies do not apply to federated users; instead, federated users are bound by the client version policies used in their own organization.
For example, suppose a federated user uses client A, a client allowed by the federated organization.
As long as the federated organization allows the use of client A, this user will be able to communicate with your organization using that client.
This will be true even if your client version policy blocks the use of client A.
Client version policies enforced in your organization do not override the client version policies used in a federated organization.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName "RedmondClientVersionPolicy"
```

In Example 1, the client version policy RedmondClientVersionPolicy is assigned to user Ken Myer.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsUser -LdapFilter "l=Redmond" | Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy -PolicyName "RedmondClientVersionPolicy"
```

The command shown in Example 2 assigns the client version policy RedmondClientVersionPolicy to all the users who work in the city of Redmond.
To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsUser cmdlet and the LdapFilter parameter to retrieve the appropriate collection of user accounts; the filter value "l=Redmond" (where "l" is the lowercase letter L, the LDAP attribute name for "locality") limits data retrieval to users who work in the city of Redmond.
This collection is then piped to the Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy cmdlet, which assigns the specified policy to each user in the collection.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsUser -OU "ou=Redmond,ou=North America,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy -PolicyName "RedmondClientVersionPolicy"
```

In Example 3, all the users in a specific organizational unit (OU) are assigned the client version policy RedmondClientVersionPolicy.
To accomplish this task, the command first calls the Get-CsUser cmdlet and the OU parameter; the parameter value represents the distinguished name of the OU in which users are to be assigned the client version policy (ou=Redmond,ou=North America,dc=litwareinc,dc=com).
After the user accounts have been retrieved, the collection is piped to the Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy cmdlet, which assigns RedmondClientVersionPolicy to each of those users.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsUser -Filter {VoicePolicy -eq "RedmondVoicePolicy"} | Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy -PolicyName "RedmondClientVersionPolicy"
```

Example 4 assigns the client version policy RedmondClientVersionPolicy to all of the users who have previously been assigned the voice policy RedmondVoicePolicy.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsUser cmdlet along with the Filter parameter; the filter value {VoicePolicy -eq "RedmondVoicePolicy"} ensures that the only user accounts returned are those where the VoicePolicy property is equal to "RedmondVoicePolicy".
The resulting user accounts are then piped to the Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy cmdlet and assigned the client version policy RedmondClientVersionPolicy.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 5 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsUser | Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy -PolicyName $Null
```

In Example 5, all the users in the organization are unassigned any per-user client version policies previously assigned to them.
To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsUser cmdlet to return a collection of all the users in the organization who have been enabled for Skype for Business Server.
This collection is then piped to the Remove-CsClientVersionPolicy cmdlet, which removes any per-user client version policies assigned to those users.
This is done by setting the parameter value of PolicyName to $null.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Indicates the Identity of the user account the policy should be assigned to.
User Identities can be specified by using one of four formats: 1) the user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (for example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).
User Identities can also be referenced by using the user's Active Directory distinguished name.

In addition, you can use the asterisk (*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
For example, the Identity "* Smith" returns all the users who have a display name that ends with the string value " Smith".

```yaml
Type: UserIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PolicyName
"Name" of the policy to be assigned.
The PolicyName is simply the policy Identity minus the policy scope ("tag:").
For example, a policy with the Identity tag:Redmond has a PolicyName equal to Redmond; a policy with the Identity tag:RedmondClientVersionPolicy has a PolicyName equal to RedmondClientVersionPolicy.
To unassign a per-user policy previously assigned to a user, set the PolicyName to a null value ($null).

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru

If present, causes the cmdlet to pass the user object (or objects) through the Windows PowerShell pipeline.
By default, the Grant-CsClientVersionPolicy cmdlet does not pass objects through the pipeline.
