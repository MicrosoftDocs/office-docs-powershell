# Invoke-CsComputerFailOver

## SYNOPSIS
Use the Invoke-CsComputerFailOver to force a computer in a Skype for Business Server pool to failover to other servers within the pool.
To successfully run this cmdlet you need to run it using an account that has administrator privileges on each server in the source and target pools.

## SYNTAX

```
Invoke-CsComputerFailOver [[-ComputerName] <String>] [-Confirm] [-Force] [-NoStop] [-Report <String>]
 [-WaitTime <TimeSpan>] [-WhatIf] [-DrainingTimeout <TimeSpan>] [-SkipFabricHealthCheck] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Invoke-CsComputerFailOver cmdlet migrates the users and data, and drains the existing conferences and sessions before the Skype for Business services are stopped and disabled to prevent accidental restart when computer is rebooted.

The Invoke-CsComputerFailOver cmdlet functionality is not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.

To return a list of all the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles a cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt.

`Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -Match "\<DesiredCmdletName\>"}`

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

Invoke-CsComputerFailOver -ComputerName "atl-mcs-001.litwareinc.com" -Report "C:\Logs\S1_FailOverLog.html" -WaitTime 1:30:00
```

This example directs that the users assigned to server "atl-mcs-001.litwareinc.com" will be moved to other servers in the pool.
The log output path is specified and the cmdlet will wait 1 hour 30 minutes before timing out.


## PARAMETERS
