# Set-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Modifies settings that provide public switched telephone network (PSTN) phone numbers to access Exchange Subscriber Access and Auto Attendant features.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Set-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration [[-Identity] <XdsIdentity>] [-AutoAttendantNumber <String>]
 [-Enabled <Boolean>] [-SubscriberAccessNumber <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Instance
```
Set-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration [-Instance <PSObject>] [-AutoAttendantNumber <String>]
 [-Enabled <Boolean>] [-SubscriberAccessNumber <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet allows you to modify settings that determine where Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access calls are rerouted to when IP connectivity to an Exchange server is lost.

Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access are features of Exchange.
The Auto Attendant feature provides voice recognition and touch-tone control (dual-tone multifrequency, or DTMF) for outside callers to navigate a company's phone system to reach the desired department or employee or, in Message Taking Mode, to accept messages for users.
(Voice rerouting for Message Taking Mode is recommended.) Subscriber Access allows internal users to access their Microsoft Outlook mailbox from a phone.
The numbers provided by these settings allow callers to leave voice mail messages for Enterprise Voice users (the AutoAttendantNumber setting) and for those users to retrieve voice mail even if the IP connectivity from the Skype for Business Server deployment at a remote site to Exchange in the data center is unavailable (the SubscriberAccessNumber setting).

Note that these settings are not available unless the Enabled property has been set to True.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1 -Enabled $True
```

This example enables the voice mail rerouting configuration settings for the site Redmond1.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Set-CsVoicemailReroutingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond1 -SubscriberAccessNumber "+14255551213"
```

This example modifies the voice mail rerouting settings that apply to the site Redmond1, setting the phone number for Subscriber Access to +14255551213.
