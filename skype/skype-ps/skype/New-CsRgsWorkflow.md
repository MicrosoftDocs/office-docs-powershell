# New-CsRgsWorkflow

## SYNOPSIS

Creates a new Response Group workflow.
Workflows determine the actions that are taken when the Response Group application receives a phone call.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

## DESCRIPTION

Workflows are a key element in the Response Group application.
Each workflow is uniquely associated with a phone number; when someone calls that number, the workflow determines how the call will be handled.
For example, the call might be routed to a series of interactive voice response (IVR) questions that prompt the caller to enter additional information ("Press 1 for hardware support.
Press 2 for software support.") Alternatively, the call might be placed in a queue and the caller placed on hold until an agent is available to answer the call.
The availability of agents to answer calls is also dictated by the workflow: workflows are used to configure business hours (the days of the week and the times of day when agents are available to answer calls) and also holidays (days when no agents are available to answer calls).

New workflows are created by using the New-CsRgsWorkflow cmdlet.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

New-CsRgsWorkflow -Parent service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -Name "Help Desk" -PrimaryUri "sip:helpdesk@litwareinc.com"
```

Example 1 creates a new workflow on the service ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This workflow is given the Name Help Desk and is assigned a primary URI of sip:helpdesk@litwareinc.com.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- 
```

$prompt = New-CsRgsPrompt -TextToSpeechPrompt "Welcome to the help desk."

$queue = (Get-CsRgsQueue -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -Name "Help Desk").Identity

$callAction = New-CsRgsCallAction -Prompt $prompt -Action TransferToQueue -QueueId $queue

New-CsRgsWorkflow -Parent service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -Name "Help Desk" -PrimaryUri "sip:helpdesk@litwareinc.com" -DefaultAction $callAction
```

The command shown in Example 2 create a new workflow prompt and call action, then assigns those items to a new Response Group workflow.
In the first command, the New-CsRgsPrompt cmdlet is used to create a text-to-speech prompt "Welcome to the help desk." This new prompt is stored in a variable named $prompt.

The second command uses the Get-CsRgsQueue cmdlet to retrieve the Identity of an existing Response Group queue named Help Desk; the returned Identity is stored in a variable named $queue.

Command 3 then creates a new call action (stored in a variable named $callAction) that references both the new prompt ($prompt) and the retrieved queue ($queue).
Finally, the last command in the example creates a new workflow named Help Desk.
This command sets the PrimaryUri to sip:helpdesk@litwareinc.com and sets the value of the DefaultAction property to the call action created in the previous step.


## PARAMETERS

### -Name
Unique name to be assigned to the workflow.
The combination of the Parent property and the Name property enables you to uniquely identify workflows without having to refer to the workflow's globally unique identifier (GUID).

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Parent
Service where the new workflow will be hosted.
For example: `-Parent "service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com".`

```yaml

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PrimaryUri
SIP address for the workflow.
For example: `-PrimaryUri "sip:helpdesk@litwareinc.com".`
The PrimaryUri must begin with the "sip:" prefix.

```

### -Active
If set to True, this means that the workflow is active and available to take phone calls.
If set to False (the default value), the workflow is not available to take phone calls.

When the Active property is set to True then the workflow will be validated before it is created.
For example, the workflow will not be created if a DefaultAction has not been specified.
If Active is set to False (or not configured) then no validation will take place, and the workflow will be created even if a DefaultAction has not been specified.

Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Language

Language that is used to read workflow text-to-speech prompts.
The language parameter is optional as long as the operating system is using one of the supported languages shown in the list below.
(Note that supported speech languages represent a subset of the languages that can be used on the operating system.)

If the operating system is not using a supported language, then the Language parameter becomes mandatory, and the parameter must specify the language code for a supported language.
If your operating system is using a non-supported language on the operating system, and you run the New-CsRgsWorkflow cmdlet without including the Language parameter, your command will fail.

For example, suppose your operating system is running under the Faroese language.
This language is supported by the Windows operating system, but not by the Response Group application.
Therefore, you must include the Language parameter and a supported language when creating a new workflow.

This is required because, if no language is specified, the workflow uses the operating system language.
However, that language can be used in a workflow only if it is a language supported by the Response Group application.

The language must be specified using one of the following language codes:

ca-ES - Catalan (Spain)

da-DK - Danish (Denmark)

de-DE - German (Germany)

en-AU - English (Australia)

en-CA - English (Canada)

en-GB - English (United Kingdom)

en-IN - English (India)

en-US - English (United States)

es-ES - Spanish (Spain)

es-MX - Spanish (Mexico)

fi-FI - Finnish (Finland)

fr-CA - French (Canada)

fr-FR - French (France)

it-IT - Italian (Italy)

ja-JP - Japanese (Japan)

ko-KR - Korean (Korea)

nb-NO - Norwegian, Bokmal (Norway)

nl-NL - Dutch (Netherlands)

pl-PL - Polish (Poland)

pt-BR - Portuguese (Brazil)

pt-PT - Portuguese (Portugal)

ru-RU - Russian (Russia)

sv-SE - Swedish (Sweden)

zh-CN - Chinese (People's Republic of China)

zh-HK - Chinese (Hong Kong SAR)

zh-TW - Chinese (Taiwan)

For example: `-Language "nl-NL".`
