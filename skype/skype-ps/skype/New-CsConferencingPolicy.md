# New-CsConferencingPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

Creates a new conferencing policy for use in your organization.
Conferencing policies determine the features and capabilities that can be used in a conference; this includes everything from whether or not the conference can include IP audio and video to the maximum number of people who can attend a meeting.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server.

## DESCRIPTION

Conferencing is an important part of Skype for Business Server: conferencing enables groups of users to come together online to view slides and video, share applications, exchange files, and otherwise communicate and collaborate.

It's important for administrators to maintain control over conferences and conference settings.
In some cases, there might be security concerns: by default, anyone, including unauthenticated users, can participate in meetings and save any of the slides or handouts distributed during those meetings.
In other cases, there might be bandwidth concerns: having a multitude of simultaneous meetings, each involving hundreds of participants and each featuring video feeds and file sharing, has the potential to cause problems with your network.
In addition, there might be occasional legal concerns.
For example, by default meeting participants are allowed to make annotations on shared content; however, these annotations are not saved when the meeting is archived.
If your organization is required to keep a record of all electronic communication, you might want to disable annotations.

Needing to manage conferencing settings is one thing; actually managing these settings is another.
In Skype for Business Server, conferences are managed by using conferencing policies.
(In previous versions of the software, these were known as meeting policies.) As noted, conferencing policies determine the features and capabilities that can be used in a conference, including everything from whether or not the conference can include IP audio and video to the maximum number of people who can attend a meeting.
Conferencing policies can be configured at the global scope; at the site scope; or at the per-user scope.
This provides administrators with enormous flexibility when it comes to deciding which capabilities will be made available to which users.

The New-CsConferencingPolicy cmdlet enables you to create new conferencing policies at either the site or the per-user scope.
You cannot create a new global policy because the global policy already exists.
However, you can modify the property values of the global policy by using the Set-CsConferencingPolicy cmdlet.

The following parameters are not applicable to Skype for Business Online: ApplicationSharingMode, AsJob, AudioBitRateKb, Description, EnableMultiViewJoin, EnableOnlineMeetingPromptForLyncResources, EnableReliableConferenceDeletion, FileTransferBitRateKb, Force, Identity, InMemory, MaxMeetingSize, MaxVideoConferenceResolution, PipelineVariable, Tenant, and TotalReceiveVideoBitRateKb.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

New-CsConferencingPolicy -Identity SalesConferencingPolicy -MaxMeetingSize 50
```

The command shown in Example 1 uses the New-CsConferencingPolicy cmdlet to create a new conferencing policy with the Identity SalesConferencingPolicy.
This policy will use all the default values for a conferencing policy except one: MaxMeetingSize; in this example, the maximum size for a meeting will be set to 50 instead of the default value of 250.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- 
```

New-CsConferencingPolicy -Identity site:Redmond -MaxMeetingSize 100 -AllowParticipantControl $False
```

In Example 2, the New-CsConferencingPolicy cmdlet is used to create a conferencing policy with the Identity site:Redmond.
In this example two different property values are configured: MaxMeetingSize is set to 100 and AllowParticipantControl is set to False.
All other policy properties will use the default values.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

Unique identifier for the conferencing policy to be created.
Conferencing policies can be created at the site or per-user scopes.
To create a site policy, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity site:Redmond.`
To create a per-user policy, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity SalesConferencingPolicy.`

### -AllowAnnotations

Indicates whether or not participants are allowed to make on-screen annotations on any content shared during the meeting; in addition, this setting determines whether or not whiteboarding is allowed in the conference.
The default value is True.

Note that annotations are not archived along with other meeting content.

This setting applies to the user who organizes the conference: if set to False, no conference created by a user affected by this policy will include annotations.
However, the user can participate in other conferences where annotations are allowed.





```yaml

### -AllowAnonymousParticipantsInMeetings

Indicates whether anonymous users are allowed to participate in the meeting.
If set to False then only authenticated users (that is, users logged on to your Active Directory Domain Services or the Active Directory of a federated partner) are allowed to attend the meeting.
The default value is True.

This setting applies to the user who organizes the conference: if set to False, no conference created by a user affected by this policy will allow anonymous participants.

### -EnableMultiViewJoin

When set to True (the default value) clients will attempt to join a conference using multiview (which allows the client to receive multiple video streams during the conference).
This parameter will be ignored if multiview is not allowed in the conference being joined.
This setting is enforced at the per-user level, and for both conferences and peer-to-peer communication sessions.
That means that some users in a session might be allowed to have multiple video streams while other users in the same conference might not.
