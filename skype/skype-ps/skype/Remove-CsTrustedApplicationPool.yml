examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Remove-CsTrustedApplicationPool -Identity TrustPool.litwareinc.com
  description: |-
    This example removes the pool with the FQDN TrustPool.litwareinc.com.
    We use the Identity parameter to specify the FQDN of the pool we want to remove.
    Because identities are unique, this command will remove, at most, one pool.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsTrustedApplicationPool | Where-Object {$_.PoolFqdn -match "trust*"} | Remove-CsTrustedApplicationPool
  description: |-
    This example removes all trusted pools where the FQDN of the pool begins with the string "trust".
    The first part of the command is a call to the `Get-CsTrustedApplicationPool` cmdlet, which retrieves a collection of all trusted application pools in your Skype for Business Server infrastructure.
    This collection is piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet.
    The `Where-Object` cmdlet checks each item in the collection to see whether the PoolFqdn matches the wildcard string trust*.
    This will result in a collection of all trusted application pools with a PoolFqdn that begins with the string trust followed by any character or characters.
    Finally, this collection is piped to the `Remove-CsTrustedApplicationPool` cmdlet, which removes every item in the collection.

description: |-
  It is recommended that the computers that are running trusted applications within a Skype for Business Server deployment be added to a separate pool that is only for trusted applications.
  However, you can add trusted application computers to an existing pool that is also used for other purposes.
  This cmdlet removes an existing trusted application pool.
  However, you cannot remove a trusted application pool that does not have a Registrar value.
  If the trusted application pool has not been assigned a Registrar, you must add a Registrar value with the `Set-CsTrustedApplicationPool` cmdlet and then remove the pool.

  Keep in mind that removing the pool also removes all computers, applications and application endpoints associated with that pool.
