examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Remove-CsUnassignedNumber -Identity UNSet1
  description: |-
    In this example, the unassigned number settings with the Identity UNSet1 are removed.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsUnassignedNumber | Where-Object {$_.AnnouncementName -match "Welcome"} | Remove-CsUnassignedNumber
  description: |-
    Example 2 removes all unassigned number settings where the name of the assigned announcement contains the string Welcome.
    The command begins with a call to the `Get-CsUnassignedNumber` cmdlet, which returns a collection of all unassigned number settings.
    This collection is then passed to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which narrows down the collection to only those unassigned number settings with an AnnouncementName that includes (-match) the string Welcome.
    Finally, the narrowed-down collection is passed to the `Remove-CsUnassignedNumber` cmdlet, which removes everything left in the collection.

  Unassigned numbers are phone numbers that have been assigned to an organization but that have not been assigned to specific users or phones.
  Skype for Business Server can be set up to route calls to appropriate destinations when an unassigned number is called.
  This cmdlet removes the settings that define that routing.
