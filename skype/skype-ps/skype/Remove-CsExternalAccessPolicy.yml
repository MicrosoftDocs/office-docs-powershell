### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Enables you to remove an existing external access policy.
  External access policies determine whether or not your users can: 1) Communicate with users who have Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) accounts with a federated organization; 2) Communicate with users who have SIP accounts with a public instant messaging (IM) provider such as Windows Live; 3) Communicate with users who are using custom applications built with [Azure Communication Services (ACS)](/azure/communication-services/concepts/teams-interop) and 4) Access Skype for Business Server over the Internet, without having to log on to your internal network.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.
module: SkypeForBusiness

    Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Policy.ExternalAccess.ExternalAccessPolicy object.
    The `Remove-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet accepts pipelined input of the external access policy object.

    None.
    Instead, the `Remove-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet does not return a value or object.
    Instead, the cmdlet deletes instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Policy.ExternalAccess.ExternalAccessPolicy object.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Remove-CsExternalAccessPolicy -Identity site:Redmond
  description: |-
    In Example 1, the external access policy with the Identity site:Redmond is deleted.
    After the policy is removed, users in the Redmond site will have their external access permissions governed by the global policy.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsExternalAccessPolicy -Filter site:* | Remove-CsExternalAccessPolicy
  description: |-
    Example 2 deletes all the external access policies that have been configured at the site scope.
    To carry out this task, the command first uses the `Get-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet and the Filter parameter to return a collection of policies configured at the site scope; the filter value "site:*" limits the returned data to external access policies that have an Identity that begins with the string value "site:".
    The filtered collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet, which deletes each policy in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsExternalAccessPolicy | Where-Object {$_.EnableFederationAccess -eq $True} | Remove-CsExternalAccessPolicy
  description: |-
    In Example 3, all the external access policies that allow federation access are deleted.
    To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet to return a collection of all the external access policies configured for use in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those policies where the EnableFederationAccess property is equal to True.
    This filtered collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet, which deletes each policy in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsExternalAccessPolicy | Where-Object {$_.EnableFederationAccess -eq $True -or $_.EnablePublicCloudAccess -eq $True} | Remove-CsExternalAccessPolicy
  description: |-
    Example 4 deletes all the external access policies that meet at least one of two criteria: federation access is allowed, public cloud access is allowed, or both are allowed.
    To carry out this task, the command first uses the `Get-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet to return a collection of all the external access policies configured for use in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which selects only those policies that meet the following criteria: either EnableFederationAccess is equal to True and/or EnablePublicCloudAccess is equal to True.
    Policies meeting one (or both) of those criteria are then piped to and removed by, the `Remove-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet.

    To delete all the policies where both EnableFederationAccess and EnablePublicCloudAccess are True use the -and operator when calling the `Where-Object` cmdlet:

    `Where-Object {$_.EnableFederationAccess -eq $True -and $_.EnablePublicCloudAccess -eq $True}`

    (Note that the global policy cannot actually be removed.
    Instead, all the properties in the global policy will be reset to their default values.) To remove a site policy, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity site:Redmond`.
    To remove a per-user policy, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity SalesAccessPolicy`.

    Note that wildcards are not allowed when specifying an Identity.

description: |-
  When you install Skype for Business Server your users are only allowed to exchange instant messages and presence information among themselves: by default, they can only communicate with other people who have SIP accounts in your Active Directory Domain Services.
  In addition, users are not allowed to access Skype for Business Server over the Internet; instead, they must be logged on to your internal network before they will be able to log on to Skype for Business Server.

  1. That might be sufficient to meet your communication needs.
  If it doesn't meet your needs you can use external access policies to extend the ability of your users to communicate and collaborate.
  External access policies can grant (or revoke) the ability of your users to do any or all of the following:

  2. Communicate with people who have SIP accounts with a federated organization.
  Note that enabling federation alone will not provide users with this capability.
  Instead, you must enable federation and then assign users an external access policy that gives them the right to communicate with federated users.

  3. (Microsoft Teams only) Communicate with users who are using custom applications built with [Azure Communication Services (ACS)](/azure/communication-services/concepts/teams-interop). This policy setting only applies if ACS federation has been enabled at the tenant level using the cmdlet [Set-CsTeamsAcsFederationConfiguration](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsacsfederationconfiguration).

  4. Communicate with people who have SIP accounts with a public instant messaging service such as Windows Live.

  Access Skype for Business Server over the Internet, without having to first log on to your internal network.
  This enables your users to use Skype for Business and log on to Skype for Business Server from an Internet café or other remote location.

  When you install Skype for Business Server, a global external access policy is automatically created for you.
  In addition to the global policy, you can use the `New-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet to create external access policies configured at the site or per-user scopes.

  The `Remove-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet enables you to delete any policies that were created by using the `New-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet; that means you can delete any policies assigned to the site scope or the per-user scope.
  You can also run the `Remove-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet against the global external access policy.
  In that case, however, the global policies will not be deleted; by design, global policies cannot be deleted.
  Instead, the properties of the global policy will simply be reset to their default values.
