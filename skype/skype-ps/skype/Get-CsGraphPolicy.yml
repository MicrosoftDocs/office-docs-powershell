    Globally unique identifier (GUID) of the tenant account whose external user communication policy are being created. For example:

    -Tenant "38aad667-af54-4397-aaa7-e94c79ec2308"

    You can return your tenant ID by running this command:

    Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID

    If you are using a remote session of Windows PowerShell and are connected only to Skype for Business Online you do not have to include the Tenant parameter. Instead, the tenant ID will automatically be filled in for you based on your connection information. The Tenant parameter is primarily for use in a hybrid deployment.

  Skype for Business Online supports a Global CsGraphPolicy that is set by default to enable Outlook content pre-load in Skype for Business Online meetings. The Global policy can't be changed by you. Use the `Get-CsGraphPolicy` cmdlet to get predefined graph policies in your organization.

  To return a list of all the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles a cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created), run the following command:

  Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -Match "Get-CsGraphPolicy"}
