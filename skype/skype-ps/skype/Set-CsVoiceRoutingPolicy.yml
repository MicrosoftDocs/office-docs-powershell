summary: |-
  Modifies an existing voice routing policy.
  Voice routing policies manage PSTN usages for users of hybrid voice.
  Hybrid voice enables users homed on Skype for Business Online to take advantage of the Enterprise Voice capabilities available in an on-premises installation of Skype for Business Server.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.
module: SkypeForBusiness

    The `Set-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy` cmdlet accepts pipelined instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Policy.Voice.VoiceRoutingPolicy object.
outputs:

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -PstnUsages @{Add="Long Distance"}
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 adds the PSTN usage "Long Distance" to the per-user voice routing policy RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -PstnUsages @{Remove="Local"}
  description: |-
    In Example 2, the PSTN usage "Local" is removed from the per-user voice routing policy RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy | Where-Object {$_.PstnUsages -contains "Local"} | Set-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -PstnUsages @{Remove="Local"}
  description: |-
    Example 3 removes the PSTN usage "Local" is removed from all the voice routing policies that include that usage.
    In order to do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy` cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the available voice routing policies.
    That collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those policies where the PstnUsages property includes (-contains) the "Local" usage.
    Those policies are then piped to the `Set-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy` cmdlet, which deletes the Local usage from each policy.

  description: |+
    Unique identifier assigned to the policy when it was created.
    Voice routing policies can be assigned at the global scope or the per-user scope.

    To refer to a per-user policy, use syntax similar to this:

    `-Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy"`

description: |-
  Voice routing policies are used in "hybrid" scenarios: when some of your users are homed on the on-premises version of Skype for Business Server and other users are homed on Skype for Business Online.
  Assigning your Skype for Business Server users a voice routing policy enables those users to receive and to place phones calls to the public switched telephone network by using your on-premises SIP trunks.

  Note that simply assigning a user a voice routing policy will not enable them to make PSTN calls via Skype for Business Online.
  Among other things, you will also need to enable those users for Enterprise Voice and will need to assign them an appropriate voice policy and dial plan.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Set-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
