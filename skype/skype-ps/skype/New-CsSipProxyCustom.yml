  Each proxy server must be associated with a realm; realms (also known as protection domains) indicate where a user's logon credentials should be processed.
  By default, Skype for Business Server uses SIP Communications Service as its default realm; however, it is possible to change the realm used by a proxy server.
  This is done by creating a SipProxy.Custom object and then assigning that object to the Realm property of the appropriate proxy server (or servers).
  You can create a custom realm by using the New-CsSipProxyCustom cmdlet.
