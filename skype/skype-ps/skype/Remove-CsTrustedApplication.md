# Remove-CsTrustedApplication

## SYNOPSIS
Removes a trusted application from the associated trusted service.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsTrustedApplication [-Identity] <ExternalApplicationIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
A trusted application is an application developed by a third party that is given trusted status to run as part of Skype for Business Server but that is not a built-in part of the product.
This cmdlet removes a trusted application from a trusted application pool.
Note that the application itself is not deleted, only the association with the trusted application pool and the trusted service is removed.

When you use this cmdlet to remove a trusted application, you must supply a value for the Identity parameter.
The Identity is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the pool on which the application is homed followed by a slash (/) followed by the application ID.
For example, TrustPool.litwareinc.com/tapp2, where TrustPool.litwareinc.com is the pool FQDN and tapp2 is the application ID.
Note that if you view an existing application by calling the `Get-CsTrustedApplication` cmdlet you'll see an ID that looks more like this: TrustPool.litwareinc.com/urn:application:tapp2.
Notice the prefix urn:application: before the application name (tapp2).
While this prefix is part of the Identity, it's not required when you specify the value for the Identity parameter.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Remove-CsTrustedApplication -Identity TrustPool.litwareinc.com/tapp2
```

This example removes the trusted application with the Identity TrustPool.litwareinc.com/tapp2 from the associated trusted service.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Get-CsTrustedApplication -Filter *trust* | Remove-CsTrustedApplication
```

Example 2 removes all trusted applications that have identities that include the string "trust".
The command begins with a call to the `Get-CsTrustedApplication` cmdlet, passing a Filter value of *trust*.
This command will retrieve all trusted applications with the string trust anywhere within the Identity.
The collection of trusted applications that is retrieved is then piped to the `Remove-CsTrustedApplication` cmdlet, which removes each one as a trusted application.
(Note that the application itself is not deleted; only the association with the trusted application pool and the trusted service is removed.)
