# Remove-CsRoutingConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Resets the routing configuration to its default settings.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsRoutingConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Voice routes contain instructions that tell Skype for Business Server how to route calls from Enterprise Voice users to phone numbers on the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or a private branch exchange (PBX).
This cmdlet removes the global (and only) routing configuration, which is a container for all voice routes defined for a Skype for Business Server deployment.
"Removing" the routing configuration doesn't actually remove it; the Global (and only) instance is still there.
However, it does set the list of voice routes to the default settings.

WARNING: Removing the routing configuration (in other words, setting the list of voice routes to the default) deletes all defined voice routes for a Skype for Business Server deployment and replaces them with a single route with default settings.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Remove-CsRoutingConfiguration -Identity Global -Confirm
```

This example resets the Global (and only) routing configuration to the default settings.
This action deletes all defined voice routes, so we added the Confirm parameter in order to receive a prompt asking whether we really want to perform this action before the removal takes place.
