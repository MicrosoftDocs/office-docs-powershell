# New-CsSimpleUrlConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS

Creates a new simple URL configuration collection.
Simple URLs make it easier for users to join meetings and conferences.
They also make it easier for Administrators to sign in to the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
New-CsSimpleUrlConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-SimpleUrl <PSListModifier>] [-InMemory] [-Force]
 [-Tenant <Guid>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

In Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2, meetings had URLs similar to this:

https://imdf.litwareinc.com/Join?uri=sip%3Akenmyer%40litwareinc.com%3Bgruu%3Bopaque%3Dapp%3Aconf%3Afocus%3Aid%3A125f95a0b0184dcea706f1a0191202a8&key=EcznhLh5K5t

However, such URLs are not especially intuitive, and not easy to convey to someone else.
The simple URLs introduced in Lync Server 2010 help overcome those problems by providing users with URLs that look more like this:

https://meet.litwareinc.com/kenmyer/071200

Simple URLs are an improvement over the URLs used in Office Communications Server.
However, simple URLs are not automatically created for you; instead, you must configure the URLs yourself.
In addition, you must also do such things as create Domain Name System (DNS) records for each URL; configure reverse proxy rules for external access; add the simple URLs to the your Front End Server certificates; and so on.

Skype for Business Server enables you to create three different simple URLs:

Meet - Used for meetings.
You must have at least one Meet URL for each of your SIP domains.

Admin - Used to point administrators toward the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.

Dialin - Used for the dial-in conferencing webpage.

Simple URLs are stored in simple URL configuration collections.
When you install Skype for Business Server, a global collection is created for you; you can also create custom collections at the site scope.
This gives you the ability to use different simple URLs at each of your sites.

Simple URL configuration collections are created by using the New-CsSimpleUrlConfiguration cmdlet; you can then use additional cmdlets (such as the New-CsSimpleUrl cmdlet and the Set-CsSimpleUrlConfiguration cmdlet) to populate these collections with simple URLs.
After updating a simple URL collection you must then run the Enable-CsComputer cmdlet.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

New-CsSimpleUrlConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond"
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new simple URL collection for the Redmond site.
Because no parameters other than Identity are included with this command, the new collection will not contain any simple URLs.
This command will fail if the Redmond site already hosts a simple URL collection.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- 
```

$urlEntry = New-CsSimpleUrlEntry -Url "https://dialin.fabrikam.com"

$simpleUrl = New-CsSimpleUrl -Component "dialin" -Domain "*" -SimpleUrlEntry $urlEntry -ActiveUrl "https://dialin.fabrikam.com"

$urlEntry2 = New-CsSimpleUrlEntry -Url "https://meet.fabrikam.com"

$simpleUrl2 = New-CsSimpleUrl -Component "meet" -Domain "fabrikam.com" -SimpleUrlEntry $urlEntry2

New-CsSimpleUrlConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" -SimpleUrl @{Add=$simpleUrl,$simpleUrl2}
```

Example 2 shows how you can create a new collection of simple URLs that includes two simple URLs (one for meeting management and one for dial-in conferencing).
To do this, the first command in the example uses the New-CsSimpleUrlEntry cmdlet to create a URL entry that points to https://dialin.litwareinc.com; this URL entry is stored in a variable named $urlEntry.
The second command then creates another URL entry, this one pointing to https://meet.fabrikam.com.

Next, the New-CsSimpleUrl cmdlet is used to create an in-memory-only instance of a simple URL.
In this example, the URL Component is set to dialin; the domain is set to an asterisk (*); the ActiveUrl is set to https://dialin.fabrikam.com; and the SimpleUrl property is set to $urlEntry.
(The variable $urlEntry represents the URL entry created in the first command.) A similar command is then used to create a simple URL for meet.fabrikam.com.

After the URLs have been created (and stored in the object references $simpleUrl and $simpleUrl2) the final command in the example creates a new simple URL collection for the Redmond site, adding the two new in-memory-only URLs to that collection.
The new URLs are added to the collection by using the New-CsSimpleUrlConfiguration cmdlet, the SimpleUrl parameter, and the parameter value @{Add=$simpleUrl, $simpleUrl2}.
That syntax causes the URLs stored in the object references $simpleUrl and $simpleUrl2 to be added to the SimpleUrl property.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

Unique identifier for the new simple URL configuration collection.
Because new collections can only be created at the site scope, the Identity must be the prefix "site:" followed by the name of the site.
For example, this syntax creates a new collection for the Redmond site:

`-Identity "site:Redmond"`



```yaml
Type: XdsIdentity
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SimpleUrl

Simple URLs that have been configured for this collection.
These URLs must be created by using the New-SimpleUrl cmdlet and the New-SimpleUrlEntry cmdlet.



```yaml
Type: PSListModifier
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

```

### -InMemory

Creates an object reference without actually committing the object as a permanent change.
If you assign the output of this cmdlet called with this parameter to a variable, you can make changes to the properties of the object reference and then commit those changes by calling this cmdlet's matching Set-\<cmdlet\>.



```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

```

### -Force
Suppresses the display of any non-fatal error message that might occur when running the command.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter

Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

```

### -Tenant

Globally unique identifier (GUID) of the Skype for Business Online tenant account for which the new Simple URL configuration settings are being created.
For example:

`-Tenant "38aad667-af54-4397-aaa7-e94c79ec2308"`

You can return the tenant ID for each of your tenants by running this command:

`Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID`



```yaml
Type: Guid
