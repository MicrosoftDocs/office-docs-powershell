    Test-CsASConference -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 verifies that an Application Sharing conference can be conducted on the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
    This command assumes that you have configured a pair of test users for the specified pool.
    If no such test users exist, the command will fail.

    Test-CsASConference -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -TestJoinLauncher
  description: |-
    Example 2 tests the ability of the Join Launcher service to participate in an Application Sharing conference on the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
    Note that this command tests only the service itself; you do not need any mobile devices in order to run the command.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $cred1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"

    $cred2 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

    Test-CsASConference -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -SenderSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $cred1 -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -ReceiverCredential $cred2
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 test the ability of a pair of users (litwareinc\pilar and litwareinc\kenmyer) to log on to Skype for Business Server and then conduct an Application Sharing conference.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell command-line interface credential object containing the name and password of the user Pilar Ackerman.
    (Because the logon name, litwareinc\pilar, has been included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box only requires the administrator to enter the password for the Pilar Ackerman account.) The resulting credential object is then stored in a variable named $cred1.
    The second command does the same thing, this time returning a credential object for the Ken Myer account.

    With the credential objects in hand, the third command determines whether or not these two users can log on to Skype for Business Server and conduct an Application Sharing conference.
    To carry out this task, the `Test-CsASConference` cmdlet is called, along with the following parameters: TargetFqdn (the FQDN of the Registrar pool); SenderSipAddress (the SIP address for the first test user); SenderCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for this same user); ReceiverSipAddress (the SIP address for the other test user) and ReceiverCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for the other test user).

    When present, detailed output from running the cmdlet will be stored in the specified variable.
    This variable includes a pair of methods - ToHTML and ToXML - that can then be used to save that output to either an HTML or an XML file.

    To store output in a logger variable named $TestOutput use the following syntax:

    `-OutLoggerVariable TestOutput`

    Note: Do not prepend a $ character when specifying the variable name.

    To save the information stored in the logger variable to an HTML file, use a command similar to this:

    `$TestOutput.ToHTML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.html`

    To save the information stored in the logger variable to an XML file, use a command similar to this:

    `$TestOutput.ToXML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.xml`

description: |-
  The `Test-CsASConference` cmdlet verifies that a pair of test users can participate in an online conference that includes application sharing.
  To do this, the cmdlet registers the two users with Skype for Business Server and then it uses one of the user accounts to create a new conference that includes applications sharing.
  The cmdlet then verifies that the second user is able to join that conference.

  Note that this command will fail if the test users have been assigned a conferencing policy that prevents them from using application sharing.

  Skype for Business Server: The functions carried out by the `Test-CsASConference` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server.
