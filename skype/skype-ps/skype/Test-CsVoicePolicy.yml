### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Tests a telephone number against a voice policy and determines which voice route would be used against that policy for that number.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.
module: SkypeForBusiness

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsVoicePolicy -Identity site:Redmond | Test-CsVoicePolicy -TargetNumber "+14255559999"
  description: |-
    This example runs a voice policy test against the voice policy with the Identity site:Redmond.
    First the `Get-CsVoicePolicy` cmdlet is run to retrieve the policy with the Identity site:Redmond.
    That policy object is then piped to the `Test-CsVoicePolicy` cmdlet, where the policy is tested against the telephone number +14255559999.
    The output will be the first voice route (based on the Priority property of the route) that has a number pattern matching the TargetNumber value and a phone usage matching a phone usage in the policy.
    If no matching route is found (for example, if the number pattern matches the pattern for an 11-digit number and you supply a 7-digit number) a null value will be returned.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $a = Get-CsVoicePolicy -Identity site:Redmond

    Test-CsVoicePolicy -TargetNumber "+14255559999" -VoicePolicy $a
  description: |-
    Example 2 is identical to Example 1 except that instead of piping the results of the Get operation directly to the `Test-CsVoicePolicy` cmdlet, the object is first stored in the variable $a and then is passed as the value to the parameter VoicePolicy to be used as the policy against which the test will run.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsVoicePolicy | Test-CsVoicePolicy -TargetNumber "+12065559999"
  description: |-
    This example runs a voice policy test against all voice policies defined within the Skype for Business Server deployment.
    First the `Get-CsVoicePolicy` cmdlet is run (with no parameters) to retrieve all the voice policies.
    The collection of policies that is returned is then piped to the `Test-CsVoicePolicy` cmdlet, where each policy in the collection is checked for a matching route based on the target phone number provided (+12065559999) and phone usages.
    The output will be a list of matching routes along with the phone usages that were matched.

  Voice policies are tied to voice routes through public switched telephone network (PSTN) usages.
  A call from a user who has been assigned a particular voice policy can only be sent through a route that has a PSTN usage matching a usage on the policy and also a number pattern that matches the number dialed.
  Call the `Test-CsVoicePolicy` cmdlet to determine which (if any) route will be used to route a call from a user with a particular voice policy, and also what phone usage ties the policy to the route.
