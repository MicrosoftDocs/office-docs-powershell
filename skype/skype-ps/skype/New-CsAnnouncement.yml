  Creates a new Skype for Business Server announcement.
  Announcements are played when users dial a valid but unassigned phone number.
  An announcement can be a message (such as "This number is temporarily out of service") or a busy signal.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsAnnouncement -Identity ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com -Name "Help Desk Announcement" -TextToSpeechPrompt "Welcome to the Help Desk." -Language "en-US"
  description: |-
    Example 1 demonstrates how you can create a new announcement that will play a TTS prompt in U.S.
    English.
    The first parameter we specify is Identity.
    The Identity must be at the service scope, followed by the service ID of the Application Server (ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com).
    Next we give the announcement a Name, in this case Help Desk Announcement.
    To assign a TTS prompt to this announcement we use the TextToSpeechPrompt parameter followed by a string with the announcement text.
    When a TTS prompt is used for an announcement you must specify a language, which we do here by including the Language parameter followed by a string representing U.S.
    English (en-US).

    Note that announcement identities are composed of two parts: the service where the announcement is to be stored, and a 36-character GUID (globally unique identifier).
    You will see the full Identity after you create the new announcement; the GUID is generated and applied automatically.
    That Identity will be similar to this: service:ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com/1951f734-c80f-4fb2-965d-51807c792b90.

- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsAnnouncement -Identity ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com -Name "Welcome Announcement" -AudioFilePrompt "WelcomeMessage.wav"
  description: |-
    Example 2 is similar to Example 1 in that we begin by entering the required parameters, Identity and Name.
    In this example, however, instead of a TTS prompt, we want the announcement to play an audio file.
    To do that we include the AudioFilePrompt parameter and pass it a string containing the name of the audio file (WelcomeMessage.wav).
    This file must be in the File Store in order for this announcement to play.
    You can add audio files to the File Store by calling the Import-CsAnnouncementFile cmdlet.

- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsAnnouncement -Identity ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com -Name "Forward Announcement" -AudioFilePrompt "WelcomeMessage.wav" -TargetUri sip:kmyer@litwareinc.com
  description: |-
    Like Example 2, this example creates an announcement that plays an audio file when the number is reached.
    However, in this example in addition to the Identity, Name, and AudioFilePrompt parameters, we also specify the TargetUri parameter.
    We pass this parameter the SIP URI of the user or phone to which the caller will be forwarded after the announcement has been played.

- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsAnnouncement -Identity ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com -Name "Forward Announcement" -AudioFilePrompt "WelcomeMessage.wav" -TargetUri "sip:+14255551212@litwareinc.com;user=phone"
  description: |-
    Example 4 is identical to Example 3 except that instead of forwarding the call based on a user's SIP address, the call is forwarded to a phone number.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 5 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsAnnouncement -Identity ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com -Name "Busy"
  description: |-
    In this example we don't specify a prompt or a target URI, we include only an Identity and a Name.
    That means the caller will hear a busy signal when a call to an unassigned number associated with this announcement is connected.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AudioFilePrompt

    The name of the audio file to be played for the announcement.
    Audio files are stored in the File Store.
    To save an audio file to the File Store, use the Import-CsAnnouncementFile cmdlet.

    Valid file types: WAV and WMA

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    A unique identifier for the Announcement.
    For this value you must enter the Identity of the Application Server running the Response Group application.
    For example, ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com.

    More than one Announcement can be assigned to a single service.
    Thus, in order to make the Identity a unique value, a globally unique identifier (GUID) will be automatically generated and assigned to the Identity when you create the Announcement.
    The new Announcement will have an Identity in the format service:\<service ID\>/\<GUID\>.
    For example: service: ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com/bef5fa3b-3c97-4af0-abe7-611deee7616c.
    You do not need to supply a GUID when you call this cmdlet.
    Instead, supply the service Identity, and the GUID will be auto-generated and added to the Identity.

    Although you don't have to supply a GUID, you can.
    You might want to do this if an announcement was assigned to an unassigned number range, and then the announcement was deleted.
    You can create a new announcement with a matching Identity (including the GUID) and in that case not have to update the unassigned number range.

description: |-
  An organization can own phone numbers that are not assigned to users or phones, but that are still valid numbers that can be called.
  By default when someone dials one of those numbers, that person will receive a busy signal and the call may result in an error returned to the SIP client.
  By applying announcement settings to unassigned numbers, administrators have the option of playing a message, returning a busy signal, or redirecting the call.
  This cmdlet creates these announcement settings.

  You can assign announcements to unassigned numbers by calling the New-CsUnassignedNumber or the Set-CsUnassignedNumber cmdlet.
