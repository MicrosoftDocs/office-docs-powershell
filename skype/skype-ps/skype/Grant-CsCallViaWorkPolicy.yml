    Specifies a unique identifier of the user account the policy should be assigned to.
    User identities can be specified by using one of four formats.

    SIP address

    User Principal Name (UPN)

    Domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon

    Active Directory display name (Ken Myer), or distinguished name

    In addition, you can use the asterisk (\*) wildcard character when using the display name as the user Identity.
    For example, the Identity "\* Smith" grants the policy all users who have a display name that ends in the string value " Smith".

  description: |+

    A policy with the identity "Tag:RedmondCalloutPolicy" has a PolicyName of "RedmondCalloutPolicy".
    If you set PolicyName to a null value, then the command will unassign any individual policy assigned to the user.
