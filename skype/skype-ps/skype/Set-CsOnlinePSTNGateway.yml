examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsOnlinePSTNGateway -Identity sbc.contoso.com -Enabled $true
  description: |-
    This example enables previously created SBC with Identity (and FQDN) sbc.contoso.com. All others parameters will stay default.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsOnlinePSTNGateway -Identity sbc.contoso.com -SIPSignalingPort 5064 -ForwardPAI $true -Enabled $true
  description: |-
    This example modifies the configuration of an SBC with identity (and FQDN)  sbc.contoso.com. It changes the SIPSignalingPort to 5064 and enabled P-Asserted-Identity field on outbound connections (outbound from Direct Routing to SBC). For each outbound to SBC session, the Direct Routing interface will report in P-Asserted-Identity fields the TEL URI and SIP address of the user who made a call. This is useful when a tenant administrator set identity of the caller as "Anonymous" or a general number of the company, but for the billing purposes the real identity of the user should be reported.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BypassMode
  description: |+
    Possible values are "None", "Always" and "OnlyForLocalUsers". By setting "Always" mode you indicate that your network is fully routable. If a user usually in site "Seattle", travels to site "Tallinn" and tries to use SBC located in Seattle we will try to deliver the traffic to Seattle assuming that there is connection between Tallinn and Seattle offices. With "OnlyForLocaUsers" you indicate that there is no direct connection between sites. In example above, the traffic will not be send directly from Tallinn to Seattle.

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    Used to enable this SBC for outbound calls. Can be used to temporarily remove the SBC from service while it is being updated or during maintenance. Note if the parameter is not set the SBC will be created as disabled (default value -Enabled $false).

  defaultValue: $false

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FailoverResponseCodes
  description: |+
    If Direct Routing receives any 4xx or 6xx SIP error code in response on outgoing Invite (outgoing means call from a Teams client to PSTN with traffic flow :Teams Client ->
    Direct Routing -> SBC -> Telephony network) the call is considered completed by default.
    Setting the SIP codes in this parameter forces Direct Routing on receiving the specified codes try another SBC (if another SBC exists in the voice routing policy of the user).
    Please find more in "Reference" section of "Phone System Direct Routing" documentation

    Setting this parameter overwrites the default values, so if you want to include the default values, please add them to string.

  defaultValue: 408, 503, 504

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FailoverTimeSeconds
  description: |+
    When set to 10 (default value), outbound calls that are not answered by the gateway within 10 seconds are routed to the next available trunk; if there are no additional trunks, then the call is automatically dropped. In an organization with slow networks and slow gateway responses, that could potentially result in calls being dropped unnecessarily. The default value is 10.

  name: ForwardCallHistory
  description: |+
    Indicates whether call history information will be forwarded through the trunk. If enabled, the Office 365 PSTN Proxy sends two headers: History-info and Referred-By. The default value is False ($False).

  name: ForwardPai
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the P-Asserted-Identity (PAI) header will be forwarded along with the call. The PAI header provides a way to verify the identity of the caller. The default value is False ($False). Setting this parameter to $true will render the from header anonymous, in accordance of RFC5379 and RFC3325.

  name: GatewayLbrEnabledUserOverride
  description: |+
    Allows an LBR enabled user working from a network site outside the corporate network or a network site on the corporate network not configured using a tenant network site to make outbound PSTN calls or receive inbound PSTN calls via an LBR enabled gateway. The default value is False.

  name: GatewaySiteLbrEnabled
  description: |+
    Used to enable this SBC to report assigned site location. Site location is used for Location Based Routing. When this parameter is turned on, the SBC will report the site name as defined by tenant administrator. On incoming call to a Teams user the value of the site assigned to the SBC is compared with the value of the site assigned to the user to make a routing decision. The parameter is mandatory for enabling Location Based Routing feature. The default value is False ($False).

    Used by the alerting system. When any value is set, the alerting system will generate an alert to the tenant administrator when the number of concurrent session is 90% or higher than this value. If this parameter is not set, the alerts are not generated. However, the monitoring system will report the number of concurrent sessions every 24 hours.

  name: MediaRelayRoutingLocationOverride
  description: |+
    Allows selecting path for media manually. Direct Routing assigns a datacenter for media path based on the public IP of the SBC. We always select closest to the SBC datacenter. However, in some cases a public IP from for example a US range can be assigned to an SBC located in Europe. In this case we will be using not optimal media path. We only recommend setting this parameter if the call logs clearly indicate that automatic assignment of the datacenter for media path does not assign the closest to the SBC datacenter.

  Use this cmdlet to modify the configuration of the previously created Session Border Controller (SBC) configuration. Each configuration contains specific settings for an SBC. These settings configure such entities as SIP signaling port, whether media bypass is enabled on this SBC, will the SBC send SIP options, specify the limit of maximum concurrent sessions, The cmdlet also let drain the SBC by setting parameter -Enabled to true or false state. When the Enabled parameter set to $false, the SBC will continue existing calls, but all new calls routed to another SBC in a route (if exists).
