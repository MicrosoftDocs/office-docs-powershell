# New-CsPersistentChatConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS

Creates a new collection of Persistent Chat configuration settings at the site or service scope.
Persistent Chat configuration settings are used to manage the Persistent Chat service.
For example, these settings allow you to specify the maximum number of users who can participate in a chat room.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.



## SYNTAX

```
New-CsPersistentChatConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Confirm] [-DefaultChatHistory <Int16>] [-Force]
 [-InMemory] [-MaxFileSizeKB <UInt32>] [-ParticipantUpdateLimit <UInt32>] [-RoomManagementUrl <String>]
 [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

The Persistent Chat service is managed, in part, by Persistent Chat configuration settings, which dictate such things as the number of previously-posted chat messages immediately available when you log on to a chat room (the chat history) or the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded to (or downloaded from) the service.
These settings can be configured at the global or the site scope, or at the service scope (that is, you can have a custom collection of settings assigned to an individual Persistent Chat pool).

Skype for Business Server Control Panel: To create a new collection of Persistent Chat configuration settings using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click Persistent Chat, click Persistent Chat Configuration, click New, and then click either Site configuration or Pool configuration.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- 
```

New-CsPersistentChatConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" -ParticipantUpdateLimit 100
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new set of Persistent Chat configuration settings applied to the Redmond site.
In this example, the ParticipantUpdateLimit property is set to 100.
