### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Modifies an existing device in the collection of analog devices that can be managed by using Skype for Business Server.
  An analog device is a telephone or other device that is connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.
module: SkypeForBusiness
notes: ""
inputs:
- name: <xref href=" " data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    Microsoft.Rtc.Management.ADConnect.Schema.OCSADAnalogDeviceContact object.
    The `Set-CsAnalogDevice` cmdlet accepts pipelined instances of the analog device object.
outputs:
- name: <xref href=" " data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    By default, the `Set-CsAnalogDevice` cmdlet does not return any objects or values.
    However, if you include the PassThru parameter, the cmdlet will return instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.ADConnect.Schema.OCSADAnalogDeviceContact object.

    Example 1 changes the value of the LineUri property for the analog device that has the Identity CN={ce84964a-c4da-4622-ad34-c54ff3ed361f},OU=Redmond,DC=Litwareinc,DC=com.

  code: |-
    Get-CsAnalogDevice -Filter {Gateway -eq "192.168.0.240"} | Set-CsAnalogDevice -Gateway "192.168.1.100"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 2 changes the gateway for each analog device currently using the gateway 192.168.0.240.
    To perform this task, the `Get-CsAnalogDevice` cmdlet is called along with the Filter parameter; the filter value {Gateway -eq "192.168.0.240"} ensures that only devices with a Gateway equal to (-eq) 192.168.0.240 are returned.
    This filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsAnalogDevice` cmdlet, which takes each item in the collection and changes the value of the Gateway property to 192.168.1.100.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Unique identifier for the analog device being modified.
    Analog devices are identified by using the Active Directory distinguished name (DN) of the associated contact object.
    By default, analog devices use a GUID (globally unique identifier) as their common name, which means devices will typically have an Identity similar to this: CN={ce84964a-c4da-4622-ad34-c54ff3ed361f},OU=Redmond,DC=Litwareinc,DC=com.
    This means you might find it easier to modify analog devices by using the `Get-CsAnalogDevice` cmdlet to return the analog devices objects and then piping those objects to the `Set-CsAnalogDevice` cmdlet.

name: Set-CsAnalogDevice
description: |-
  Analog devices include telephones, fax machines, modems and teletype/telecommunication device for the deaf (TTY/TDD) devices that are connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
  Unlike devices that take advantage of Enterprise Voice (that is, the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) solution offered by Microsoft), analog devices do not transmit information by using digital packets.
  Instead, information is transmitted by using a continuous signal.
  This signal is commonly referred to as an analog signal; hence the term "analog devices."

  In order to enable administrators to manage analog devices, Skype for Business Server lets you associate analog devices with Active Directory contact objects.
  After a device has been associated with a contact object, you can then manage the analog device by assigning policies and dial plans to the contact.

  The `Set-CsAnalogDevice` cmdlet provides a way for you to modify the properties of the contact objects associated with analog devices.
  For example, you can change the contact's Active Directory display name or the line Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) associated with the device.
