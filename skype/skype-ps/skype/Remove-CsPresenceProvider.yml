- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'

  code: |-
    Get-CsPresenceProvider | Remove-CsPresenceProvider
  description: |-
    In Example 2, all the presence providers configured for use in the organization are removed.
    To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsPresenceProvider` cmdlet without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the configured presence providers.
    That collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsPresenceProvider` cmdlet, which deletes each item (that is, each provider) in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsPresenceProvider | Where-Object {$_.Fqdn -match "fabrikam.com"} | Remove-CsPresenceProvider
  description: |-
    Example 3 shows how you can delete all the presence providers that have an Fqdn that includes the string value "fabrikam.com".
    To carry out this task, the command first uses the `Get-CsPresenceProvider` cmdlet to return a collection of all the available presence providers.
    That collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those providers where the Fqdn property includes (-match) the string value "fabrikam.com".
    In turn, that filtered collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsPresenceProvider` cmdlet, which deletes each provider in the filtered collection.

  That collection is stored in the PresenceProviders property.

  The `Remove-CsPresenceProvider` cmdlet enables you to remove a presence provider from the PresenceProviders property of one or more collections of User Services configuration settings.
