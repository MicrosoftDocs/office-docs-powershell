# Set-CsClientPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Modifies the property values of an existing client policy.
Among other things, client policies help determine the features of Skype for Business that are available to users; for example, you might give some users the right to transfer files while denying this right to other users.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

## DESCRIPTION
Client policies are applied each time a user accesses the system, regardless of where the user logs on from and regardless of the type of device the user logs on with.
In addition, client policies, like other Skype for Business Server policies, can readily be targeted toward selected groups of users.
You can even create a custom policy that gets assigned to a single user.

Client policies can be configured at the global, site and per-user scopes.
The `Set-CsClientPolicy` cmdlet enables you to modify any (or all) of the client policies that have been configured for use in your organization.

Keep in mind that client policies differ from many other policies in that most of the policy settings do not have default values.

The following parameters are not applicable to Skype for Business Online: AddressBookAvailability, AsJob, AttendantSafeTransfer, AutoDiscoveryRetryInterval, BlockConversationFromFederatedContacts, CalendarStatePublicationInterval, ConferenceIMIdleTimeout, CustomizedHelpUrl, CustomLinkInErrorMessages, CustomStateUrl, Description, DGRefreshInterval, DisableContactCardOrganizationTab, DisableFederatedPromptDisplayName, DisableFeedsTab, DisableMeetingSubjectAndLocation, DisableOneNote12Integration, DisableOnlineContextualSearch, DisablePhonePresence, DisablePICPromptDisplayName, EnableEventLogging, EnableExchangeContactsFolder, EnableExchangeDelegateSync, EnableFullScreenVideo, EnableHighPerformanceConferencingAppSharing, EnableHighPerformanceP2PAppSharing, EnableMediaRedirection, EnableMeetingEngagement, EnableNotificationForNewSubscribers, EnableOnlineFeedback, EnableOnlineFeedbackScreenshots, EnableSQMData, EnableTracing, EnableViewBasedSubscriptionMode, EnableVOIPCallDefault, Force, HelpEnvironment, Identity, IMLatencyErrorThreshold, IMLatencySpinnerDelay, Instance, MAPIPollInterval, MaximumDGsAllowedInContactList, MaximumNumberOfContacts, MaxPhotoSizeKB, P2PAppSharingEncryption, PipelineVariable, PolicyEntry, PublicationBatchDelay, RateMyCallAllowCustomUserFeedback, RequireContentPin, SearchPrefixFlags, SPSearchCenterExternalURL, SPSearchCenterInternalURL, SPSearchExternalURL, SPSearchInternalURL, SupportModernFilePicker, TabURL, TelemetryTier, Tenant, and WebServicePollInterval

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsClientPolicy -Identity RedmondClientPolicy -WebServicePollInterval "00:15:00"
```

The command shown in Example 1 modifies the client policy RedmondClientPolicy.
In this example, the WebServicePollInterval property is set to 15 minutes (00 hours: 15 minutes: 00 seconds).


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Set-CsClientPolicy -Identity RedmondClientPolicy -DisableEmoticons $True -DisableHtmlIm $True -DisableRTFIm $True
```

In Example 2, three different property values are modified for the client policy RedmondClientPolicy: the properties DisableEmoticons, DisableHtmlIm, and DisableRTFIm are all set to True.


### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsClientPolicy -Filter "*site:*" | Set-CsClientPolicy -DisableEmoticons $True -DisableHtmlIm $True -DisableRTFIm $True
```

Example 3 also modifies the properties DisableEmoticons, DisableHtmlIm and DisableRTFIm.
In this example, however, the modifications are made to all the client policies that have been configured at the site scope.
To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsClientPolicy` cmdlet and the Filter property to return all the client policies where the Identity begins with the characters "site:"; by definition, those are policies configured at the site scope.
This filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsClientPolicy` cmdlet, which takes each policy in the collection and modifies the values of DisableEmoticons, DisableHtmlIm and DisableRTFIm.


### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```
Get-CsClientPolicy | Where-Object {$_.MaxPhotoSizeKb -gt 10} | Set-CsClientPolicy -MaxPhotoSizeKb 10
```

In Example 4, all the client policies that allow for photos larger than 10 kilobytes are modified; after the modifications these policies will have a maximum photo size of 10 KB.
To carry out this task, the `Get-CsClientPolicy` cmdlet is first called without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the client policies configured for use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those policies where the MaxPhotoSizeKb property is greater than (-gt) 10 KB.
The filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsClientPolicy` cmdlet, which sets the value of the MaxPhotoSizeKb property for each policy in the collection to 10 KB.


## PARAMETERS

```

### -DisableEmailComparisonCheck
When set to True, Skype for Business will not attempt to verify that any currently running instance of Outlook belongs to the same user running Skype for Business; for example, the software will not verify that both Outlook and Skype for Business are running under Ken Myer's user account.
Instead, it will be assumed that the two applications are running under the same account and, in turn, will include contact and calendar data in Outlook with Skype for Business.

When set to False, Skype for Business will use SMTP addresses to verify that Outlook and Skype for Business are running under the same account.
If the SMTP addresses do not match then contact and calendar data in Outlook will not be incorporated into Skype for Business.

```

### -DisableFederatedPromptDisplayName
When set to True, any notification dialog generated when you are added to a federated user's Contacts list will use the federated user's SIP address (for example, sip:kenmyer@fabrikam.com).
When set to False, the notification dialog will use the federated user's display name (for example, Ken Myer) instead.


```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Online, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Online, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisableHandsetOnLockedMachine
When set to True, users will not be able to use their Polycom handset if the computer that the handset is connected to is locked.
To use the handset, users will first have to unlock the computer.

When set to False, users will be allowed to use their handset even if the computer the handset is connected to is locked.


```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Online, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisableHtmlIm
When set to True, any HTML text copied from a webpage will be converted to plain text when pasted into an instant message.
When set to False, HTML formatting (such as font size and color, drop-down lists and buttons, etc.) will be retained when pasted into an instant message.

Note that, even when set to False, scripts and other potentially malicious items (such as tags that play a sound) will not be copied into an instant message.
You can copy and paste buttons and other controls into a message, but any scripts attached to those controls will automatically be removed.

This setting is equivalent to the Office Communications Server 2007 R2 Group Policy setting "Prevent HTML text in instant messages."


```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Online, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisableICE
When set to True, Lync 2010 will not use the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol to traverse firewalls and network address translation (NAT) devices; this effectively prevents users from making Lync 2010 calls across the Internet.
When set to False, Lync 2010 will use the ICE protocol to enable Lync 2010 calls to traverse firewalls and (NAT) devices.

This setting is equivalent to the Office Communications Server 2007 R2 Group Policy setting "Disable Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)."

### -DisableOnlineContextualSearch
When set to True, disables the Find Previous Conversations menu option that appears when you right-click a user in your Contacts list.
(This option enables you to search the Outlook Conversation History folder for previous instant messaging sessions involving the user in question.) When set to False, the Find Previous Conversations option will be available when you right-click a user in your Contacts list.

Note that this setting only applies to users who are not running Outlook in cached mode.
That's because any searches conducted by those users must take place on the Exchange Servers and administrators might want to limit the network traffic causes by these searches.
If you are running Outlook in cached mode, searches take place on a user's locally-cached copy of his or her Inbox.
Cached searches are not affected by this setting.

The hot-desk timeout specifies the number of minutes that can elapse before a user is automatically logged off of a hot-desk phone.
When specifying a hot desking timeout you must use the format hours:minutes:seconds.
For example, this syntax sets the hot desking timeout interval to 45 minutes:

`-HotdeskingTimeout 00:45:00`

Note that this policy setting applies only to common area phones and not to users.

### -PolicyEntry
Provides a way to add settings not covered by the default parameters.
For example, when testing pre-release versions Microsoft Lync Server 2010 it was possible to add a Send Feedback option to Microsoft Lync 2010.
That was done by using code similar to this:

`$x = New-CsClientPolicyEntry -Name "OnlineFeedbackURL" -Value "http://www.litwareinc.com/feedback"`

`Set-CsClientPolicy -Identity global -PolicyEntry @{Add=$x}`

For more details and examples, see the `New-CsClientPolicyEntry` cmdlet help topic.

### -SearchPrefixFlags
Represents the Address Book attributes that should be used any time a user searches for a new contact.
The search prefix flags are constructed as a binary number such as 11101111, in which a 1 indicates that the attribute should be searched and a 0 indicates that the attribute should not be searched.
The attributes in the binary value are (from right to left):

Primary email address

Email alias

All email addresses

Company

Display name

First name

Last name

The binary value 1110111 means that all attributes should be searched except attribute 4: Company.
To search only display name, first name, and last name you would construct this value:

1110000

After the binary value has been constructed it must then be converted to a decimal value before being assigned to SearchPrefixFlags.
To convert a binary number to a decimal number you can use the following Windows PowerShell command:

`\[Convert\]::ToInt32("1110111", 2)`

SPSearchCenterInternalURL represents the URL for internal users; that is, for users logging on from inside the organization's firewall.
The parameter SPSearchCenterExternalURL is for users who log on from outside the firewall.
