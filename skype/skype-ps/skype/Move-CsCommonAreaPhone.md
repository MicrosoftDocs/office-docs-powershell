## DESCRIPTION

Common area phones are IP telephones that are not associated with an individual user.
Instead of being located in someone's office, common area phones are typically located in building lobbies, cafeterias, employee lounges, meeting rooms and other locations where a large number of people are likely to gather.
This presents administrators with a management challenge; that's because phone use in Skype for Business Server is typically maintained by using voice policies and dial plans that are assigned to individual users.
Common area phones do not have individual users assigned to them.

The solution to this challenge is to create Active Directory contact objects for all your common area phones.
(These contact objects can be created by using the New-CsCommonAreaPhone cmdlet.) Like user accounts, these contact objects can be assigned policies and voice plans.
As a result, you will be able to maintain control over common area phones even though those phones are not associated with an individual user.
For example, if you do not want people to have the ability to transfer or park calls from a common area phone, you can create a voice policy that prohibits call transfers and call parking, and then assign that policy to the common area phone.
(Or, more correctly, to the contact object that represents the common area phone.)

The Move-CsCommonAreaPhone cmdlet enables you to move an existing common area phone to a new Registrar pool.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

Move-CsCommonAreaPhone -Identity "CN={ce84964a-c4da-4622-ad34-c54ff3ed361f},OU=Redmond,DC=Litwareinc,DC=com" -Target atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
```

The command shown in Example 1 moves the common area phone with the Identity CN={ce84964a-c4da-4622-ad34-c54ff3ed361f},OU=Redmond,DC=Litwareinc,DC=com to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsCommonAreaPhone | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq "Building 31 Cafeteria"} | Move-CsCommonAreaPhone -Target atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
```

In Example 2, the common area phone with the Active Directory display name "Building 31 Cafeteria" is moved to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, the Get-CsCommonAreaPhone cmdlet is first called without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the common area phones currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those phones where the DisplayName attribute is equal to "Building 31 Cafeteria." That filtered collection is then piped to the Move-CsCommonAreaPhone cmdlet, which moves each phone in the collection to atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsCommonAreaPhone | Where-Object {$_.RegistrarPool -match "dublin-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} | Move-CsCommonAreaPhone -Target atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
```

Example 3 moves all the common area phones currently homed on the Registrar pool dublin-cs-001.litwareinc.com to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To carry out this task, the command first calls the Get-CsCommonAreaPhone cmdlet without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the common area phones configured for use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out all the common area phones where the RegistrarPool is equal to dublin-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This collection is then piped to the Move-CsCommonAreaPhone cmdlet, which moves each phone in the collection to the new Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsCommonAreaPhone | Where-Object {$_.RegistrarPool -match "dublin-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} | Move-CsCommonAreaPhone -Target atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -PassThru | Grant-CsVoicePolicy -PolicyName AtlantaVoicePolicy
```

Example 4 is a variation of the command shown in Example 3; in this case, however, the common area phones are not only moved to a new Registrar pool, but are also assigned a new per-user voice policy.
To do this, the PassThru parameter is included when calling the Move-CsCommonAreaPhone cmdlet; this is required in order to pass the common area phone objects through the pipeline.
(By default, the Move-CsCommonAreaPhone cmdlet does not pass objects through the pipeline.) After the phones have been moved, the phone objects are piped to the Grant-CsVoicePolicy cmdlet, which assigns the voice policy AtlantaVoicePolicy to each of the newly-moved phones.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the common area phone.
Common area phones are identified using the Active Directory distinguished name of the associated contact object.
By default, common area phones use a globally unique identifier (GUID) as their common name, which means that phones will typically have an Identity similar to this: CN={ce84964a-c4da-4622-ad34-c54ff3ed361f},OU=Redmond,DC=Litwareinc,DC=com.

```yaml
Type: UserIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All), Identity

Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Target
The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Registrar pool where the common area phone should be moved; for example: atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In addition to a Registrar pool, the Target can also be the FQDN of a hosting provider.

```yaml

### -DomainController
Enables you to connect to the specified domain controller in order to move the common area phone.
To connect to a particular domain controller, include the DomainController parameter followed by the computer name (for example, atl-cs-001) or its FQDN (for example, atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com).

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
