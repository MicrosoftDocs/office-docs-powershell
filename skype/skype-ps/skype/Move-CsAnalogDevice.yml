### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Moves one or more analog devices to a new Registrar pool.
  An analog device is a telephone or other device that is connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.
module: SkypeForBusiness
notes: ""
inputs:
- name: <xref href=" " data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

    String.
    The Move-CsAnalogDevice cmdlet accepts a pipelined string value that represents the Identity of the analog device.
outputs:
- name: <xref href=" " data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    By default, the Move-CsAnalogDevice cmdlet does not return any objects or values.
    However, if you include the PassThru parameter, the cmdlet will return instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.ADConnect.Schema.OCSADAnalogDeviceContact object.

  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 moves the analog device with the Identity CN={ce84964a-c4da-4622-ad34-c54ff3ed361f},OU=Redmond,DC=Litwareinc,DC=com to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsAnalogDevice | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq "Building 14, Room 142"} | Move-CsAnalogDevice -Target atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
  description: |-
    In Example 2, the analog device that has the Active Directory display name, "Building 14, Room 142", is moved to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    To do this, the Get-CsAnalogDevice cmdlet is first called without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the analog devices currently in use in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out all the devices that have the display name "Building 14, Room 142".
    That filtered collection is then piped to the Move-CsAnalogDevice cmdlet, which moves all of the devices in the collection to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsAnalogDevice | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "Building 14*"} | Move-CsAnalogDevice -Target atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 3 moves all of the analog devices that have a display name that begins with the string value "Building 14".
    To carry out this task, the command first calls the Get-CsAnalogDevice cmdlet to return a collection of all the analog devices currently in use in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects all the devices that have a display name that begins with the string value "Building 14".
    The filtered collection is then piped to the Move-CsAnalogDevice cmdlet, which moves each device in the collection to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

    Unique identifier for the analog device.
    Analog devices are identified by using the Active Directory distinguished name of the associated contact object.
    By default, analog devices use a GUID (globally unique identifier) as their common name, which means devices will typically have an Identity similar to this: CN={ce84964a-c4da-4622-ad34-c54ff3ed361f},OU=Redmond,DC=Litwareinc,DC=com.

description: |-
  Analog devices include telephones, fax machines, modems, and teletype/telecommunication device for the deaf (TTY/TDD) devices that are connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
  Unlike devices that take advantage of Enterprise Voice (the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) solution offered by Microsoft), analog devices do not transmit information by using digital packets.
  Instead, information is transmitted by using a continuous signal.
  This signal is commonly referred to as an analog signal; hence the term "analog devices."

  In order to enable administrators to manage analog devices, Skype for Business Server lets you associate analog devices with Active Directory contact objects.
  After a device has been associated with a contact object, you can then manage the analog device by assigning policies and dial plans to the contact.

  The Move-CsAnalogDevice cmdlet provides a way for you to move an existing analog device to a new Registrar pool.
