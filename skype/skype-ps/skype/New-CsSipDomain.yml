examples:
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsSipDomain -Identity fabrikam.com
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 creates a new SIP domain, one that has the Identity fabrikam.com.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsSipDomain -Identity fabrikam.com -IsDefault $True
  description: |-
    Example 2 creates a new SIP domain named fabrikam.com and makes this new domain the default SIP domain.
    By making fabrikam.com the default domain, this command also "demotes" the domain that previously served as the default SIP domain.
    That's because you can have only one default SIP domain.

description: |-
  In order to configure SIP addresses for your users (and thus enable them to use SIP-related software such as Skype for Business), you need two pieces of information: a user ID (for example, Ken.Myer) and a SIP domain (for example, litwareinc.com).
  The SIP domain used to construct a SIP address must be a domain, located within your Active Directory forest, that is authorized to send and receive SIP traffic.
  For example, suppose you have domains named litwareinc.com, fabrikam.com, and contoso.com, but only litwareinc.com has been identified as being a SIP domain.
  In that case, you cannot use a SIP address like sip:Ken.Myer@fabrikam.com or sip:Ken.Myer@contoso.com, at least not until fabrikam.com and contoso.com have been configured as valid SIP domains.
  That is something you can do by running the New-CsSipDomain cmdlet.
