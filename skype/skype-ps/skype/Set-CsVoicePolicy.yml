examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsVoicePolicy UserVoicePolicy2 -AllowSimulRing $false -PstnUsages @{remove="Local"}
  description: |-
    This example sets the AllowSimulRing property to False for the per-user policy UserVoicePolicy2, meaning any users assigned this policy are not enabled for simultaneous ring, a feature that determines whether a second phone (such as a mobile phone) can be set to ring every time the user's office phone rings.
    This command also removes "Local" from the list of PSTN usages for this policy.
    (Note that the Identity parameter is not explicitly specified.
    The Identity parameter is a positional parameter, therefore if you put the identity value first in the list of parameters you don't need to explicitly state that it's the Identity.)

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $a = Get-CsPstnUsage

    Set-CsVoicePolicy -Identity site:Redmond -PstnUsages @{replace=$a.Usage}
  description: |-
    This example modifies the voice policy for site Redmond so that all the PSTN usages defined for the organization are applied to this policy.
    The first line in this example calls the `Get-CsPstnUsage` cmdlet to retrieve the global set of PSTN usages for the organization and save that set in the variable $a.
    The second line calls the `Set-CsVoicePolicy` cmdlet to modify the voice policy for site Redmond.
    A value is passed to the PstnUsages parameter to replace the current list of usages for the policy with the list contained in the global set of PSTN usages.
    Note the syntax of the replace value: $a.Usage.
    This refers to the Usage property of the PSTN usage settings, which contains the list of PSTN usages.

    Policies can be set to limit bandwidth and set various other properties relating to network configuration.

  description: |+
    When set to True, calls to an unanswered mobile device will be routed to the organization voicemail instead of the mobile device provider's voicemail.
    If a call is answered "too soon" (that is, before the value configured for the PSTNVoicemailEscapeTimer property has elapsed) it will be assumed that the mobile device is not available and the call will be routed to the organization voicemail.

    The default value is False.

  name: PreventPSTNTollBypass
  description: |+
    PSTN tolls are more commonly known as long-distance charges.
    Organizations can sometimes bypass these tolls by implementing a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) solution that enables branch offices to connect via network calls.
    Setting this parameter to True will send calls through PSTN and incur charges rather than going through the network and bypassing the tolls.

    A list of PSTN usages available to this policy.
    The PSTN usage ties a voice policy to a phone route.

    Any string value can be placed into this list, as long as the value exists in the current global list of PSTN usages.
    (Duplicate strings are not allowed; all string must be unique.) The list of PSTN usages can be retrieved by calling the `Get-CsPstnUsage` cmdlet.

    Keep in mind that if you use this parameter to remove all PSTN usages from the policy, users granted this policy will not be able to make outbound PSTN calls.
