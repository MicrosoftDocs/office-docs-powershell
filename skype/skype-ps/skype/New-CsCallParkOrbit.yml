  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The name of the call park orbit range.
    This name must be unique within the Skype for Business Server deployment.
    This string can be any value, but should be something that allows for easy identification of the particular call park orbit range.
    All call park orbit ranges are created with a global scope.

    Creates an object reference without actually committing the object as a permanent change.
    If you assign the output of this cmdlet called with this parameter to a variable, you can make changes to the properties of the object reference and then commit those changes by calling this cmdlet's matching Set-\<cmdlet\>.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NumberRangeEnd
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The last number in the range for this call park orbit.
    The value must be greater than or equal to the NumberRangeStart.
    The value must also be the same length as the value of the NumberRangeStart.
    For example, if NumberRangeStart is set to 100, NumberRangeEnd cannot be set to 1001.
    In addition, if the NumberRangeStart begins with a * or #, then NumberRangeEnd must begin with the same character.

    Valid values: Must match the regular expression string (\[\*|#\]?\[1-9\]\d{0,7})|(\[1-9\]\d{0,8}).
    This means that the value must be a string beginning with either the character * or # or a number 1 through 9 (the first character cannot be a zero).
    If the first character is * or # the following character must be a number 1 through 9 (it cannot be a zero).
    Subsequent characters can be any number 0 through 9 up to seven additional characters.
    (For example, #6000, *92000, and *95551212.) If the first character is not * or #, the first character must be a number 1 through 9 (it cannot be zero), followed by up to eight characters, each a number 0 through 9.
    (For example: 915551212;41212;300)

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="OrbitType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Type
  description: |+
    Specifies the type of call park orbit being created.
    Skype for Business Server allows for two different types of call park orbits:

    CallPark.
    This is the standard call park orbit, in which a user places a call on hold and then can retrieve that call from any phone by dialing the specified call park number.
    CallPark is the default orbit type and will be used if the Type parameter is not specified.

    GroupPickup.
    With group pickup, users can answer any incoming call that is made to any member of their call pickup group.
    Call pickup groups are configured by administrators.

    To specify a call park orbit type, use syntax similar to this:

    `-Type GroupPickup`

    This parameter was introduced in the February 2013 release of Lync Server 2013.

description: |-
  Parking a call assigns a received phone call to a specific number for later retrieval.
  A call park orbit range is the set of call park locations assigned to a specific Call Park service for this purpose.
  The New-CsCallParkOrbit cmdlet defines the numbers for a call park orbit range and applies them to a specific service.
  Calls parked within the given range will be parked on the specified Call Park service.
  You can create multiple call park orbits; each must have a globally unique name and a unique range of numbers.
