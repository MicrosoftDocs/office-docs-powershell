examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsClientPolicy
  description: |-
    In Example 1, Get-CsClientPolicy is called without any additional parameters; this returns a collection of all the client policies configured for use in your organization.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsClientPolicy -Identity SalesPolicy
  description: |-
    In Example 2, Get-CsClientPolicy is used to return the per-user client policy that has an Identity SalesPolicy.
    Because identities are unique, this command will never return more than one item.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsClientPolicy -Filter "tag:*"
  description: |-
    Example 3 uses the Filter parameter to return all the client policies that have been configured at the per-user scope.
    The filter value "tag:*" tells Get-CsClientPolicy to return only those policies that have an Identity that begins with the string value "tag:".
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsClientPolicy | Where-Object {$_.DisableSavingIM -eq $True}
  description: |-
    The preceding command returns a collection of all the client policies where the DisableSavingIM property is True.
    To do this, Get-CsClientPolicy is first called without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the client policies configured for use in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those policies where the DisableSavingIM property is equal to True.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 5 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsClientPolicy | Where-Object {$_.DisableSavingIM -eq $True -and $_.EnableIMAutoArchiving -eq $False}
  description: |-
    In Example 5, the only client policies returned are the policies that meet two criteria: the DisableSavingIM property must be True and the EnableIMAutoArchiving property must be False.
    To do this, the command first calls Get-CsClientPolicy in order to return a collection of all the client policies configured for use in the organization.
    That collection is then piped to Where-Object, which picks out only those policies that meet both of the following criteria: DisableSavingIM must be equal to True and EnableIMAutoArchiving must be equal to False.
    The -and operator tells Where-Object that only objects that meet all the specified criteria should be selected.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 6 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsClientPolicy | Where-Object {$_.DisableSavingIM -eq $True -or $_.EnableIMAutoArchiving -eq $False}
  description: |-
    Example 6 is a variation of the command shown in Example 5.
    This time, however, policies are selected as long as they meet at least one of the following criteria: either the DisableSavingIM property is True and/or the EnableIMAutoArchiving property is False.
    To accomplish this task, the command first calls Get-CsClientPolicy to return a collection of all the client policies configured for use in the organization.
    That collection is then piped to Where-Object, which picks out only those policies that meet at least one of the following criteria: DisableSavingIM is equal to True and/or EnableIMAutoArchiving is equal to False.
    The -or operator tells Where-Object that any object that meets at least one of the specified conditions should be selected.

description: |-
  Client policies are applied each time a user accesses the system, regardless of where the user logs on from and regardless of the type of device the user logs on with.
  In addition, client policies, like other Skype for Business policies, can readily be targeted to selected groups of users.
  You can even create a custom policy that gets assigned to a single user.

  Client policies can be configured at the global, site, and per-user scopes.
  The Get-CsClientPolicy cmdlet enables you to return information about all the client policies that have been configured for use in your organization.
