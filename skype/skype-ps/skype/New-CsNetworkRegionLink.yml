  code: |-
    New-CsNetworkRegionLink -Identity NA_EMEA -NetworkRegionID1 NorthAmerica -NetworkRegionID2 EMEA -BWPolicyProfileID LowBWLimits
  description: |-
    This example creates a new network region link named NA_EMEA to link the regions NorthAmerica and EMEA.
    The region link name is specified as the value for the Identity parameter.
    (This will automatically be assigned as the value of the NetworkRegionLinkID.) The two network regions being linked are required parameters for creating the link, in this case the regions named NorthAmerica and EMEA.
    In this example we've also assigned a value to the BWPolicyProfile parameter.
    This will assign the bandwidth limitations defined in that bandwidth policy profile (LowBWLimits) to connections between these regions.
    If no BWPolicyProfileID is supplied, there are no bandwidth limitations on connections between these two regions.
    (There could still be limitations between sites.
    For details, see the New-CsNetworkSite cmdlet help topic.)

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BWPolicyProfileID
  description: |+
    The Identity of the bandwidth policy profile that will define the bandwidth limitations for this link.
