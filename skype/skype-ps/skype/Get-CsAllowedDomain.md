# Get-CsAllowedDomain

## SYNOPSIS
Returns information about the domains included on the list of domains approved for federation.
After a domain has been approved for federation (by being added to the allowed list), your users can exchange instant messages and presence information with people who have accounts in that domain.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Get-CsAllowedDomain [[-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity>] [-LocalStore] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Filter
```
Get-CsAllowedDomain [-Filter <String>] [-LocalStore] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Federation is a means by which two organizations can set up a trust relationship that facilitates communication between the two groups.
When federation has been established, users in the two organizations can send each other instant messages, subscribe for presence notifications, and otherwise communicate with one another by using SIP applications such as Skype for Business.
Skype for Business Server allows for three types of federation: 1) direct federation between your organization and another; 2) federation between your organization and a public provider; and 3) federation between your organization and a third-party hosting provider.

Setting up direct federation with another organization involves several tasks.
To begin with, you must enable your Access Edge servers to allow federation.
In addition, the other organization must enable federation with you; federation cannot be established unless both parties agree to the relationship.

To set up a federated relationship you might also need to manage two federation-related lists: the allowed list and the blocked list.
The allowed list (required if EnablePartnerDiscovery has been disabled) represents the organizations you have chosen to federate with.
If a domain appears on the allowed list then (depending on your configuration settings) your users will be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with users who have accounts in that federated domain.
Conversely, the blocked list represents domains that users are expressly forbidden from federating with; for example, messages sent from a blocked domain will automatically be rejected by Skype for Business Server.

The Get-CsAllowedDomain cmdlet provides a way for you to return information about all the domains on the allowed domains list.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-CsAllowedDomain
```

The command shown in Example 1 returns a collection of all the domains included in the list of domains approved for federation.
Calling the Get-CsAllowedDomain cmdlet without any additional parameters always returns the complete collection of approved domains.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsAllowedDomain -Identity fabrikam.com
```

Example 2 returns information about the allowed domain with the Identity "fabrikam.com".
Because identities must be unique, this command will never return more than one item.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsAllowedDomain -Filter *fabrikam*
```

The command shown in Example 3 returns a collection of all the allowed domains that have the string value "fabrikam" anywhere in their Identity.
To do this, the command uses the Filter parameter and the filter value "*fabrikam*".
This filter value tells the Get-CsAllowedDomain cmdlet to return only those domains where the Identity (the only property you can filter on) includes the string value "fabrikam".
Domains such as fabrikam.com, fabrikam.net, and africa.fabrikam.org will all be returned by this command.

### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```
Where-Object {$_.ProxyFqdn -ne $Null}

Get-CsAllowedDomain | Where-Object {$_.ProxyFqdn -eq $Null}
```

In Example 4, the Get-CsAllowedDomain cmdlet and the Where-Object cmdlet are used to return a collection of all the domains where no value has been entered for the ProxyFqdn property.
To carry out this task, the Get-CsAllowedDomain cmdlet is first called without any additional parameters in order to return a collection of all the allowed domains.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those allowed domains where the ProxyFqdn property is equal to a null value; a null value means that no value has been entered for ProxyFqdn.
To find all the domains that have a value of some kind configured for the ProxyFqdn property, use this syntax instead:

### -------------------------- Example 5 --------------------------
```
Get-CsAllowedDomain | Where-Object {$_.MarkForMonitoring -eq $True}
```

Example 5 returns all the allowed domains that have their health status checked by the Monitoring Server.
To do this, the Get-CsAllowedDomain cmdlet is first used to return a collection of all the domains on the allowed domains list.
That collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those domains where the MarkForMonitoring property is equal to True.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Name of the domain to be returned.
Domains are listed on the allowed list by their fully qualified domain name (FQDN); that means that the Identity for a given domain will be similar to fabrikam.com or contoso.net.
Note that you cannot use wildcards when specifying a domain Identity.
To use wildcards to return a given domain (or set of domains), use the Filter parameter instead.

If this parameter is not specified, then all of the domains on the allowed domain list will be returned.

```yaml
Type: XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter
Enables you to use wildcard characters in order to return one or more domains from the list of allowed domains.

To return all of the domains that have an Identity that begins with the letter "r", use this syntax: `-Filter r*`

To return all of the domains that have an Identity that ends with ".net", use this syntax: `-Filter "*.net"`

To return all of the domains that have an Identity that begins with the letter "r" or with the letter "g", use this syntax: `-Filter \[rg\]*`

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: Filter
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LocalStore
Retrieves the allowed domains from the local replica of the Central Management store rather than from the Central Management store itself.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
