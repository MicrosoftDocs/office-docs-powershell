# Get-CsHostingProvider

## SYNOPSIS
Returns information about the hosting providers configured for use in your organization.
A hosting provider is a third-party organization that provides instant messaging, presence, and related services for a domain that you would like to federate with.
Hosting providers differ from public providers (such as Yahoo!, MSN, and AOL) in that their services are not offered to the general public.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

## DESCRIPTION
Federation is a means by which two organizations can set up a trust relationship that facilitates communication between the two groups.
When federation has been established, users in the two organizations can send each other instant messages, subscribe for presence notifications, and otherwise communicate with one another using SIP applications such as Skype for Business.
Skype for Business Server allows for three types of federation: 1) direct federation between your organization and another; 2) federation between your organization and a public provider; and, 3) federation between your organization and a third-party hosting provider.

A hosting provider is an organization that provides SIP communication services for other organizations; for example, Fabrikam, Inc.
might host users from Contoso, Northwind Traders, and Wingtip Toys.
When you establish a federation relationship with a hosting provider, you effectively establish federation with any organization hosted by that provider.
For example, if you federate with Fabrikam, your users will be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with users from Contoso, Northwind Traders, and Wingtip Toys.

Hosting providers are also used in split domain scenarios.
In a split domain scenario, some of your Skype for Business Server users have accounts hosted on-premises (that is, hosted on your local implementation of Skype for Business Server).
Other users have their accounts maintained off-premises by the third-party hosting provider.
Federating with the hosting provider enables on-premises and off-premises users to communicate with one another.

The Get-CsHostingProvider cmdlet provides a way for you to return information about all the hosting providers that have been configured for use in your organization.

Note that you cannot federate with a hosting provider if your Edge Servers are configured to use default routing rather than Domain Name System (DNS) server routing.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-CsHostingProvider
```

Example 1 returns a collection of all the hosting providers configured for use in the organization.
Calling the Get-CsHostingProvider cmdlet without any additional parameters returns the complete collection of hosting providers.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsHostingProvider -Identity Fabrikam.com
```

Example 2 returns the hosting provider that has the Identity Fabrikam.com.
Because Identities must be unique among hosting providers, this command will never return more than a single item.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsHostingProvider -Filter *.org
```

The command shown in Example 3 returns a collection of all the hosting providers that have an Identity that ends with the string value ".org" (for example, fabrikam.org and contoso.org).

### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```
Get-CsHostingProvider | Where-Object {$_.Enabled -eq $True}
```

In Example 4, all the hosting providers that are currently enabled for use are returned.
To do this, the Get-CsHostingProvider cmdlet is first called in order to return a collection of all the hosting providers currently configured for use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those providers where the Enabled property is equal to True.

### -------------------------- Example 5 --------------------------
```
Get-CsHostingProvider | Where-Object {$_.Enabled -eq $True -and $_.EnabledSharedAddressSpace -eq $True}
```

Example 5 returns all the hosting providers that have a shared address space and that host Skype for Business Server 2015 users; by definition, that means that the command returns all the hosting providers that are part of a "split-domain" setup.
(Split domain simply means that some of your Skype for Business Server 2015 accounts are maintained on-premises while other accounts are maintained by a hosting provider.) To carry out this task, the command first uses the Get-CsHostingProvider cmdlet to return a collection of all the currently configured hosting providers.
This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those providers that meet two criteria: 1) the Enabled property is equal to True; and, 2) the EnabledSharedAddressSpace property is equal to True.

### -------------------------- Example 6 --------------------------
```
Get-CsHostingProvider | Select-Object *
```

The command shown in Example 6 displays all the property values for all the hosting providers configured for use in your organization.
By default, the property values for EnabledSharedAddressSpace and HostsOCSUsers are not displayed when you run the Get-CsHostingProvider cmdlet.
To see the values for these properties, the information returned by the Get-CsHostingProvider cmdlet is piped to the Select-Object cmdlet; the wildcard character (*) instructs the Select-Object cmdlet to display all the properties and property values for the returned items.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the hosting provider to be returned.
The Identity might be the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the hosting provider (for example, fabrikam.com) or perhaps the name of the company providing the services (Fabrikam, Inc.).

If this parameter is not specified, the Get-CsHostingProvider cmdlet will return a collection of all the hosting providers configured for use in your organization.
