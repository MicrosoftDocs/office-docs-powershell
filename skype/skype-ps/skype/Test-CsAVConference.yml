    Test-CsAVConference -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
  description: |-
    Example 1 checks to see if a pair of preconfigured test users can log on to the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com and then participate in an A/V conference.
    This command will work only if test users have been defined for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    If they have, then the command will determine whether the two users can log on to the system.
    If so, the first test user will create an A/V conference and invite the second user to join; the cmdlet will then verify whether or not the two test users were able to make a successful connection.

    If test users have not been defined, then the command will fail because it will not know which users to employ when doing the test.
    If you have not defined test users for a pool then you must include the SenderSipAddress and ReceiverSipAddress parameters as well as the corresponding credentials for the users involved in the instant messaging exchange.
    The `Test-CsAVConference` cmdlet will then conduct its checks using the two specified users.

  code: |-
    $cred1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"

    $cred2 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

    Test-CsAVConference -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -SenderSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $cred1 -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -ReceiverCredential $cred2
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 test the ability of a pair of users (litwareinc\pilar and litwareinc\kenmyer) to log on to Skype for Business Server and then participate in an A/V conference.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell credential object containing the name and password of the user Pilar Ackerman.
    (Because the logon name, litwareinc\pilar, has been included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box only requires the administrator to enter the password for the Pilar Ackerman account.) The resulting credential object is then stored in a variable named $cred1.
    The second command does the same thing, this time returning a credential object for the Ken Myer account.

    With the two credential objects in hand, the third command in the example determines whether or not the two users can log on to Skype for Business Server and then participate in an A/V conference.
    To carry out this task, the `Test-CsAVConference` cmdlet is called, along with the following parameters: TargetFqdn (the FQDN of the Registrar pool); SenderSipAddress (the SIP address for the first test user); SenderCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for this same user); ReceiverSipAddress (the SIP address for the other test user); and ReceiverCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for the other user).

description: |-
  The `Test-CsAVConference` cmdlet is an example of a "synthetic transaction." Synthetic transactions are used in Skype for Business Server to verify that users are able to successfully complete common tasks such as logging on to the system, exchanging instant messages, or making calls to a phone located on the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
  These tests can be conducted manually by an administrator, or they can be automatically run by an application such as Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (formerly Microsoft Operations Manager).

  Synthetic transactions are typically conducted in two different ways.
  Many administrators will use the `CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration` cmdlets to set up test users for each of their Registrar pools.
  These test users are a pair of users who have been preconfigured for use with synthetic transactions.
  (Typically these are test accounts and not accounts that belong to actual users.) With test users configured for a pool, administrators can run a synthetic transaction against that pool without having to specify the identities of (and supply the credentials for) the user accounts involved in the test.

  Alternatively, administrators can run a synthetic transaction by using actual user accounts.
  For example, if two users are unable to exchange instant messages, an administrator could run a synthetic transaction using those two user accounts (as opposed to a pair of test accounts), and then try to diagnose and resolve the problem.
  If you decide to conduct a synthetic transaction using actual user accounts, you will need to supply the logon names and passwords for each user.

  The `Test-CsAVConference` cmdlet checks to see if two test users are able to conduct an A/V conference.
  When the cmdlet runs, the two users are logged on to the system.
  After they are successfully logged on, the first user creates an A/V conference, and then waits for the second user to join that conference.
  After a brief exchange of data, the conference is deleted and the two tests users are logged off.

  The `Test-CsAVConference` cmdlet does not actually conduct an A/V conference between the two test users.
  Instead, the cmdlet verifies that the two users can make the connections necessary to carry out an A/V conference.
