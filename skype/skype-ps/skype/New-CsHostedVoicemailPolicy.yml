  code: |-
    New-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond -Destination ExUM.fabrikam.com -Description "Hosted voicemail policy for Redmond users." -Organization "corp1.litwareinc.com, corp2.litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    This command creates a new hosted voice mail policy named ExRedmond.
    (The fact that no scope is specified means that this policy can be assigned to individual users or contacts.) This policy defines the Exchange UM destination for this policy to be at FQDN ExUM.fabrikam.com.
    In addition, the Skype for Business Server users of this policy can be spread across the corp1 and corp2 organizations of litwareinc.
    This policy is described as (has a Description parameter value of) "Hosted voice mail property for Redmond users."

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $x = New-CsHostedVoiceMailPolicy -Identity global -Tenant "73d355dd-ce5d-4ab9-bf49-7b822c18dd98" -Destination ExUM.fabrikam.com -Description "Hosted voicemail policy for Redmond users." -Organization "corp1.litwareinc.com, corp2.litwareinc.com"

    Set-CsHostedVoiceMailPolicy -Instance $x -Tenant "73d355dd-ce5d-4ab9-bf49-7b822c18dd98"
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 are a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the new hosted voicemail policy is assigned to the Skype for Business Online tenant with the tenant ID 73d355dd-ce5d-4ab9-bf49-7b822c18dd98.
    To create a new policy for a Skype for Business Online tenant you must include the InMemory parameter and store the resulting policy in a variable.
    That's what happens in the first command, with the new policy stored in a variable named $x.
    Note, too that you must set the Identity to Global and the Tenant parameter to the appropriate tenant ID.

    To create the new policy, the second command then calls the Set-CsHostedVoiceMailPolicy cmdlet along with the Instance parameter and the Tenant parameter.

uid: SkypeForBusiness.New-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy
name: New-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy
description: |-
  This cmdlet creates a policy that configures a user account enabled for Skype for Business Server to use an Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) hosted voice mail service.
  The policy determines how to route unanswered calls to the user to a hosted Exchange UM service.

  A user must be enabled for Exchange UM hosted voice mail for this policy to take effect.
  You can call the Get-CsUser cmdlet and check the HostedVoiceMail property to determine whether a user is enabled for hosted voice mail.
  (A value of True means the user is enabled.)

  Policies created at the site scope will be automatically assigned to the users homed on those sites.
  Policies created at the per-user scope must be assigned to users or contact objects with the Grant-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy cmdlet.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Cloud Voicemail takes the place of Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) in providing voice messaging functionality for Skype for Business 2019 voice users who have mailboxes on Exchange Server 2019 or Exchange Online, and for Skype for Business Online voice users.
