# Test-CsExUMVoiceMail

## SYNOPSIS
Verifies that a user can connect to Exchange Unified Messaging and leave a voice mail message for another user.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.


## SYNTAX

### ClientPlatform
```
Test-CsExUMVoiceMail [[-TargetFqdn] <String>] -SenderCredential <PSCredential>
 [-Authentication <AuthenticationMechanism>] [-Force] [-OutLoggerVariable <String>]
 [-OutVerboseVariable <String>] -ReceiverSipAddress <String> [-RegistrarPort <Int32>]
 -SenderSipAddress <String> [-WaveFile <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ServerPlatform
```
Test-CsExUMVoiceMail [-TargetFqdn] <String> [-Authentication <AuthenticationMechanism>] [-Force]
 [-OutLoggerVariable <String>] [-OutVerboseVariable <String>] [-ReceiverSipAddress <String>]
 [-RegistrarPort <Int32>] [-SenderSipAddress <String>] [-WaveFile <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Test-CsExUMVoiceMail` cmdlet enables administrators to verify that a user can access, and make use of, the Exchange unified messaging service.
To do this, the cmdlet connects to the unified messaging service and leaves a voice mail in the specified mailbox.
This can be a system-supplied voice mail, or it can be a custom .WAV file that you have recorded yourself.

Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Test-CsExUMVoiceMail` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Test-CsExUMVoiceMail -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"
```

The preceding example tests Exchange Unified Messaging voice mail connectivity for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This command will work only if test users have been defined for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
If they have, then the command will determine whether or not the first test user is able to use Unified Messaging voice mail.
If test users have not been configured for the pool then the command will fail.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
$credential = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"

Test-CsExUMVoiceMail -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -SenderSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $credential
```

The commands shown in Example 2 test Exchange Unified Messaging voice mail connectivity for the user litwareinc\kenmyer.
To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell command-line interface credentials object for the user litwareinc\kenmyer.
Note that you must supply the password for this account in order to create a valid credentials object and to ensure that the `Test-CsExUMVoiceMail` cmdlet can carry out its check.

The second command in the example uses the supplied credentials object ($x) and the SIP address of the user litwareinc\kenmyer in order to determine whether or this user can connect to Exchange Unified Messaging voice mail.


### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Test-CsExUMVoiceMail -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -OutLoggerVariable VoicemailTest

$VoicemailTest.ToXML() | Out-File C:\Logs\VoicemailTest.xml
```

The command shown in Example 3 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the OutLoggerVariable parameter is included in order to generate a detailed log of every step undertaken by the `Test-CsExUMVoiceMail` cmdlet, as well as the success or failure of each of those steps.
To do this, the OutLoggerVariable parameter is added along with the parameter value ExumText; that causes detailed logging information to be stored in a variable named $ExumTest.
In the final command in the example, the ToXML() method is used to convert the log information to XML format.
That XML data is then written to a file named C:\Logs\VoicemailTest.xml by using the `Out-File` cmdlet.


## PARAMETERS

### -SenderCredential
User credential object for the user account that will be leaving the voicemail message.
The value passed to SenderCredential must be an object reference obtained by using the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.
For example, this code returns a credentials object for the user litwareinc\kenmyer and stores that object in a variable named $x:

`$x = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"`

You need to supply the user password when running this command.

The sender credential is not required if you are running the test under the health monitoring configuration settings for the pool.
