# Set-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a Location Information Server (LIS) wireless access point (WAP), creates an association between a WAP and a location (creating a new location if that location doesn't exist), or modifies an existing WAP and its associated location.
The association between a WAP and location is used in an Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) Enterprise Voice implementation to notify an emergency services operator of the caller's location.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

## DESCRIPTION
Enhanced 9-1-1 allows an emergency operator to identify the location of a caller without having to ask the caller for that information.
In the case where a caller is calling from a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connection, that information must be extracted based on various connection factors.
The VoIP administrator must configure a location map (called a wiremap) that will determine a caller's location.
This cmdlet allows the administrator to map physical locations to the WAP through which calls will be routed.

The BSSID parameter is the only required parameter for this cmdlet.
If you enter a BSSID value that already exists, this cmdlet will update the location for that WAP based on the location parameters that are supplied.
If the BSSID does not exist, a new WAP location will be created.

If a location with an address exactly matching the address parameters entered here (including null values) does not exist in the location database, a new address will be created based on the parameters entered with this cmdlet.
(You can retrieve a list of locations by calling the `Get-CsLisLocation` cmdlet.) The `Set-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint` cmdlet does not require or prompt for location parameters; you can create a WAP entry without associating it with a location.
It's also possible to create an invalid location with this cmdlet.
A valid location consists of, at minimum, the Location, HouseNumber, StreetName, City, State and Country.
If you do not supply all of these parameters, calls that are received by the referenced WAP may not contain the information required by the emergency operator.
It is recommended that you be as specific as possible with the location parameters and fill in as many as possible.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint -BSSID 99-99-99-99-99-99
```

Example 1 creates or updates a LIS WAP location entry.
The command in this example includes only one (required) parameter: BSSID.
The value of the BSSID is the identifier (in the form of a MAC address) of the WAP, in this case 99-99-99-99-99-99.

Notice that this example does not include any address information.
It's possible to create a WAP entry on the Location Information Server without associating it with an address.
However, emergency calls routed through this WAP may not contain enough information for the emergency operator to identify a location.

IMPORTANT: If a LIS WAP location with this BSSID already exists, it will be replaced by the values in this command.
That means that if this WAP were associated with an address (a physical location), that association would no longer exist because we didn't include any location information in this command.
The location will still exist in the location database, but it will not be associated with this WAP.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Set-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint -BSSID 99-99-99-99-99-99 -Location "30/1000" -HouseNumber 1234 -PreDirectional NE -StreetName First -StreetSuffix Avenue -City Redmond -State WA -Country US -PostalCode 99999
```

Example 2 updates the WAP created in Example 1 by adding address information.
(This is actually deleting the existing entry and replacing it with this new entry.) If the address does not exist in the location database, this cmdlet will create that location.


## PARAMETERS

### -BSSID
The Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) of the wireless access point.
This value must be in the form nn-nn-nn-nn-nn-nn, such as 12-34-56-78-90-ab.
If an entry with the specified BSSID value does not exist, a new WAP location will be created.
If an entry with the specified BSSID does exist, that entry will be replaced.
