examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond -Destination ExUM.contoso.com
  description: |-
    This command modifies the Destination property of a hosted voice mail policy named ExRedmond.
    It sets the Exchange UM destination for this policy to be at FQDN ExUM.contoso.com.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $a = (Get-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond).Organization

    $a += ",corp3.litwareinc.com"

    Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity ExRedmond -Organization $a
  description: |-
    This command adds an Exchange tenant to the comma-separated list of tenants (organizations) for the policy ExRedmond.
    The first line calls the `Get-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy` cmdlet to retrieve the policy with the Identity ExRedmond.
    This cmdlet call is in parentheses because we need to first retrieve this policy.
    We then use "dot notation" to retrieve the Organization property of the policy.
    We save the returned string in the variable $a.
    The next line uses the += operator to append the assigned string (,corp3.litwareinc.com) to the end of the string stored in variable $a.
    (Note the comma in the assigned string.
    Organization is a comma-separated list, so if there's already a value in the list any additional values need to be preceded by a comma.) Finally, in the last line we call the `Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy` cmdlet and assign the new Organization string by passing the variable $a to the parameter Organization.

name: Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy
description: |-
  This cmdlet modifies a policy that configures a user account enabled for Skype for Business Server to use an Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) hosted voice mail service.
  The policy determines how to route unanswered calls to the user to a hosted Exchange UM service.

  A user must be enabled for Exchange UM hosted voice mail for this policy to take effect.
  You can call the `Get-CsUser` cmdlet and check the HostedVoiceMail property to determine whether a user is enabled for hosted voice mail.
  (A value of True means the user is enabled.)
