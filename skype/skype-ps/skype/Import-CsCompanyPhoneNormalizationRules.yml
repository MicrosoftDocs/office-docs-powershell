description: |-
  Address Book phone normalization rule configurations have been migrated from the plain text file Company_Phone_Number_Normalization_Rules.txt to central management configuration in Skype for Business Server for easier and more convenient manageability.
  In order for the Skype for Business Server Address Book service to pick up custom normalization rules, normalization rule definitions must be in the central management configuration store.
  The Import-CsCompanyPhoneNormalizationRules cmdlet reads all custom normalization rules defined in the file specified by the FileName parameter and ensures the same normalization rules exist in the central management configuration store.
  Company_Phone_Number_Normalization_Rules.txt and phone normalization rules defined in central management store must be kept in sync until the environment is fully migrated to Skype for Business Server.

  The Import-CsCompanyPhoneNormalizationRules cmdlet uses GUID names for the new normalization rules as name is required in the Skype for Business Server configuration schema, and does not exist in the legacy normalization file format.
  These GUID names can be replaced with more appropriate values by using Set-CsAddressBookNormalizationConfiguration cmdlet after the migration is completed.

  Alternatively, the New-CsAddressBookNormalizationConfiguration and Set-CsAddressBookNormalizationConfiguration cmdlets can also be used to keep custom normalization rule definitions in sync.
