uid: SkypeForBusiness.Remove-CsVoiceNormalizationRule
name: Remove-CsVoiceNormalizationRule
description: |-
  This cmdlet removes a named voice normalization rule.
  These rules are a required part of phone authorization and call routing.
  They define the requirements for converting (or translating) numbers from an internal Skype for Business Server format to a standard (E.164) format.
  An understanding of regular expressions is helpful in order to define number patterns that will be translated.

  Rules that are removed by using this cmdlet will be deleted from the dial plans of the organization, so they won't be returned by the `Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet and will not appear in the NormalizationRules property returned by a call to the `Get-CsDialPlan` cmdlet.
  This means that calling the `Remove-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet could leave a dial plan with no normalization rules.
