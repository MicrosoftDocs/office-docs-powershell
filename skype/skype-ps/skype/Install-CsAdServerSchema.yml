  Although Skype for Business Server stores most of its configuration information in its own database, the software also relies on Active Directory Domain Services as a storage location; for example, user-related information is stored as part of the user's Active Directory account.
  In order to do this, Skype for Business Server must store these values in attributes that are not part of the typical Active Directory user account.
  In turn, that means you must "extend" your Active Directory schema: the schema must be modified to add custom attributes (and other items) required by Skype for Business Server.

  The easiest way to extend the Active Directory schema is to use the Install-CsAdServerSchema cmdlet.
  The Install-CsAdServerSchema cmdlet is typically run as part of the Skype for Business Server setup process but, if need be, administrators can run the cmdlet at any time.
  After the cmdlet finishes running, you can then use the Get-CsAdServerSchema cmdlet to verify that the schema has been updated and that Active Directory is ready for the next step in the installation process.

  Note that, when the Install-CsAdServerSchema cmdlet runs, the cmdlet must have access to the schema master, the operations master role that manages Active Directory object and attribute definitions.
  If you are running the Install-CsAdServerSchema cmdlet on a computer other than the schema master, the computer that hosts the schema master must allow remote access to the registry.
  If it does not, then you must run the Install-CsAdServerSchema cmdlet on the schema master itself.
