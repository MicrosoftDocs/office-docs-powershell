  The backup service configuration settings are used to manage pool backups in Skype for Business Server.
  Note that Skype for Business Server allows only for a single, global collection of backup configuration settings.
  Among other things, that means that all your pools must be backed up using the same synchronization schedule and that users and groups authorized to backup Pool A are also allowed to backup Pools B, C, D and E.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Remove-CsBackupServiceConfiguration` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
