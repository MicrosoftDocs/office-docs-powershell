# Remove-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute

## SYNOPSIS
Removes a route that connects network regions within a call admission control (CAC) configuration.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute [-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Every region within a CAC configuration must have some way to access every other region.
While region links set bandwidth limitations on the connections between regions and also represent the physical links, a route determines which linked path the connection will traverse from one region to another.
This cmdlet removes one of these route associations.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Remove-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute -Identity NA_APAC_Route
```

Example 1 removes the route with the Identity NA_APAC_Route.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute | Where-Object {$_.NetworkRegionID1 -eq "NorthAmerica" -or $_.NetworkRegionID2 -eq "NorthAmerica"} | Remove-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute
```

Example 2 removes all region routes that include the NorthAmerica region.
The first part of the command is a call to the `Get-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute` cmdlet.
This cmdlet, called with no parameters, will retrieve all region routes.
Next, this collection of routes is piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet.
The `Where-Object` cmdlet will narrow the collection down to only those routes that have NorthAmerica defined as one of the regions in the route.
It does this by checking to see if the route has a NetworkRegionID1 value equal to (-eq) NorthAmerica, or (-or) a NetworkRegionID2 value equal to NorthAmerica.
Once the collection contains only the routes that include the NorthAmerica region, we pipe the collection to the `Remove-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute` cmdlet, which removes each of those routes.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The unique identifier for the network region route you want to remove.
Network region routes are created only at the global scope, so this identifier does not need to specify a scope.
Instead, it contains a string that is a unique name that identifies that route.
