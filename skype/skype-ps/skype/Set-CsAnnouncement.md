# Set-CsAnnouncement

## SYNOPSIS
Modifies the property values of an existing Skype for Business Server announcement.
Announcements are played when users dial a valid but unassigned phone number.
An announcement can be a message (such as "This number is temporarily out of service") or a busy signal.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Set-CsAnnouncement [[-Identity] <XdsIdentity>] [-Name <String>] [-AudioFilePrompt <String>]
 [-TextToSpeechPrompt <String>] [-Language <String>] [-TargetUri <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Instance
```
Set-CsAnnouncement [-Instance <PSObject>] [-Name <String>] [-AudioFilePrompt <String>]
 [-TextToSpeechPrompt <String>] [-Language <String>] [-TargetUri <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
An organization can own phone numbers that are not assigned to users or phones, but that are still valid numbers that can be called.
By default when someone dials one of those numbers, that person will receive a busy signal and the call may result in an error returned to the SIP client.
By applying announcement settings to unassigned numbers, administrators have the option of playing a message, returning a busy signal, or redirecting the call.
This cmdlet modifies these announcement settings.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Get-CsAnnouncement | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "Help Desk Announcement"} | Set-CsAnnouncement -AudioFilePrompt "helpdesk.wav"
```

The command shown in Example 1 assigns a new audio file to the Help Desk announcement.
To perform this task, the command first uses the `Get-CsAnnouncement` cmdlet, without any parameters, to return a collection of all the announcements currently available.
This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks the one announcement where the Name is equal to (-eq) "Help Desk Announcement".
In turn, that announcement is then piped to the `Set-CsAnnouncement` cmdlet, which sets the value of the AudioFilePrompt property to helpdesk.wav.

Note that if this announcement already has a TextToSpeechPrompt value assigned to it, this command will generate a warning that the TextToSpeechPrompt value will be ignored.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Get-CsAnnouncement | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "Help Desk Announcement"} | Set-CsAnnouncement -TextToSpeechPrompt $Null
```

In Example 2, the TextToSpeechPrompt property for the announcement Help Desk Announcement is set to a null value; this effectively erases the property value.
To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsAnnouncement` cmdlet to return a collection of all the announcements currently available.
This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which selects the announcement where the Name is equal to (-eq) "Help Desk Announcement".
This announcement is then piped to the `Set-CsAnnouncement` cmdlet, which sets the TextToSpeechPrompt property to a null value ($Null).


### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------
```
Get-CsAnnouncement | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "Help Desk Announcement"} | Set-CsAnnouncement -TargetUri "sip:kmyer@litwareinc.com;opaque=app:voicemail"
```

This example updates the TargetUri for the Announcement with the name Help Desk Announcement.
The command first uses the `Get-CsAnnouncement` cmdlet to return a collection of all the announcements currently available.
This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which selects the announcement where the Name is equal to (-eq) "Help Desk Announcement".
This announcement is then piped to the `Set-CsAnnouncement` cmdlet, which sets the TargetUri property to a voice mail location (sip:kmyer@litwareinc.com;opaque=app:voicemail).


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
A unique identifier for the Announcement.
This value will always be in the format \<serviceID\>/\<GUID\>, where serviceID is the Identity of the Application Server running the Announcement service and GUID is a globally unique identifier associated with these announcement settings.
For example: ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com/bef5fa3b-3c97-4af0-abe7-611deee7616c.

Because GUIDs can be difficult to enter correctly at the command line, you'll most likely retrieve announcements by using the `Get-CsAnnouncement` cmdlet and pipe them to the `Set-CsAnnouncement` cmdlet for modification.
(For details, see the Examples section.)
