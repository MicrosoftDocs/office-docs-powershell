# New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a new voice routing policy.
Voice routing policies manage PSTN usages for users of hybrid voice.
Hybrid voice enables users homed on Skype for Business Online to take advantage of the Enterprise Voice capabilities available in an on-premises installation of Skype for Business Server.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.


## SYNTAX

```
New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Confirm] [-Description <String>] [-Force] [-InMemory]
 [-Name <String>] [-PstnUsages <PSListModifier>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Voice routing policies are used in "hybrid" scenarios: when some of your users are homed on the on-premises version of Skype for Business Server and other users are homed on Skype for Business Online.
Assigning your Skype for Business Online users a voice routing policy enables those users to receive and to place phones calls to the public switched telephone network by using your on-premises SIP trunks.

Note that simply assigning a user a voice routing policy will not enable them to make PSTN calls via Skype for Business Online.
Among other things, you will also need to enable those users for Enterprise Voice and will need to assign them an appropriate voice policy and dial plan.

Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -Name "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -PstnUsages "Long Distance"
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new per-user voice routing policy with the Identity RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy.
This policy is assigned a single PSTN usage: Long Distance.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
New-CsVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -Name "RedmondVoiceRoutingPolicy" -PstnUsages "Long Distance", "Local", "Internal"
```

Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the new policy is assigned three PSTN usages: Long Distance; Local; Internal.
Multiple usages can be assigned simply by separating each usage using a comma.
