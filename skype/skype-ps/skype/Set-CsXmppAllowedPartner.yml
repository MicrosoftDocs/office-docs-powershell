### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Modifies an existing XMPP allowed partner.
  The extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open-standard communications protocol for exchanging messages using XML.
  An allowed partner is an IM and presence provider whose users are allowed to exchange instant messages and presence information with your Skype for Business Server users.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.
module: SkypeForBusiness

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsXmppAllowedPartner -Identity "contoso.com" -SupportDialbackNegotiation $False
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 disables dialback negotiation for the XMPP allowed partner contoso.com.
    This is done by including the SupportDialbackNegotiation parameter and setting the parameter value to False ($False).
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsXmppAllowedPartner | Set-CsXmppAllowedPartner -SaslNegotiation "Required"
  description: |-
    In the preceding example, Simple Authentication and Security Layer negotiation is enabled (and required) for all the XMPP allowed partners in the organization.
    To carry out this task, the command first uses the `Get-CsXmppAllowedPartner` cmdlet to return a collection of all the XMPP allowed partners.
    That collection is then piped to the `Set-CsXmppAllowedPartner` cmdlet, which sets the value of the SaslNegotiation property for each partner in the collection to Required.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsXmppAllowedPartner -Identity "contoso.com" -AdditionalDomains @{Add="na.contoso.com"}
  description: |-
    In Example 3, a new child domain - na.contoso.com - is added to the XMPP allowed partner contoso.com.
    To do this, the AdditionalDomains parameter is included, along with the syntax @{Add="na.contoso.com"}.
    That syntax adds na.contoso.com to any other domains currently found in the AdditionalDomains property.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsXmppAllowedPartner -Identity "contoso.com" -AdditionalDomains @{Remove="europe.contoso.com"}
  description: |-
    Example 4 removes the domain europe.contoso.com from the collection of additional domains assigned to the XMPP allowed partner contoso.com.
    To remove this domain, the AdditionalDomains parameter is included along with the parameter value @{Remove="europe.contoso.com"}.
    That syntax removes Europe.contoso.com from the AdditionalDomains property without affecting any other domains that might also be stored in AdditionalDomains.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 5 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsXmppAllowedPartner -Identity "contoso.com" -AdditionalDomains $Null
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 5 removes child domain support for the XMPP allowed partner contoso.com.
    This is done by including the AdditionalDomains parameter and the parameter value $Null; that deletes any domains currently included in the AdditionalDomains property.

  name: SaslNegotiation
  description: |+
    Indicates support for the Simple Authentication and Security Layer protocol, a protocol used for server authentication.

    Allowed values are:

    * Required (SASL negotiation must be supported)
    * Optional (SASL will be used
    * NotSupported (SASL negotiation will not be supported) if available)

    The default value is Required.

  name: SupportDialbackNegotiation
  description: |+
    Indicates whether dialback negotiation will be supported.
    With dialback negotiation, when Server A contacts Server B communication is not immediately established.
    Instead, Server B first attempts to verify the identity if Server A by contacting the authoritative DNS server for the domain that Server A claims to be from.

    Note that dialback negotiation is not as secure as SASL or TLS.
    Instead, it is primarily used in situations where certificates cannot be used to verify a server's identity.

    The default value is True.

  The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a standard communications protocol (based on XML) used for sending messages across the Internet.
  XMPP was originally named Jabber and is supported by a number of Internet messaging and communication applications, including Google Talk and Facebook Chat.

  In order for your users to be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with users on an XMPP network, that network must be configured as an XMPP allowed partner.
  (You must also assign your users an external access policy that allows XMPP access.) By design, your users will be allowed to communicate with users on any XMPP network that is listed on the allowed partners list.
  If you do not want users communicating with users from a given network then you must delete that network from the allowed partners list.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: To edit the property values for an existing XMPP allowed partner using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click External User Access, click XMPP Federated Partners and then double-click the partner to be modified.
