# Remove-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Removes the specified collection of User Replicator configuration settings.
The User Replicator periodically retrieves up-to-date user account information from Active Directory and then synchronizes the new information with the current user data stored by Skype for Business Server.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Although Skype for Business Server maintains its own database of user accounts and user account data, Skype for Business Server still relies on Active Directory as the ultimate source for user information.
For example, when a new Active Directory user account is created, you must supply basic information about the user account (such as the Active Directory display name).
However, when a user is enabled for Skype for Business Server you do not need to specify a new display name.
That's because Skype for Business Server uses the display name already stored in Active Directory.

Of course, user account information, including the Active Directory display name, is subject to change over time.
For example, a user who gets married might change her last name and, in turn, need to change her display name as well.
In order to ensure that the Skype for Business Server database and Active Directory remain in synch, Skype for Business Server must periodically connect to Active Directory, retrieve the latest user account updates and then modify the Skype for Business Server user database accordingly.
This synchronization between Active Directory and Skype for Business Server is carried out by the User Replicator.

When you install Skype for Business Server global set of User Replicator configuration settings is created for you.
By default, these settings are used to manage the User Replicator on an organization-wide basis.
Management of the User Replicator consists of identifying the domains that Skype for Business Server needs to synch with and indicating how often the User Replicator checks Active Directory for user account updates.
By default, the User Replicator discovers and synchs with all available domains.
However, by using the AdDomainNamingContextList property you can restrict synchronization to a specific set of domains: the domains that appear in the AdDomainNamingContextList property.

You can also create additional collections at the service scope, but only if you are working with Skype for Business Online.

If your needs change, you can use the `Remove-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration` cmdlet to remove the custom settings created at the service scope.
Note that you can also run this cmdlet against the global configuration settings.
In that case, however, the global settings will not be removed.
Instead, all the properties within the global collection will be reset to their default values.
In the case of the User Replicator, that means erasing the list of domains that must be synchronized with (thus causing the replicator to synch with all discoverable domains) and setting the replication interval cycle to 1 minute.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Remove-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity global
```

Example 1 resets the global User Replicator configuration settings.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier of the User Replicator configuration settings to be removed.
To remove settings at the service scope, use syntax similar to this:

`-Identity "service:Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"`

Note that you can only remove service-scoped setting if you are using Skype for Business Online.
To reset the global settings, use this syntax:

`-Identity global`

You cannot use wildcards when specifying an Identity.
