  name: SkipRoutingGroup
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more routing groups by GUID to skip during startup.
    Use this parameter if one or more of the routing groups are having problems getting placed on servers.

    Note that some of the users included in the skipped routing groups might not be able to sign in, or will have limited functionality.

    For example, to specify a single routing group use the following syntax: `-SkipRoutingGroup "bef5fa3b-3c97-4af0-abe7-611deee7616c"`.
    To specify more than one routing group use the syntax: `-SkipRoutingGroup "bef5fa3b-3c97-4af0-abe7-611deee7616c","cid4de2-3d86-3be9-bcf8-700fesi3923q"`.

  name: SkipServer
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more servers to skip during startup.
    Use this parameter if one or more of the front end servers cannot be started.
    Note that there is a minimum number of servers required for the pool to be functional.
    The cmdlet will check for those conditions while trying to implement this parameter.

    For example, to specify a single server use the following syntax: `-SkipServer "AtlServerOne.litwareinc.com"`.
    To specify more than one server use the syntax: `-SkipServer "AtlServerOne.litwareinc.com","AtlServerTwo.litwareinc.com"`
