# New-CsUCPhoneConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a new collection of settings used to manage UC phone configuration settings.
These settings enable you to configure such things as the required security mode and to specify whether or not the phone should automatically be locked after a specified period of inactivity.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

## DESCRIPTION
UC phones represent the merging of the telephone and Skype for Business Server.
UC phones use special hardware (that is, a Skype for Business-compatible telephone) that can function as a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone.
In addition, this hardware can also act as a Skype for Business-like endpoint: you can set your current status; check the status of your Skype for Business contacts; search for new contacts and carry out many of the other activities you are used to doing with Skype for Business.

Skype for Business Server ships with a number of cmdlets that enable you to manage your UC phones; for example, you can control such things as the minimum length of the personal identification number (PIN) used to log on to the phone and whether or not the phone will automatically lock itself after a specified period of inactivity.

Unified communications (UC) phone configuration settings can be applied at either the global scope or at the site scope.
(Settings applied at the site scope take precedence over settings applied at the global scope.) When you first install Skype for Business Server, a single set of UC phone configuration settings is created and applied at the global scope.
However, at any time after that you can use the `New-CsUCPhoneConfiguration` cmdlet to create a collection of settings that are applied at the site scope.
This lets you tailor UC phone management to the unique needs of each individual site.

The `New-CsUCPhoneConfiguration` cmdlet enables you to create new UC phone settings at the site scope.
Note that there can only be one collection of settings per site.
For example, suppose you try to create a collection of settings that has the Identity site:Redmond, but the Redmond site already has a set of UC phone settings assigned to it.
In that case, your command will fail.
Instead, you must do one of two things: either remove the existing settings and then use the `New-CsUCPhoneConfiguration` cmdlet to create a new collection of settings; or simply use the `Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration` cmdlet to modify the existing settings.

You cannot create a new collection of settings at the global scope.
The only thing you can do at the global scope is use the `Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration` cmdlet to modify the existing settings.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
New-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -CalendarPollInterval "00:10:00" -LoggingLevel "Medium"
```

Example 1 creates a new collection of UC phone settings for the Redmond site.
In this example, two optional parameters are included along with the required parameter Identity: CalendarPollInterval, which sets the calendar polling time to every 10 minutes (00 hours: 10 minutes: 00 seconds); and LoggingLevel, which sets the UC phone logging level to Medium.
As soon as this command completes, the new settings will be applied to the Redmond site and users in that site will have their UC phones governed by the new settings.
Note that this command will fail if the Redmond site already has a collection of UC phone settings.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
$x = New-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -InMemory

$x.CalendarPollInterval = "00:10:00"

$x.LoggingLevel = "Medium"

Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration -Instance $x
```

Example 2 demonstrates the use of the InMemory parameter; this parameter enables you to create a new set of UC phone settings that exists in memory only.
(These settings are stored in the variable $x.) After this virtual collection has been created, you can modify the in-memory-only settings using commands similar to those shown in lines 2 and 3 of the example: in line 2, the CalendarPollInterval property is set the 10 minutes (00 hours: 10 minutes: 00 seconds) and in line 3 the LoggingLevel property is set to Medium.

After you have finished modifying the property values, you can then use the `Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration` cmdlet to turn the virtual settings stored in $x into an actual collection of settings applied to the Redmond site.
Note that, with the use of the InMemory parameter, the settings are not actually applied until you call the `Set-CsUCPhoneConfiguration` cmdlet.
If you do not call this cmdlet, your virtual settings will disappear when you end your Windows PowerShell session or when you delete the variable $x.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Represents the unique identifier to be assigned to the new collection of UC phone configuration settings.
Because you can only create new collections at the site scope, the Identity will always be the prefix "site:" followed by the site name; for example "site:Redmond".
