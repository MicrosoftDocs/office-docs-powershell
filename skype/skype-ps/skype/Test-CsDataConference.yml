    The command shown in Example 1 verifies that a data conference can be conducted on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    This command assumes that you have configured a pair of test users for the specified pool.
    If no such test users exist, the command will fail.

  code: |-
    $credential1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"

    $credential2 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

    Test-CsDataConference -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -SenderSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $credential1 -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -ReceiverCredential $credential2
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 test the ability of a pair of users (litwareinc\pilar and litwareinc\kenmyer) to log on to Skype for Business Server and then conduct an data conference.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell command-line interface credential object containing the name and password of the user Pilar Ackerman.
    (Because the logon name, litwareinc\pilar, has been included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box only requires the administrator to enter the password for the Pilar Ackerman account.) The resulting credential object is then stored in a variable named $cred1.
    The second command does the same thing, this time returning a credential object for the Ken Myer account.

    With the credential objects in hand, the third command determines whether or not these two users can log on to Skype for Business Server and conduct a data conference.
    To carry out this task, the `Test-CsDataConference` cmdlet is called, along with the following parameters: TargetFqdn (the FQDN of the Registrar pool); SenderSipAddress (the SIP address for the first test user); SenderCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for this same user); ReceiverSipAddress (the SIP address for the other test user); and ReceiverCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for the other test user).

    `-OutLoggerVariable TestOutput`

    Note: Do not prepend a $ character when specifying the variable name.

    To save the information stored in the logger variable to an HTML file, use a command similar to this:

    `$TestOutput.ToHTML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.html`

uid: SkypeForBusiness.Test-CsDataConference

description: |-
  In Skype for Business Server, a data conference is any conference where collaborative activities such as whiteboarding or annotations are used.
  The `Test-CsDataConference` cmdlet enables you to verify that a pair of users are able to take part in a data conference.

  The ability to conduct a data conference depends on the conferencing policy that has been assigned to the user who organized the conference (in the case of the `Test-CsDataConference` cmdlet, that is the "sender").
  If the organizer is not allowed to include collaborative activities in his or her meeting (for example, if his or her conferencing policy has the EnableDataCollaboration property set to False) then the `Test-CsDataConference` cmdlet will fail.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Test-CsDataConference` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
