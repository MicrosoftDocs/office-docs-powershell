# Stop-CsClsLogging

## SYNOPSIS
Stops the specified scenario centralized logging service scenario.
Centralized logging provides a way for administrators to simultaneously enable or disable Skype for Business Server tracing on multiple computers.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.


## SYNTAX

```
Stop-CsClsLogging -Scenario <String> [-AsXml] [-Computers <String[]>] [-Pools <String[]>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The centralized logging service (which replaces the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides a way for administrators to manage logging and tracing for all computers and pools running Skype for Business Server.
Centralized logging enables administrators to stop, start and configure logging for one or more pools and computers by using a single command; for example, you can use one command to enable Address Book service logging on all your Address Book servers.
This differs from the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools, which had to be individually managed (including individually stopped and started) on each server.
In addition, the centralized logging service also provides a way for administrators to search trace logs from the command, using the Windows PowerShell command-line interface and the `Search-CsClsLogging` cmdlet.

Centralized logging is built around a series of predefined scenarios that offer a more finely-targeted approach to logging than offered in previous versions of Skype for Business Server.
These scenarios predetermine the server components and logging for you; as a result, an administrator enabling the RGS scenario can be confident that he or she will only log information relevant to the Response Group service and not to, say, the audio conferencing provider service.

It is also possible to define custom scenarios by using the `New-CsClsScenario` cmdlet.

The `Start-CsClsLogging` cmdlet provides a way for administrators to begin logging a specified scenario on a computer or set of computers.
By default, that logging operation will continue to run until the Duration time limit has expired.
However, administrators can manually stop a logging operation at any time by using the `Stop-CsClsLogging` cmdlet.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Stop-CsClsLogging -Scenario "cps"
```

The command shown in Example 1 stops the CPS logging scenario on all the servers in the topology.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Stop-CsClsLogging -Scenario "cps" -Pools "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

In Example 2, CPS logging scenario is stopped on all the servers in the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.


## PARAMETERS

### -Scenario
Name of the centralized logging scenario to be stopped.
Available scenarios (and their names) names can be returned by using this command:

`Get-CsClsScenario | Select-Object Name`

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AsXml
When specified, information is returned using XML.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Computers
Enables administrators to stop logging on a specified server or set of servers.
To stop logging on a single server, specify the fully qualified domain name of that server.
For example:

`-Computers "atl-server-001.litwareinc.com"`

Multiple servers can be specified by separating the computer FQDNs using commas:

`-Computers "atl-server-001.litwareinc.com","red-server-002.litwareinc.com"`

If you do not include the Computers parameter or the Pools parameter, the `Stop-CsClsLogging` cmdlet will run the command against all pools in the topology.


```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Pools
Enables administrators to stop logging on each server in a pool.
To stop logging in a pool, specify the fully qualified domain name of that pool.
For example:

`-Pools "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"`

Multiple pools can be specified by separating the pool FQDNs using commas:

`-Pools "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com","red-cs-002.litwareinc.com"`

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

###  
None.
The `Stop-CsClsLogging` cmdlet does not accept pipelined input.

## OUTPUTS

###  
String value or XML output.
The `Stop-CsClsLogging` cmdlet does not return objects.
