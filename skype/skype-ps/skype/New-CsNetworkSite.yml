examples:
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsNetworkSite -Identity Vancouver -NetworkRegionID NorthAmerica
  description: |-
    In this example a new network site named Vancouver is created.
    The site name is specified as the value for the Identity parameter.
    A value is also specified for the NetworkRegionID parameter, which associates the site with the region (in this example NorthAmerica).
    A BypassID value will be automatically generated.
    Manually setting a value for BypassID is not recommended.

    Notice that the command in this example did not include the BWPolicyProfileID parameter.
    Unless (or until) a value is added to this site later using the Set-CsNetworkSite cmdlet, it will have no bandwidth limitations for media connections.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsNetworkSite -Identity Paris -NetworkRegionID EMEA -BWPolicyProfileID LowBWLimits
  description: |-
    In Example 2 we create a new network site named Paris.
    The site name is specified as the value for the Identity parameter.
    As in Example 1 we also specify a value for the NetworkRegionID, this time the region EMEA.
    Once again we are following the recommended path by allowing the cmdlet to generate the BypassID.
    Unlike Example 1, this example also specifies a value for the BWPolicyProfileID parameter: LowBWLimits.
    The policies associated with that profile will be used for this site.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BWPolicyProfileID
  description: |+
    The Identity of the bandwidth policy profile that will define the bandwidth limitations for this site.
    You can retrieve a list of available profiles by calling the Get-CsNetworkBandwidthPolicyProfile cmdlet.

    If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also specify a value for the NetworkRegionID parameter.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BypassID
  description: |+
    A globally unique identifier (GUID).
    This GUID is used to map network sites to media bypass settings within a CAC or E9-1-1 network configuration.
    (Use this BypassID value in the call to the New-CsNetworkMediaBypassConfiguration cmdlet.)

    If you do not specify a value for this parameter, a value will be automatically generated, but only if you supply a value for the NetworkRegionID parameter.
    If you do not supply a NetworkRegionID parameter, no BypassID will be generated.
    You also cannot explicitly supply a value for the BypassID parameter without also supplying a value for the NetworkRegionID parameter.

    If you explicitly specify a value, it must be in the format of a GUID (for example, 3b24a047-dce6-48b2-9f20-9fbff17ed62a).
    Auto-generation is recommended.
    If you manually enter a value, you will receive a confirmation prompt to verify that you don't want to auto-generate the value.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    A unique identifier for the newly created network site.
    Sites are created only at the global scope, so this identifier does not need to specify a scope.
    Instead, it contains a string that is unique among all network sites within the Skype for Business Server 2015 deployment.

    Creates an object reference without actually committing the object as a permanent change.
    If you assign the output of this cmdlet called with this parameter to a variable, you can make changes to the properties of the object reference and then commit those changes by calling this cmdlet's matching Set-\<cmdlet\>.

  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Identity of the network region that this site is associated with.
    This parameter must contain a value if you want to provide a BypassID (either through auto-generation or manually), or if the EnableBandwidthPolicyCheck property of the network configuration is True.
    You can retrieve the network configuration settings by calling the Get-CsNetworkConfiguration cmdlet.

    Per-user voice routing policy to be assigned to the site.
    For example:

    `-VoiceRoutingPolicy "RedmondVoiceRouting"`

    Note that you must specify a per-user policy; global and/or site policies cannot be assigned to a site using the VoiceRoutingPolicy parameter.

    This parameter was introduced in the February, 2013 release of Lync Server 2013.

description: |-
  Network sites are the offices or locations configured within each region of a CAC or E9-1-1 deployment.
  This cmdlet creates a new site and optionally associates it with a region.
  For example, a network region for North America might be associated with networks sites such as Chicago, Redmond, and Vancouver.
  A CAC network site must be created for every site within an organization, even if that site has no bandwidth limitations.
