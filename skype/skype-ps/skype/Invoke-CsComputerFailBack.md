# Invoke-CsComputerFailBack

## SYNOPSIS
Use the Invoke-CsComputerFailBack to flag a server as available for load balancing in a Skype for Business Server pool.
To successfully run this cmdlet you need to run it using an account that has administrator privileges on each server in the source and target pools.

## SYNTAX

```
Invoke-CsComputerFailBack [[-ComputerName] <String>] [-Confirm] [-NoStart] [-Report <String>]
 [-WaitTime <TimeSpan>] [-WhatIf] [-SkipFabricHealthCheck] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Invoke-CsComputerFailBack cmdlet functionality is not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.

To return a list of all the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles a cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt.

`Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -Match "\<DesiredCmdletName\>"}`

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- (Skype for Business Server 2015)
```

Invoke-CsComputerFailBack -ComputerName "atl-mcs-001.litwareinc.com" -NoStart
```

This example marks the computer "atl-mcs-001.litwareinc.com" as available to the pool and enables the services, but does not start them.


## PARAMETERS

### -ComputerName
Specifies the computer name to fail back.
The computer should be referenced by using its fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
For example, `-ComputerName "atl-mcs-001.litwareinc.com".`
The computer name used during failback must be the same name used during failover.

### -NoStart
If the NoStart parameter is specified, the Skype for Business server is added back into the pool and marked as available, but all the Skype for Business services are not started.

By default, reports are written to the AppData\Local\Temp folder in your user profile.
