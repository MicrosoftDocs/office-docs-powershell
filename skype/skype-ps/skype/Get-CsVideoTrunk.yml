  Video trunks are SIP trunks between the Video Interop Server and a Video Gateway that are used to setup video calls between 3rd party video teleconferencing systems (VTCs) connected to the Video Gateway and Skype conferences or Skype endpoints.

  Trunk information is read-only.
  You cannot create, delete or modify trunks by using Windows PowerShell.
  Those operations can only be carried out by using Skype for Business Server Topology Builder.

  To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles that can run this cmdlet (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt.

  `Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -Match "Get-CsVideoTrunk"}`
