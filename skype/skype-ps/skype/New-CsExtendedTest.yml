### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a PSTN or an Audio Conferencing Provider test that can then be assigned to a watcher node configuration.
  Watcher nodes are computers that periodically use Microsoft System Center Operations Manager and Skype for Business Server synthetic transactions to verify that Skype for Business Server components are working as expected.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.

    The commands shown in Example 1 create a new extended test (with the TestType of PSTN), then adds that extended test to a new watcher node for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    In the first command in the example, the New-CsExtendedTest cmdlet is used to create an extended test named PSTN Test; this test includes the test users sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com and sip:pilar@litwareinc.com.
    (Note that these two test users must have already been configured using the Set-CsTestUserCredential cmdlet.) The resulting extended test object is then stored in a variable named $x.

    In the second command, the new extended test is added to the newly-created watcher node for atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    This is done by using the ExtendedTests parameter and the syntax @{Add=$x}.

  If you are using Microsoft System Center Operations Manager to monitor Skype for Business Server then you have the option of setting up "watcher nodes": computers that periodically, and automatically, run synthetic transactions in order to verify that Skype for Business Server is working as expected.
  Watcher nodes are assigned to pools, and are managed using the CsWatcherNodeConfiguration cmdlets.
  Note that you do not need to install watcher nodes if you are using System Center Operations Manager.
  You can still monitor your system without using watcher nodes; the only difference is that any synthetic transactions you want to run will need to be invoked manually rather than automatically invoked by Operations Manager.

  When you configure a watcher node, you have the option of adding a PSTN or an Audio Conferencing Provider test as an "extended test"; these extended tests can be used instead of or in addition to the standard set of tests run by a watcher node computer.
  Extended tests must be created using the New-CsExtendedTest cmdlet and then added to the appropriate watcher node.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the New-CsExtendedTest cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
