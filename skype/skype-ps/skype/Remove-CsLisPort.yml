### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Removes an association between a Location Information Server (LIS) port and a location.
  This association is used in an Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) Enterprise Voice implementation to notify an emergency services operator of the caller's location.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.
module: SkypeForBusiness

  code: |-
    Remove-CsLisPort -ChassisID 99-99-99-99-99-99 -PortID 4200 -PortIDSubType 1
  description: |-
    Example 1 removes the LIS port with the MAC address (ChassisID) 99-99-99-99-99-99, the PortID 4200 and the PortIDSubType 1.
    (Note that a value of 1 for PortIDSubType translates into a value of InterfaceAlias.
    This parameter and value could also have been entered like this: `-PortIDSubType InterfaceAlias`)

    If this port was associated with a location, that location will not be removed, only the port will be removed from the location mapping.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsLisPort | Where-Object {$_.HouseNumber -eq ""} | Remove-CsLisPort
  description: |-
    This example removes all port locations that do not have a house number.
    The example begins with a call to the `Get-CsLisPort` cmdlet, which returns a collection of all LIS ports.
    This collection is piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which finds the items in that collection that have a HouseNumber property that is empty; in other words, a HouseNumber that is equal to (-eq) an empty string ("").
    Finally, we pipe this collection of port locations that don't have house numbers to the `Remove-CsLisPort` cmdlet, which removes everything in that collection.

    Note that, as in example 1, no locations are removed from the location configuration database, only the ports that reference those locations are removed.
    In this case that means there will be invalid locations (they're invalid because HouseNumber is a required property for a location) in the location database that should also be removed.
    You can remove locations by calling the `Remove-CsLisLocation` cmdlet.

description: |-
  Enhanced 9-1-1 allows an emergency operator to identify the location of a caller without having to ask the caller for that information.
  In the case where a caller is calling from a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connection, that information must be extracted based on various connection factors.
  The VoIP administrator must configure a location map (called a wiremap) that will determine a caller's location.
  This cmdlet removes an association between a physical location and a port through which calls will be routed by removing the port from the location configuration database.

  Removing a port location will not remove the actual location of the port; it removes only the port.
  To remove the location, call the `Remove-CsLisLocation` cmdlet.
  Removing the port will also not remove the switch with the given ChassisID; to remove the switch, call the `Remove-CsLisSwitch` cmdlet.

  If you attempt to remove a port that does not exist, no action will be taken and you will not receive an error or a warning message.
