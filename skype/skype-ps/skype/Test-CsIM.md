## DESCRIPTION
The `Test-CsIM` cmdlet is an example of a Skype for Business Server "synthetic transaction." Synthetic transactions are used in Skype for Business Server to verify that users are able to successfully complete common tasks such as logging on to the system, exchanging instant messages, or making calls to a phone located on the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
These tests can be conducted manually by an administrator, or they can be automatically run by an application such as Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (formerly Microsoft Operations Manager).

Synthetic transactions are typically conducted in two different ways.
Many administrators will use the `CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration` cmdlets to set up test users for each of their Registrar pools.
These test users are a pair of users who have been preconfigured for use with synthetic transactions.
(Typically these are test accounts and not accounts that belong to actual users.) With test users configured for a pool, administrators can simply run a synthetic transaction against that pool without having to specify the identities of (and supply the credentials for) the user accounts involved in the test.

Alternatively, administrators can run a synthetic transaction using actual user accounts.
For example, if two users are unable to exchange instant messages, an administrator can run a synthetic transaction using the two user accounts in question (as opposed to a pair of test accounts) to try to diagnose and resolve the problem.
If you decide to conduct a synthetic transaction using actual user accounts you will need to supply credentials for each user.

The `Test-CsIM` cmdlet starts off by trying to log a pair of test users on to Skype for Business Server.
Assuming the two logons are successful, the cmdlet then initiates an instant messaging (IM) session between the two test users.
(User 1 invites User 2 to an IM session, and User 2 accepts the invitation.) After verifying that messages can be exchanged between the two users, the `Test-CsIM` cmdlet then ends the IM session and logs both users off of the system.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Test-CsIm -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
```

Example 1 checks to see if a pair of preconfigured test users can log on to the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com and then exchange instant messages.
This command will work only if test users have been defined for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
If they have, then the command will determine whether the two users can log on to the system and, if so, can then exchange instant messages.
I

If test users have not been defined, then the command will fail because it will not know which users to employ when doing the test.
If you have not defined a Registrar for a pool, then you must include the SenderSipAddress and ReceiverSipAddress parameters, in addition to the corresponding credentials for the users involved in the IM session.
The`Test-CsIM` cmdlet will then conduct its checks by using the two specified users.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
$cred1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"

$cred2 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

Test-CsIm -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -SenderSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $cred1 -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -ReceiverCredential $cred2
```

The commands shown in Example 2 test the ability of a pair of users (litwareinc\pilar and litwareinc\kenmyer) to log on to Skype for Business Server and then exchange instant messages.
To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell credential object containing the name and password of the user Pilar Ackerman.
(Because the logon name, litwareinc\pilar, has been included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box will only require the administrator to enter the password for the Pilar Ackerman account.) The resulting credentials object is then stored in a variable named $cred1.
The second command does the same thing, this time returning a credential object for the Ken Myer account.

With the two credential objects in hand, the third command in the example determines whether or not the two users can log on to Skype for Business Server and then exchange instant messages.
To do this, the `Test-CsIM` cmdlet is called along with the following parameters: TargetFqdn (the FQDN of the Registrar pool); SenderSipAddress (the SIP address for the first test user); SenderCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for this user); -ReceiverSipAddress (the SIP address for the other test user); and ReceiverCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for the other user).


## PARAMETERS

### -ReceiverCredential
User credential object for the first of the two user accounts to be tested.
The value passed to ReceiverCredential should be an object reference obtained by using the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.
For example, this code returns a credentials object for the user litwareinc\pilar and stores that object in a variable named $y:

`$y = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"`

You need to supply the user password when running this command.

The receiver credential is not required if you are running the test under the health monitoring configuration settings for the pool.
