### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a new Response Group queue.
  With the Response Group application, phone calls are put in a queue and callers are placed on hold until a Response Group agent is available to answer that call.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

  code: |-
    $x = New-CsRgsCallAction -Action TransferToVoicemailUri -Uri "sip:+14255551298@litwareinc.com"

    New-CsRgsQueue -Parent service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -Name "Help Desk" -OverflowCandidate "OldestCall" -OverflowAction $x -OverflowThreshold 25
  description: |-
    Example 1 creates a new Response Group queue for the service ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    The first command in the example uses the New-CsRgsCallAction cmdlet to create a call action for the queue; in this example, any time the overflow threshold is exceeded calls will automatically be transferred to voice mail.
    This is configured by setting the Action parameter to TransferToVoicemailUri and the URI property to the voice mail SIP URI "sip:+14255551298@litwareinc.com".

    After the call action has been configured (and stored in the variable $x), New-CsRgsQueue is then used to create a new queue named Help Desk.
    In addition to specifying the OverflowAction, this command also configures values for the OverflowCandidate and OverflowThreshold properties.

  name: AgentGroupIDList
  description: |+
    Identity of the Response Group agent groups to be added to the queue.
    The agent group Identities can be retrieved using the Get-CsRgsAgentGroup cmdlet.
    For details, see the Examples section in this topic.

    If a call is routed to a queue that has no agent groups assigned to it (or has only been assigned agent groups that do not have any agents) then that call will automatically be disconnected.

  When someone calls a phone number associated with the Response Group application, one of two things typically happens: either the call is transferred to a question that the caller must answer in order to continue (for example, "Press 1 for hardware support; press 2 for software support") or the call is placed in a queue until an agent is available to answer the call.

  Instead of having a single queue for all phone calls, the Response Group application enables you to create multiple queues that can be associated with different workflows and different Response Group agent groups.
  In turn, this means queues can respond differently to events such as a designated number of calls being simultaneously held in the queue, or to callers that have been on hold for a specified amount of time.

  The New-CsRgsQueue cmdlet provides an easy way for administrators to create new Response Group queues.
