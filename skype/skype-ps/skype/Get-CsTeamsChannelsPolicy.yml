  description: |+
    Specify the unique name of a policy you would like to retrieve. Use one of the following values:

    - `Global`
    - The name of a custom policy you've created. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks ("). Note that the Identity value shows as `Tag:<Name>`, but the `<Name>` value also works.
    - `Default`: This is a template that's used to populate the default property values when you create a new policy or to reset the property values in the global policy in case you delete it. Note that the Identity value shows as `Tag:Default`, but the `Default` value also works.
