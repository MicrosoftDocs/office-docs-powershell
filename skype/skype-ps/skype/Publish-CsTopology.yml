    Publish-CsTopology -FileName "C:\Topologies\Topology.xml"
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 1 retrieve and then republish the current topology.
    To carry out these tasks, the first command in the example uses the `Get-CsTopology` cmdlet and the AsXml parameter to retrieve the current topology; the Windows PowerShell redirection symbol \> is then used to save the retrieved data to a file named C:\Topologies\Topology.xml.
    (Note, too, that the ToString method is used to convert the retrieved topology to a string value.) The second command in the example then uses the `Publish-CsTopology` cmdlet to republish the newly retrieved topology.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BackupFileName
  description: |+
    Full path to the backup file automatically created when you run the `Publish-CsTopology` cmdlet.
    If this parameter is not specified, then the `Publish-CsTopology` cmdlet will create a backup file in your Temp folder (%temp%) similar to this: Publish-CsTopology-Backup-\[2010_10_01\]\[08_30_00\].
    In that file name, 2010_10_01 represents the date that publication took place: year (2010), month (10) and day (01).
    In addition, 08_30_00 represents the time of day when publication took place: hour (08), minutes (30) and seconds (00).

description: |-
  After you have installed Skype for Business Server, you will eventually need to make changes to the Skype for Business Server infrastructure; for example, you might need to add a new site, delete an existing Registrar pool, or add an additional Archiving Server.
  These infrastructure changes must be made by using Topology Builder.
  After you have made the changes in Topology Builder, you can then publish and enable those changes using that same tool.
  These latter two steps are very important: although you can make as many modifications as you want using the Topology Builder, those modifications do not actually take effect and your Skype for Business Server infrastructure will not actually change, until the modifications have been published and the new topology has been enabled.

  When changes are published, the new information (for example, a new site or a new server role) is written to the Central Management store.
  However, these new (or the newly modified) objects do not immediately join your topology; that occurs only when the updated topology has been enabled.
  If you select the Publish option in Topology Builder both of these steps will take place: the changes will be published (written to the Central Management store) and then the new topology will be enabled.

  The `Publish-CsTopology` cmdlet is no longer the recommended way to publish topologies created by using Topology Builder; instead, publishing should be done within Topology Builder, using the steps outlined in the previous paragraph.
  This is because Topology Builder now uses the Topology Builder XML file format (.tbxml); this file format cannot be published by using the `Publish-CsTopology` cmdlet.
  The only thing you can do with the `Publish-CsTopology` cmdlet is republish a topology retrieved by using the `Get-CsTopology` cmdlet.
  After publishing the topology in this manner, you will then need to reconfigure your simple URLs.
