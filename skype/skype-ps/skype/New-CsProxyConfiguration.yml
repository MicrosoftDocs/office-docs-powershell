  code: |-
    New-CsProxyConfiguration -Identity "service:EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com" -RequestServerCompression $True -MaxClientMessageBodySizeKb 256
  description: |-
    Example 1 creates a new collection of proxy configuration settings for the service EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com.
    These new settings use all the default proxy server property values except for two: RequestServerCompression, which is set to True; and MaxClientMessageBodySizeKb, which is set to 256.
    Note that this command will fail if proxy server settings have already been configured for the service EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $x = New-CsProxyConfiguration -Identity "service:EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com" -InMemory

    $x.RequestServerCompression = $True

    $x.MaxClientMessageBodySizeKb = 256

    Set-CsProxyConfiguration -Instance $x
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 demonstrate how you can create a collection of proxy server settings that initially exist only in memory.
    To do this, the first command calls the New-CsProxyConfiguration cmdlet along with two parameters: Identity (which specifies the Identity for the settings) and InMemory, which indicates that the new settings should be created in memory only.
    The resulting object is stored in the variable $x.

    After these virtual settings have been created, commands 2 and 3 are used to modify the values of the RequestServerCompression and MaxClientMessageBodySizeKb properties, respectively.
    Finally, command 4 is used to transform the virtual proxy server configuration settings into an actual collection of settings applied to the service EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com.
    This final command is mandatory.
    If you do not call the Set-CsProxyConfiguration cmdlet, no settings will be applied to EdgeServer:atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com and the virtual settings will disappear as soon as you end your Windows PowerShell session or delete the variable $x.

  description: |+
    Unique identifier for the proxy server configuration settings to be created.
    Proxy server configuration settings can only be created at the service scope, and only for the Edge Server and Registrar services.
    You cannot create settings at the global scope; likewise, you cannot create settings at the service scope if the service in question already hosts a collection of proxy server settings.
    For example, if the service Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com already hosts proxy server settings, then any command that attempts to create new settings for that service will fail.

    To specify the Identity for your new proxy server settings, use syntax similar to this:

    `-Identity "service:Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"`

  Skype for Business Server enables you to manage your proxy servers through proxy server configuration settings.
  These settings, which can be applied at both the global scope and the service scope (albeit for only the Edge Server and Registrar services) enable you to control such things as the authentication protocols that can be used by client endpoints and whether or not compression will be used on incoming and outgoing proxy server connections.
  When you install Skype for Business Server, a global collection of proxy server configuration settings is automatically created for you.
  As noted, you can also create additional collections at the service scope.
  These new collections are created by using the New-CsProxyConfiguration cmdlet.
