# Test-CsMcxPushNotification

## SYNOPSIS
Verifies that the push notification service is working.
The push notification service (Apple Push Notification Service and Microsoft Push Notification Service) provides a way to send notifications about events such as new instant messages or new voice mail to mobile devices like iPhones and Windows Phones, even if the Skype for Business application on those devices is currently suspended or running in the background.
This cmdlet was introduced in the cumulative update for Lync Server 2010: November 2011.



## SYNTAX

```
Test-CsMcxPushNotification [-AccessEdgeFqdn] <String> [-Certificate <X509Certificate2>] [-Force]
 [-OutLoggerVariable <String>] [-OutVerboseVariable <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Apple Push Notification Service and the Skype for Business Server Push Notification Service enable users running Skype for Business on their Apple iPhone or Windows Phone to receive notifications about Skype for Business events even when the application is suspended or running in the background.
For example, users can receive notice for events such as these:

- Invitations to a new instant messaging session or conference
- New instant messages
- New voice mail

Without the push notification service, users would receive these notices only when Skype for Business was in the foreground and serving as the active application.

The `Test-CsMcxPushNotification` cmdlet provides a way for administrators to verify that the push notification service is working.
When using this cmdlet, make sure that the AccessEdgeFqdn parameter points to the internal edge of the proxy server to which push notification traffic is directed.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Test-CsMcxPushNotification -AccessEdgeFqdn "atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com"
```

The command shown in Example 1 tests the push notification service accessed through the Edge server atl-edge-001.litwareinc.com.
The AccessEdgeFqdn must point to the internal edge of the proxy server to which push notification traffic is directed.
