# Test-CsVoiceUser

## SYNOPSIS
Identifies the route that a phone call from a given user would take to be completed based on voice rules, routes, and policies.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Test-CsVoiceUser -DialedNumber <PhoneNumber> -SipUri <UserIdParameter> [-Force] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
When a user makes a phone call, the route the call takes to reach its destination depends on the policies and dial plans assigned to that user.
Given a user's SIP address and a phone number, this cmdlet returns the number translated to E.164 format (based on the user's dial plan), the normalization rule that supplied that translation, the first route (based on route Priority) with a number pattern matching that phone number, and the phone usage that would link the voice policy of that user to the voice route.

This cmdlet can be used to determine whether a specific phone number will route and translate as expect based on user settings, and can help troubleshoot issues experienced by individual users.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Test-CsVoiceUser -DialedNumber "+14255559999" -SipUri "sip:kmyer@litwareinc.com" -Verbose
```

This example runs a voice user test against the user with the SIP address sip:kmyer@litwareinc.com.
The test is performed against the phone number provided by the DialedNumber parameter ("+14255559999").
If no matching rules or routes are identified this cmdlet returns a null value.
Notice that we've also included the Verbose parameter.
Verbose is a common Windows PowerShell parameter that will display additional information as the test is being conducted, such as which dial plan and voice policy are being loaded for the test.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsUser | ForEach-Object {$_.DisplayName; Test-CsVoiceUser -DialedNumber "+14255559999" -SipUri $_.SipAddress} | Format-List
```

This example does a voice routing test for all users enabled for Skype for Business Server.
The command starts with a call to the `Get-CsUser` cmdlet, which returns a collection of all users enabled for Skype for Business Server.
This example then pipes the collection of users to the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet.
This cmdlet will look at each individual user object and perform the actions we've specified within curly braces ({}).

The first action is to output the display name of the current user.
(The current user is represented by the $_ characters; thus the display name is in the DisplayName property of $_.) We now can see which user account we're testing.
Next we call the `Test-CsVoiceUser` cmdlet, passing it the DialedNumber ("+14255559999") and the SipUri of the current user.
In this example we're using the user's SIP address ($_.SipAddress).

Finally, because the output by default is in table format and can get cut off to fit the screen width, we pipe the test results to the `Format-List` cmdlet so we'll see each user's display name followed by one line for each output field.
