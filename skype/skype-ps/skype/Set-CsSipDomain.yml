examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsSipDomain -Identity fabrikam.com -IsDefault $True
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 makes the SIP domain fabrikam.com the default SIP domain; this is done by using the IsDefault parameter and the parameter value $True.
    When this command is run, Fabrikam.com will become the default domain and the domain which previously served as the default will be "demoted". That's because you can have only one default domain.

  name: IsDefault
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the domain is the default SIP domain, the domain used by Skype for Business Server any time a domain name is not explicitly stated.
    If set to True, the new domain will become the new default domain.
    You cannot set this value to False because that would leave you without a default SIP domain.

    If you change the default SIP domain you will need to restart the RTCCAA and RTCCAS services.

uid: SkypeForBusiness.Set-CsSipDomain
name: Set-CsSipDomain
description: |-
  In order to configure SIP addresses for your users (and thus enable them to use SIP-related software such as Skype for Business), you need two pieces of information: a user ID (for example, Ken.Myer) and a SIP domain (for example, litwareinc.com).
  The SIP domain used to construct a SIP address must be a domain located within your Active Directory forest that is authorized to send and receive SIP traffic.
  For example, suppose you have domains named litwareinc.com, fabrikam.com, and contoso.com, but only litwareinc.com has been identified as being a SIP domain.
  In that case, you cannot use a SIP address like sip:Ken.Myer@fabrikam.com or sip:Ken.Myer@contoso.com, at least not until fabrikam.com and contoso.com have been configured as valid SIP domains.
  That is something you can do by running the `New-CsSipDomain` cmdlet.

  You must always have one SIP domain configured as the default domain.
  The `Set-CsSipDomain` cmdlet provides a way for you to change your default SIP domain.
