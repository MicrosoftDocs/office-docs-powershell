- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsCallParkOrbit -Identity "Redmond CPO 1" -NumberRangeStart 500 -NumberRangeEnd 699
  description: |-
    This example changes the range of numbers for the call park orbit named "Redmond CPO 1" to 500 through 699.
    All values within this range must be unique among all call park orbit ranges within the organization.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsCallParkOrbit -Identity "Redmond CPO 2" -NumberRangeStart "*7000" -NumberRangeEnd "*7100"
  description: |-
    This example changes the range of numbers for the call park orbit named "Redmond CPO 2" to *7000 through *7100.
    All values within this range must be unique among all call park orbit ranges within the organization.
    Note that, unlike the preceding example, double quote marks were included around the values assigned to NumberRangeStart and NumberRangeEnd.
    If these values begin with a * or # (the only non-numeric values allowed) you must enclose the value in double quotes.

  name: Instance
  description: |+
    Allows you to pass a reference to an object to the cmdlet rather than set individual parameter values.
    This object must be of type DisplayCallParkOrbit, which can be retrieved by calling the `Get-CsCallParkOrbit` cmdlet.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NumberRangeEnd
  description: |+
    The last number in the range for this call park orbit.
    The value must be greater than or equal to the NumberRangeStart.
    The value must also be the same length as the value of the NumberRangeStart.
    For example, if NumberRangeStart is set to 100, NumberRangeEnd cannot be set to 1001.
    In addition, if the NumberRangeStart begins with a * or #, then NumberRangeEnd must begin with the same character.

    Valid values: Must match the regular expression string (\[\*|#\]?\[1-9\]\d{0,7})|(\[1-9\]\d{0,8}).
    This means that the value must be a string beginning with either the character * or # or a number 1 through 9 (the first character cannot be a zero).
    If the first character is * or # the following character must be a number 1 through 9 (it cannot be a zero).
    Subsequent characters can be any number 0 through 9 up to seven additional characters.
    (For example, "#6000", "*92000", and "*95551212".) If the first character is not * or #, the first character must be a number 1 through 9 (it cannot be zero), followed by up to eight characters, each a number 0 through 9.
    (For example, 915551212;41212;300.)

  description: |+
    The first number in the range for this call park orbit.
    The value must be less than or equal to the NumberRangeEnd.
    The value must also be the same length as the value of the NumberRangeEnd.

    Valid values: Must match the regular expression string (\[\*|#\]?\[1-9\]\d{0,7})|(\[1-9\]\d{0,8}).

    Subsequent characters can be any number 0 through 9 up to seven additional characters.
    (For example, "#6000", "*92000", and "*95551212".) The number following the * or # must be greater than 100.
    If the first character is not * or #, the first character must be a number 1 through 9 (it cannot be zero), followed by up to eight characters, each a number 0 through 9.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="OrbitType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Type
  description: |+
    Specifies the type of call park orbit.
    Skype for Business Server allows for two different types of call park orbits:

    CallPark.
    This is the standard call park orbit, in which a user places a call on hold and then can retrieve that call from any phone by dialing the specified call park number.
    CallPark is the default orbit type and will be used if the Type parameter is not specified.

    GroupPickup.
    With group pickup, users can answer any incoming call that is made to any member of their call pickup group.
    Call pickup groups are configured by administrators.

    To specify a call park orbit type, use syntax similar to this:

    `-Type GroupPickup`

    This parameter was introduced in the February 2013 release of Lync Server 2013.

description: |-
  Parking a call assigns a received phone call to a number within a specific range for later retrieval.
  A call park orbit is the set of numbers defined for this purpose.
  The `Set-CsCallParkOrbit` cmdlet enables you to change the number ranges and the ID of the Call Park service.
  The new range of numbers must be unique among all call park orbits defined within the organization.
