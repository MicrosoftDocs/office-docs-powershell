summary: |-
  Modifies an existing conferencing policy.
  Conferencing policies determine the features and capabilities that can be used in a conference; this includes everything from whether or not the conference can include IP audio and video to the maximum number of people who can attend a meeting.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsConferencingPolicy -Identity SalesConferencingPolicy -AllowConferenceRecording $False
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 modifies a property value of the conferencing policy SalesConferencingPolicy; in particular, the command sets the value of the AllowConferenceRecording property to False.
    To do this, the `Set-CsConferencingPolicy` cmdlet is called along with the Identity parameter and the AllowConferenceRecording parameter.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsConferencingPolicy | Set-CsConferencingPolicy -AllowAnonymousParticipantsInMeetings $False -EnableDialInConferencing $False
  description: |-
    In Example 2, the same two property values -- AllowAnonymousParticipantsInMeetings and EnableDialInConferencing -- are modified for all the conferencing policies configured for use in the organization.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsConferencingPolicy` cmdlet to return a collection of all the available conferencing policies.
    That collection is then piped to the `Set-CsConferencingPolicy` cmdlet, which sets the value of both the AllowAnonymousParticipantsInMeetings and EnableDialInConferencing properties to False for each policy in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsConferencingPolicy -Filter "site:*" | Set-CsConferencingPolicy -MaxVideoConferenceResolution CIF
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 3 modifies the MaxVideoConferenceResolution property for all the conferencing policies that have been configured at the site scope.
    To accomplish this task the command first calls the `Get-CsConferencingPolicy` cmdlet and the Filter parameter; the filter value "site:*" restricts the returned data to policies configured at the site scope.
    This filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsConferencingPolicy` cmdlet, which sets the MaxVideoConferenceResolution property for each policy in the collection to "CIF".
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsConferencingPolicy | Where-Object {$_.MaxMeetingSize -gt 100} | Set-CsConferencingPolicy -MaxMeetingSize 100
  description: |-
    Example 4 retrieves all the policies where the maximum meeting size is greater than (-gt) 100 and then changes the value of the associated property (MaxMeetingSize) to 100.
    To do this the command first calls the `Get-CsConferencingPolicy` cmdlet to return a collection of all the conferencing policies configured for use in the organization.
    That collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those policies that have a MaxMeetingSize greater than 100.
    The filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsConferencingPolicy` cmdlet, which takes each policy in the collection and sets the MaxMeetingSize property to 100.

    Indicates whether file transfers to all the meeting participants are allowed during the meeting.
    The default value is True.

    This setting applies to the user who organizes the conference: if set to False, no conference created by a user affected by this policy will allow file transfers.
    However, the user can take part in other conferences where file transfers are allowed.

  description: |+
    When set to True (the default value) clients will attempt to join a conference using multiview (which allows the client to receive multiple video streams during the conference).
    This parameter will be ignored if multiview is not allowed in the conference being joined.
    This setting is enforced at the per-user level and for both conferences and peer-to-peer communication sessions.
    That means that some users in a session might be allowed to have multiple video streams while other users in the same conference might not.

    After the maximum number of participants has been reached anyone else who tries to join the meeting will be turned away with the notice that the meeting is full.
    The number of participants specified in this value can be any 32-bit whole number (any value between 1 and 4,294,967,295), but the recommended size is between 2 and 250, inclusive; the default value is 250.

    250 is the maximum for shared pool deployments, based on Microsoft testing.

  Conferencing is an important part of Skype for Business Server: conferencing enables groups of users to come together online to view slides and video, share applications, exchange files and otherwise communicate and collaborate.

  It's important for administrators to maintain control over conferences and conference settings.
  In some cases, there might be security concerns: by default, anyone, including unauthenticated users, can participate in meetings and save any of the slides or handouts distributed during those meetings.
  In other cases, there might be bandwidth concerns: having a multitude of simultaneous meetings, each involving hundreds of participants and each featuring video feeds and file sharing, has the potential to cause problems with your network.
  In addition, there might be occasional legal concerns.
  For example, by default meeting participants are allowed to make annotations on shared content; however, these annotations are not saved when the meeting is archived.
  If your organization is required to keep a record of all electronic communication, you might want to disable annotations.

  Of course, needing to manage conferencing settings is one thing; actually managing these settings is another.
  In Skype for Business Server conferences are managed by using conferencing policies.
  (In previous versions of the software, these were known as meeting policies.) As noted, conferencing policies determine the features and capabilities that can be used in a conference, including everything from whether or not the conference can include IP audio and video to the maximum number of people who can attend a meeting.
  Conferencing policies can be configured at the global scope; at the site scope; or at the per-user scope.
  This provides administrators with enormous flexibility when it comes to deciding which capabilities will be made available to which users.

  Policy property values can be configured at the time a policy is created.
  In addition to that, you can, at any time, use the `Set-CsConferencingPolicy` cmdlet to modify the property values of an existing policy.
