    $credential = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

    The commands shown in Example 2 verify whether or not contacts for the user litwareinc\kenmyer can be found in the unified contact store.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell command-line interface credentials object for the user litwareinc\kenmyer.
    Note that you must supply the password for this account in order to create a valid credentials object and to ensure that the `Test-CsUnifiedContactStore` cmdlet can carry out its check.

    The second command in the example uses the supplied credentials object ($x) and the SIP address of the user litwareinc\kenmyer in order to determine whether or not his contacts can be found in the unified contact store.

    When present, detailed output from running the cmdlet will be stored in the specified variable.
    This variable includes a pair of methods - ToHTML and ToXML - that can then be used to save that output to either an HTML or an XML file.

    To store output in a logger variable named $TestOutput use the following syntax:

    `-OutLoggerVariable TestOutput`

    Note: Do not prepend a $ character when specifying the variable name.

    To save the information stored in the logger variable to an HTML file, use a command similar to this:

    `$TestOutput.ToHTML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.html`

    To save the information stored in the logger variable to an XML file, use a command similar to this:

    `$TestOutput.ToXML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.xml`

description: |-
  The unified contact store introduced in Lync Server 2013 gives administrators the option of storing a user's contacts in Exchange instead of in Skype for Business Server; in turn that allows the user to access the same set of contacts in Outlook and Outlook Web Access as well as in Skype for Business.
  (Alternatively, you can continue to store contacts in Skype for Business Server.
  In that case, users will have to maintain two separate sets of contacts: one for use with Outlook and Outlook Web App, and one for use with Skype for Business.)

  You can verify whether or not a user's contacts have been moved to the unified contact store by running the `Test-CsUnifiedContactStore` cmdlet.
  The `Test-CsUnifiedContactStore` cmdlet will take the specified user account, connect to the unified contact store, and attempt to retrieve a contact for the user.
  If no contacts can be retrieved then the command will fail along with the message "No contacts were received for the user.
  Verify that contacts exist for the user."

  Note that the `Test-CsUnifiedContactStore` cmdlet will fail if the user has successfully migrated to the unified contact store but does not have any contacts on his or her Contacts list.
  The specified user must have at least one contact in order for the `Test-CsUnifiedContactStore` cmdlet to complete successfully.

  Lync Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Test-csUnifiedContactStore` cmdlet are not available in the Lync Server Control Panel.
