# Set-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Modifies settings that determine how Skype for Business Server responds when users join or leave a dial-in conference.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Set-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration [[-Identity] <XdsIdentity>] [-EnableNameRecording <Boolean>] [-Force]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-EntryExitAnnouncementsEnabledByDefault <Boolean>]
 [-EntryExitAnnouncementsType <EntryExitAnnouncementsType>] [-AllowAnonymousPstnActivation <Boolean>]
 [-PinAuthType <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Instance
```
Set-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration [-Instance <PSObject>] [-EnableNameRecording <Boolean>] [-Force]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-EntryExitAnnouncementsEnabledByDefault <Boolean>]
 [-EntryExitAnnouncementsType <EntryExitAnnouncementsType>] [-AllowAnonymousPstnActivation <Boolean>]
 [-PinAuthType <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
When users join (or leave) a dial-in conference Skype for Business Server can respond in different ways.
For example, participants might be asked to record their name before they can enter the conference itself.
Likewise, administrators can decide whether they want to have Skype for Business Server announce that dial-in participants have either left or joined a conference.

These conference "join behaviors" are managed using dial-in conferencing configuration settings; these settings can be configured at the global scope or at the site scope.
When you first install Skype for Business Server, the only dial-in conferencing configuration settings you will have are the ones at the global scope; however, you can create new settings at the site scope by using the `New-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet.
In addition, you can modify any of these configuration settings (at either the global or site scopes) by using the `Set-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Set-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EntryExitAnnouncementsType "ToneOnly"
```

The command shown in Example 1 modifies the EntryExitAnnoucements property for the dial-in configuration settings for the Redmond site.
In this case, the EntryExitAnnouncementsType property is set to ToneOnly.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Get-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration | Set-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration -EnableNameRecording $True
```

Example 2 modifies all the dial-in conferencing configurations settings in use in the organization.
To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet to return a collection of all dial-in conferencing settings.
That collection is then piped to the `Set-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet, which sets the EnableNameRecording property for each item in the collection to True ($True).


### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------
```
Get-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration -Filter "site:*" | Set-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration -EnableNameRecording $True -EntryExitAnnouncementsType "UseNames"
```

Example 3 modifies all the dial-in conferencing settings that have been configured at the site scope.
To carry out this task, the command first uses the `Get-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet and the Filter parameter to return a collection of all the settings configured at the site scope; the filter value "site:*" restricts returned data to settings that have an Identity beginning with the string value "site:".
That filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsDialInConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet, which modifies the EnableNameRecording property and the EntryExitAnnouncementsType property for each item in the collection.
When the command finishes running, all the dial-in conferencing settings configured at the site scope will have their EnableNameRecording property set to True and their EntryExitAnnoucements property set to "UseNames".
