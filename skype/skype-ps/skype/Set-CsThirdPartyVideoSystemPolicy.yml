summary: |-
  Creates a new third-party video system policy for use with video teleconferencing (VTC) devices.
  These policies determine whether or not the VTC is allowed to send low-resolution video.
module: SkypeForBusiness

inputs:
- name: <xref href=" " data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    The `Set-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy` cmdlet accepts pipelined instance of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Policy.ThirdPartyVideoSystem.ThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy object.
outputs:
- name: <xref href=" " data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    None.
    Instead, the `Set-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy` cmdlet modifies existing instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Policy.ThirdPartyVideoSystem.ThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy object.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy -Identity "RedmondVideoSystemPolicy" -SupportsSendingLowResolution $False
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 modifies the per-user third-party video system policy RedmondVideoSystemPolicy.
    In this example, the ability to send low-resolution video is disabled.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy -Filter "site:*" | Set-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy -SupportsSendingLowResolution $False
  description: |-
    In Example 2, the ability to send low-resolution video is disabled for all third-party video system policies configured at the site scope.
    To do that, the command first calls `Get-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy` along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "site:*" limits returned data to policies configured at the site scope.
    That collection of site-based policies is then piped to the `Set-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy` to set the SupportsSendingLowResolution property to False ($False).

- type: <xref href="XdsIdentity" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    Unique identity assigned to the policy when it was created.
    Third-party video system policies can be created at the global, site or per-user scope.
    To refer to the global instance, use this syntax:

    `-Identity "global"`

    To refer to a policy at the site scope, use syntax similar to this:

    `-Identity "site:Redmond"`

    To refer to a policy at the per-user scope, use syntax similar to the following:

    `-Identity "RedmondVideoSystemPolicy"`

    Wildcard characters such as the asterisk (*) cannot be used with the Identity parameter.
    If this parameter is not specified then `Set-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy` will modify the global video system policy.

description: |-
  Third-party video systems are VTC devices that provide remote users with telepresence capabilities (most notably audio and video).
  In Skype for Business Server, third-party VTC devices can be configured as Active Directory contact objects, much in the same way that analog phones and common area phones can be configured as contact objects.
  Associating each VTC device with a contact object makes it easy for administrators to track, and to manage, these devices.

  One key management task related to VTC devices is to enable (or disable) the ability of these devices to send low-resolution video.
  By default, VTC devices are allowed to send low-resolution video.
  However, administrators can create third-party video system policies that disable the use of low-resolution video.
  This might be useful for devices located in conference rooms or other areas where low-resolution video is not considered acceptable.
  The `New-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem` cmdlet provides a way for administrators to create these third-party video system policies.
  Both the global policy and any custom policies you create can later be modified by using the `Set-CsThirdPartyVideoSystemPolicy` cmdlet.
