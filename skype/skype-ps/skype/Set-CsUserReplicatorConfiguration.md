# Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Modifies an existing collection of User Replicator configuration settings.
The User Replicator periodically retrieves up-to-date user account information from Active Directory Domain Services and then synchronizes the new information with the current user data stored by Skype for Business Server.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

## DESCRIPTION
Although Skype for Business Server maintains its own database of user accounts and user account data, Skype for Business Server still relies on AD DS as the ultimate source for user information.
For example, when a new Active Directory user account is created, you must supply basic information about the user account (such the Active Directory display name).
When a user is enabled for Skype for Business Server, however, you do not need to specify a new display name.
That's because Skype for Business Server uses the display name already stored in AD DS.

User account information, including the Active Directory display name, is subject to change over time.
For example, a user who gets married might change her last name and, in turn, need to change her display name as well.
In order to ensure that the Skype for Business Server database and AD DS remain in synch, Skype for Business Server must periodically check in with AD DS, retrieve the latest user account updates and then modify the Skype for Business Server user database accordingly.
This synchronization between AD DS and Skype for Business Server is carried out by the User Replicator.

When you install Skype for Business Server, a global set of User Replicator configuration settings is created for you.
By default, these settings are used to manage the User Replicator on an organization-wide basis.
Management of the User Replicator consists of identifying the domains that Skype for Business Server needs to synch with in addition to indicating how often the User Replicator checks AD DS for user account updates.
By default, the User Replicator discovers and synchs with all available domains.
However, by using the AdDomainNamingContextList property you can restrict synchronization to a specific set of domains: the domains that appear in the AdDomainNamingContextList property.

You can also create additional collections at the service scope, but only if you are working with Skype for Business Online.

The `Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration` cmdlet enables you to modify any of the User Replicator settings currently in use in your organization.
You can use this cmdlet to add or remove domains from the list of domains the User Replicator must synchronize with and to modify the time interval between replication cycles.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity global -ReplicationCycleInterval "00:05:00"
```

Example 1 sets the value of the ReplicationCycleInterval of the global User Replicator settings to five minutes (00 hours: 05 minutes: 00 seconds).


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity global -ADDomainNamingContextList $Null
```

The command shown in Example 2 clears the value of the ADDomainNamingContextList property.
This task is carried out by including the ADDomainNamingContextList parameter and setting the parameter value to null.
By setting this value to null the User Replicator will automatically discover and synchronize with all the available domains.


### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------
```
Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity global -ADDomainNamingContextList @{Add="dc=fabrikam,dc=com"}
```

In Example 3 an additional name is added to the ADDomainNamingContextList property of the global User Replicator settings.
To do this, the syntax @{Add=} is used, along with the distinguished name of the domain being added.
When this command is run, fabrikam.com will be added to the list of domain names.
To configure the global settings so that only fabrikam.com is on the list use this syntax:

`-ADDomainNamingContextList @{Replace="dc=fabrikam,dc=com"}`

When the AdDomainNamingContextList property is set to anything but a null value, the User Replicator will only synchronize with the domains listed in the property value.
This will be the case even if there are other domains in the deployment.


### -------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------
```
Set-CsUserReplicatorConfiguration -Identity global -ADDomainNamingContextList @{Remove="dc=fabrikam,dc=com"}
```

Example 4 removes the domain fabrikam.com from the ADDomainNamingContextList property of the global User Replicator configuration settings.
To do this the syntax `@{Remove=}` is used, along with the distinguished name (DN) of the domain (dc=fabrikam,dc=com).


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier of the User Replicator configuration settings to be modified.
To modify the global settings, use this syntax:

`-Identity global`


```yaml
Type: XdsIdentity
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Instance
Allows you to pass a reference to an object to the cmdlet rather than set individual parameter values.

```yaml
Type: PSObject
Parameter Sets: Instance
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ADDomainNamingContextList
Distinguished names of the Active Directory domains that the User Replicator must synchronize with.
For example, to add a domain to the list use syntax similar to this:

`-ADDomainNamingContextList @{Add="dc=fabrikam,dc=com"}`

If you set this property to a null value the User Replicator will discover and synchronize with all available domains.
If this property is not null then the User Replicator will only synchronize with the domains specified in the ADDomainNamingContextList.

```yaml
Type: PSListModifier
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ReplicationCycleInterval
Represents the amount of time that the User Replicator waits before checking for user account updates in AD DS.
The replication cycle interval can be any time value between 1 second and 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds; the default value is 1 minute.
The interval must be expressed using the format hours:minutes:seconds.
For example, this syntax sets to time interval to one hour and 15 minutes:

`-ReplicationCycleInterval 01:15:00`

```yaml
Type: TimeSpan
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
Suppresses the display of any non-fatal error message that might occur when running the command.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Describes what would happen if you executed the command without actually executing the command.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainControllerList
List of domain controllers to be used for user replication.
Typically the user replicator service is able to identify domain controllers by using the DsGetDcName Windows API.
Because of this, it is recommended that you consult with Microsoft support personnel before manually selecting domain controllers by using this parameter.

```yaml
Type: PSListModifier
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SkipFirstSyncAllowedDowntime
Indicates how long Skype for Business Server should wait for user data to synchronize before marking the service as started.
The default value is 2 hours (02:00:00), meaning that, after 2 hours, the status of the replication service will changed from Pending to Started.

```yaml
Type: TimeSpan
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019
