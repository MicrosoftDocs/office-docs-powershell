## DESCRIPTION
Many Skype for Business Server components are web-based: these components either use Web Services or webpages to carry out their tasks.
For example, users employ a Web service when searching for new contacts in the Address Book or when using group expansion to view the individual members of a distribution group.
Likewise, components ranging from dial-in conferencing to Skype for Business Server use web pages as the interface between Skype for Business Server Control Panel and users.

The CsWebServiceConfiguration cmdlets enable administrators to manage Web Services configuration settings throughout the organization.
This includes managing group expansion, certificate settings and allowed authentication methods.
Because you can configure different settings at the global, site and service scope (albeit for only the Web Services service), you can customize Web Services capabilities for different users and different locations.

New Web Services configuration settings are created by using the `New-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet.
Note that these settings can only be created at the site or service scope (and only for the Web Services service); your command will fail if you try to create a new collection at the global scope.
Likewise, your command will fail if you try to create a new collection at, for instance, the Redmond site and that site already hosts a collection of Web service settings.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
New-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EnableGroupExpansion $False -UseCertificateAuth $True
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of Web Services configuration settings for the Redmond site (-Identity site:Redmond).
This example includes two optional parameters: EnableGroupExpansion, which is set to False ($False) and UseCertificateAuth, which is set to True ($True).
These two parameters are used to disable group expansion and enable the use of certificates for authentication, respectively.

Note that this command will fail if a collection of Web Services configuration settings has already been created for the Redmond site.
That's because sites are limited to a single collection of Web Services configuration settings.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
$x = New-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -InMemory

$x.EnableGroupExpansion = $False

$x.UseCertificateAuth = $True

Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Instance $x
```

Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the new collection of Web Services configuration settings is initially created in memory only and is only later applied to the Redmond site.
In order to do this, the first command in the example uses the `New-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet to create a collection of settings for the Redmond site; the InMemory parameter is included to ensure that this collection is created in memory only and is not immediately applied to the Redmond site.
(Because the settings exist only in memory, they must be stored in a variable.
In this case, that's a variable named $x.)

Commands 2 and 3 in the example take these virtual configuration settings and modify the values of the EnableGroupExpansion and UseCertificateAuth properties.
After these changes have been made, the final command uses the `Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet to take the virtual settings and apply them to the Redmond site.
If you do not call the `Set-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet, no new settings will be assigned to the site.
Instead, your virtual Web Services configuration settings will disappear as soon as you end your Windows PowerShell session or delete the variable $x.


### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
$x = New-CsWebOrigin -Url "http://fabrikam.com"

New-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" - CrossDomainAuthorizationList $x
```

The commands shown in Example 3 add the domain http://fabrikam.com to the authorized domains list for a new collection of Web service configuration settings being created for the Redmond site.
To do this, the first command in the example uses the `New-CsWebOrigin` cmdlet to create a domain object for fabrikam.com.
The resulting domain object is stored in a variable named $x.

The second command in the example uses the `New-CsWebServiceConfiguration` cmdlet to create the Web service configuration settings for the Redmond site.
The syntax `- CrossDomainAuthorizationList $x` adds http://fabrikam.com to the collection of domains authorized for cross-domain scripting.


### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```
$x = New-CsWebOrigin -Url "http://fabrikam.com"

$y = New-CsWebOrigin -Url "http://contoso.com"

New-CsWebServiceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" - CrossDomainAuthorizationList $x, $y
```

Example 4 shows how you can add multiple authorized domains to a new collection of Web service configuration settings.
To add multiple domains, you must create multiple domain objects, storing each in a separate variable.
In Example 4, the domain object for http://fabrikam.com is stored in a variable named $x, while the domain object for http://contoso.com is stored in a variable named $y.

After all the domain objects have been created, all you need to do is include each variable name in the parameter value for the CrossDomainAuthorizationList parameter.
For example:

`-CrossDomainAuthorizationList $x, $y`


## PARAMETERS
