  The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
  Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
  Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

  However, if you have users running legacy clients (such as Microsoft Lync 2010 these users might find the default Persistent Chat URIs difficult to work with and difficult to use when pointing their legacy client towards the pool.
  Because of this, administrators can use the New-CsPersistentChatEndpoint cmdlet to create an additional contact object for the pool, a contact object that provides a friendlier, easier-to-use URI.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the New-CsPersistentChatEndpoint cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
