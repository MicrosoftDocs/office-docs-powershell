# Grant-CsClientPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

Assigns a client policy to a user or a group of users.
Among other things, client policies help determine the features of Skype for Business Server that are available to users; for example, you might give some users the right to transfer files while denying this right to other users.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
Grant-CsClientPolicy [-Identity] <UserIdParameter> [[-PolicyName] <String>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-PassThru] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-Tenant <Object>] [-AsJob] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Client policies are applied each time a user accesses the system, regardless of where the user logs on from and regardless of the type of device the user logs on with.
In addition, client policies, like other Skype for Business Server policies, can readily be targeted to selected groups of users.
You can even create a custom policy that gets assigned to a single user.

Client policies can be configured at the global, site, and per-user scopes.
In order to assign per-user policies to users, you must use the Grant-CsClientPolicy cmdlet.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

Grant-CsClientPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName SalesPolicy
```

In Example 1, the client policy SalesPolicy is assigned to the user with the Identity Ken Myer.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsUser -LDAPFilter "Department=Sales" | Grant-CsClientPolicy -PolicyName SalesPolicy
```

In Example 2, all the users who belong to the Sales department are assigned the SalesPolicy client policy.
The command first uses the Get-CsUser cmdlet and the LdapFilter parameter to return a collection of all the users who are members of the Sales department.
This collection of users is then piped to the Grant-CsClientPolicy cmdlet, which assigns the policy SalesPolicy to each user in the collection.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsUser -LDAPFilter "(&(Title=Accountant)(l=Redmond))" | Grant-CsClientPolicy -PolicyName RedmondAccountingPolicy

```

In Example 3, the client policy RedmondAccountingPolicy is assigned to all the users who meet two criteria: 1) the user must have the job title Accountant; and, 2) the user must work in the city of Redmond.
To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsUser cmdlet and the LdapFilter parameter to return a collection of all the users who work in Redmond and have the job title Accountant.
The filter value "(&(Title=Accountant)(l=Redmond))" limits the returned data to users who have the job title Accountant (Title=Accountant) and (&) who work in Redmond (l=Redmond).
(The "l" is a lowercase L, and represents the user's locality.)

The resulting collection is then piped to the Grant-CsClientPolicy cmdlet, which assigns the policy RedmondAccountingPolicy to each user in the collection.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsUser -LdapFilter "(|(Title=Accountant)(Title=Senior Accountant))" | Grant-CsClientPolicy -PolicyName AccountingPolicy
```

Example 4 assigns the policy AccountingPolicy to all the users who meet one of two criteria: either the user has the job title Accountant or the user has the job title Senior Accountant.
To carry out this task, the Get-CsUser cmdlet and the LdapFilter parameter are used to return a collection of users with the job title Accountant or Senior Accountant.
The filter value "(|(Title=Accountant)(Title=Senior Accountant))" limits the returned data to users with the job title Accountant (Title=Accountant) or (|) users with the job title Senior Accountant (Title=Senior Accountant).
This filtered collection is then piped to the Grant-CsClientPolicy cmdlet, which assigns the client policy AccountingPolicy to each user in the collection.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 5 -------------------------- 
```

Get-CsUser -Filter {RegistrarPool -eq "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} | Grant-CsClientPolicy -PolicyName AtlantaBranchPolicy
```

In Example 5 all the users with accounts on the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com are assigned the client policy AtlantaBranchPolicy.
To do this, the Get-CsUser cmdlet is first called to return the appropriate user accounts; the Filter parameter and the filter value {RegistrarPool -eq "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} ensure that only user accounts homed on the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com will be returned.
This collection is then piped to the Grant-CsClientPolicy cmdlet, which assigns each user the client policy AtlantaBranchPolicy.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

Indicates the Identity of the user account the policy should be assigned to.
User Identities can be specified by using one of four formats: 1) the user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (for example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).
User Identities can also be referenced by using the user's Active Directory distinguished name.

In addition, you can use the asterisk (*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
For example, the Identity "* Smith" returns all the users who have a display name that ends in the string value " Smith".




```yaml
Type: UserIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Online, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PolicyName

"Name" of the policy to be assigned.
The PolicyName is simply the policy Identity minus the policy scope ("tag:").
For example, a policy that has the Identity tag:Redmond has a PolicyName equal to Redmond; a policy with the Identity tag:RedmondConferencingPolicy has a PolicyName equal to RedmondConferencingPolicy.

If you set PolicyName to a null value, then the command will unassign any per-user policy assigned to the user.
For example:

`Grant-CsClientPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName $Null`



```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

Enables you to specify a domain controller to connect to when assigning the policy.
If this parameter is not included then the cmdlet will use the first available domain controller.



```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Online, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru

If present, causes the cmdlet to pass the user object (or objects) through the Windows PowerShell pipeline.
By default, the Grant-CsClientPolicy cmdlet does not pass objects through the pipeline.



```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Online, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Describes what would happen if you executed the command without actually executing the command.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Online, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before executing the command.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Online, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Tenant
Globally unique identifier (GUID) of the tenant account whose hybrid configuration settings are being returned.
For example:

`-Tenant "38aad667-af54-4397-aaa7-e94c79ec2308"`

You can return your tenant ID by running this command:

`Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID`

If you are using a remote session of Windows PowerShell and are connected only to Skype for Business Online you do not have to include the Tenant parameter.
Instead, the tenant ID will automatically be filled in for you based on your connection information.
The Tenant parameter is primarily for use in a hybrid deployment.

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Skype for Business Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
