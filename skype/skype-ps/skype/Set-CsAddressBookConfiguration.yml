    The `Set-CsAddressBookConfiguration` cmdlet does not return a value or object.
    Instead, the cmdlet configures instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Settings.AddressBook.AddressBookSettings object.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsAddressBookConfiguration -identity site:Redmond -RunTimeOfDay 23:00
  description: |-
    This example sets the RunTimeOfDay property (the property that determines the time of day when Address Book synchronization takes place) to 23:00 (11:00 PM on a 24-hour clock).
    The Identity parameter is used to limit the change to the Address Book configuration settings with the identity site:Redmond.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsAddressBookConfiguration -Filter site:* | Set-CsAddressBookConfiguration -RunTimeOfDay 23:00
  description: |-
    In Example 2, the RunTimeOfDay property is set to 11:00 PM (23:00) for all the Address Book setting collections configured at the site scope.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsAddressBookConfiguration` cmdlet and the Filter parameter to return a collection of all the site-specific settings; the filter value "site:*" limits the returned data to collections configured at the site scope.
    This information is then piped to the `Set-CsAddressBookConfiguration` cmdlet, which modifies the value of the RunTimeOfDay property for each item in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsAddressBookConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.KeepDuration -lt 30} | Set-CsAddressBookConfiguration -KeepDuration 30
  description: |-
    Example 3 modifies the KeepDuration property for any Address Book settings collections where KeepDuration is less than 30 days.
    To carry out this task, the `Get-CsAddressBookConfiguration` cmdlet is used, without any additional parameters, to return a collection of all the Address Book settings configured for use in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which selects only those settings where the KeepDuration property is less than 30 days.
    This filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsAddressBookConfiguration` cmdlet, which changes the value of the KeepDuration property for each item in the collection to 30 days.

  name: EnableFileGeneration
  description: |+
    When set to True (the default value) the Address Book server generates Address Book index files that can be downloaded by clients.
    When set to False, these index files are not generated.
    That means that client applications will have to use the Address Book Web Query service when searching for contacts.

  description: |+
    When set to True, users will be able to search for contacts by using their mobile device keypad.
    This can be a convenience for mobile users, but has the potential to greatly increase the size of your Address Book database.

    The default value is True ($True).

  name: Identity
  description: |+
    Unique identifier assigned to the collection of Address Book settings.
    To refer to the global settings, use this syntax: `-Identity global`.
    To refer to a collection configured at the site scope, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity site:Redmond`.
    You cannot use wildcard characters when specifying an Identity.

    If this parameter is omitted, then the `Set-CsAddressBookConfiguration` cmdlet will modify the global settings.

  name: IgnoreGenericRules
  description: |+
    Indicates whether or not the Address Book server ignores the generic normalization rules used when parsing phone numbers.
    Generic rules are the rules that are built into Skype for Business Server.
    These rules cannot be changed; however, by setting the value of this property to True you can instruct your Address Book servers to ignore these rules and instead use custom rules that you create yourself.
    The default value is False.

  name: KeepDuration
  description: |+
    Specifies the amount of time (in days) that Address Book servers will keep change files.
    Change files older than the value of the KeepDuration property will be deleted.
    The KeepDuration can be set to any integer value between 1 and 90, inclusive.
    The default value is 30 days.

  name: MaxDeltaFileSizePercentage
  description: |+
    When changes are made to Active Directory (such as a new user being enabled for Skype for Business Server), the Address Book server typically records these changes in a "delta file," a file consisting only of the updated information; Skype for Business Server can then download the delta files rather than a complete Address Book file.
    The MaxDeltaFileSizePercentage property determines how large the delta files can get before they are incorporated into the complete Address Book file.
    By default, delta files can be as large as 20 percent of the complete Address Book file before a new Address Book file is generated.
    At that point, clients will download the complete file rather than a delta file.

    MaxDeltaFileSizePercentage must be entered as a percentage value between 1 and 100, inclusive.

    The RunTimeOfDay property is based on a 24-hour clock (hours:minutes:seconds), with 00:00:00 representing midnight and 23:59:00 representing 11:59 P.M..

    The default value is 01:30:00 (1:30 A.M.).

description: |-
  Address Book servers are intermediaries between AD DS and Skype for Business Server.
  The Address Book server ensures that the user information stored in Skype for Business Server is in synch with the user information stored in AD DS.
  This is done by periodically synching Address Book files with information stored in the User database.

  In addition, Address Book servers periodically generate index files that are downloaded to computers running Skype for Business Server.
  When a user searches for contacts, he or she either search through these index files or search the Address Book index files stored in the Central Management store.

  Address Book servers are governed using Address Book configuration settings; these settings determine such things as how often Address Book files are synchronized with the user database and how often these Address Book index files are generated.
  When you install Skype for Business Server, a set of global Address Book settings is created for you.
  You can also create custom configuration settings that can be applied to individual sites.
  These settings, if they exist, apply to any Address Book servers operating in the site, and take precedence over the global settings.

  The `Set-CsAddressBookConfiguration` cmdlet enables you to modify any of the Address Book configuration settings collection currently in use in your organization.
