    Set-CsEnhancedEmergencyServiceDisclaimer -Body "Warning: If you do not provide a location, emergency services may be delayed in reaching your location should you need to call for help."

uid: SkypeForBusiness.Set-CsEnhancedEmergencyServiceDisclaimer
name: Set-CsEnhancedEmergencyServiceDisclaimer
description: |-
  In order for an Enterprise Voice implementation to provide E9-1-1 service, locations must be mapped to ports, subnets, switches and wireless access points to identify the caller's location.
  When the caller is connecting from outside one of these mapped points, they must enter their location manually for it to be received by emergency services.
  This cmdlet sets a text string that will be displayed to users who decide not to enter their location information.
  This message will be displayed only if the LocationRequired property of the user's location policy is set to Disclaimer.
  (You can retrieve location policy settings by calling the `Get-CsLocationPolicy` cmdlet.)
