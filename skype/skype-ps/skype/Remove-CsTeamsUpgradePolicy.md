# Remove-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy

## SYNOPSIS
In on-premises deployments of Skype for Business Server, TeamsUpgradePolicy enables adminstrators to control whether users see a notification in their Skype for Business client of a pending upgrade to Teams. In addition, when this policy is assigned to a user, administrators can optionally have Win32 versions of Skype for Business clients silently download the Teams app based on the value of TeamsUpgradeConfiguration.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy  [-Identity] <XdsIdentity>
```

## DESCRIPTION
In on-premises deployments of Skype for Business Server, TeamsUpgradePolicy enables adminstrators to control whether users see a notification of a pending upgrade to Teams in their Skype for Business client. The Remove-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy lets the adminstrator remove instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy that were previously created by the administrator.

Instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy created  on-premises will not apply to any users that are already homed online. This cmdlet cannot be used to remove the built-in instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy provided in Office 365. There is no Remove-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy cmdlet for the online environment by design.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -Identity Site:Redmond1
```

This removes the TeamsUpgradePolicy for site named Redmond1.

## PARAMETERS

The identity of the policy. To specify the global policy for the organization, use "global". To specify a specific site, use "site:" where is the name of the site. To specfy a policy that can be assigned as needed to any users, simply specify a name of your choosing.
