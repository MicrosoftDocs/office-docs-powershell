  Although Skype for Business Server is available in multiple languages, the software is not a true MUI (multilingual user interface) application.
  Among other things, this means that the user interface for the Skype for Business Server does not change languages any time you change the operating system language.
  For example, suppose you have installed the U.S.
  English version of Skype for Business Server and are also running the Windows operating system under U.S.
  English.
  If you change the operating system culture (that is, the language and regional settings) to Danish, the Skype for Business Server Management Shell will not automatically follow suit; instead, the Skype for Business Server Management Shell user interface (including error messages and help text) will remain in U.S.
  English.
  If you need to change the culture for the Skype for Business Server Management Shell, you must run the Set-CsUICulture cmdlet.

  The Get-CsUICulture cmdlet provides a way for you to determine the culture currently used in the Skype for Business Server Management Shell.
