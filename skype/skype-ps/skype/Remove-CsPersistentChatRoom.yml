examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Remove-CsPersistentChatRoom -Identity "atl-gc-001.litwareinc.com\RedmondChatRoom"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 removes the Persistent Chat chat room RedmondChatRoom.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsPersistentChatRoom | Remove-CsPersistentChatRoom
  description: |-
    In Example 2, all the Persistent Chat chat rooms in use in the organization are removed.
    To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsPersistentChatRoom` cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the available chat rooms.
    This collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsPersistentChatRoom` cmdlet, which deletes each room in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsPersistentChatRoom -Privacy "Closed" | Remove-CsPersistentChatRoom
  description: |-
    Example 3 removes all the "closed" chat rooms.
    (A closed chat room means that any user can locate the chat room by doing a directory search, but only members can participate in chat room activities.) To accomplish this task, the command first uses the `Get-CsPersistentChatRoom` cmdlet and the Privacy parameter to return a collection of all the closed chat rooms.
    This collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsPersistentChatConfiguration` cmdlet, which deletes each room in the collection.

  The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
  Conversations can be based around specific topics and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
  Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

  Persistent Chat discussions take the form of messages posted in individual chat rooms; chat rooms are discussion forums based on specific topics.
  By design, messages posted in a chat room remain there forever; at any time, users can return to the room and review all the messages that have been previously posted.

  The `Remove-CsPersistentChatRoom` cmdlet provides a way for administrators to remove one or more of the Persistent Chat chat rooms that have been configured for use in the organization.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: To delete an existing Persistent Chat chat room using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click Persistent Chat, click Room and then select the room to be deleted.
  To delete the room, click Edit and then click Delete.
