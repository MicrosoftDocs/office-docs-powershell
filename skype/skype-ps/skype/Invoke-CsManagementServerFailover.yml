  The Invoke-CsManagementServerFailover cmdlet enables administrators to "failover" the Central Management Server (CMS).
  You can only invoke the failover to the database defined in the Topology Builder.
  The Invoke-CsManagementServerFailover cmdlet provides two methods for failing over the CMS:

  Failover when the CMS is available by running the cmdlet without any target database parameters as in Example 1.

  Failover when the CMS is unavailable (in disaster recovery mode) by specifying the BackupSqlServerFqdn parameter and the corresponding BackupSqlInstanceName parameter as in Example 2.
  If the database defined in the Topology Builder is mirrored, add the BackupMirrorSqlServerFqdn and BackupMirrorSqlInstanceName parameters.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the Invoke-CsManagementServerFailover cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
