  description: |+
    Indicates whether dialback negotiation will be supported.
    With dialback negotiation, when Server A contacts Server B communication is not immediately established.
    Instead, Server B first attempts to verify the identity of Server A by contacting the authoritative DNS server for the domain that Server A claims to be from.

    Note that dialback negotiation is not as secure as SASL or TLS.
    Instead, it is primarily used in situations where certificates cannot be used to verify a server's identity.

    The default value is True.

  The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a standard communications protocol (based on XML) used for sending messages across the Internet.
  XMPP was originally named Jabber and is supported by a number of Internet messaging and communication applications, including Google Talk and Facebook Chat.

  In order for your users to be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with users on an XMPP network, that network must be configured as an XMPP allowed partner.
  (You must also assign your users an external access policy that allows XMPP access.) By design, your users will be allowed to communicate with users on any XMPP network that is listed on the allowed partners list.
  If you do not want users communicating with users from a given network then you must delete that network from the allowed partners list.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: To create a new XMPP allowed partner using Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click External User Access, click XMPP Federated Partners and then click New.
