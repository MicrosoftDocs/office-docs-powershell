  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Enables you to use wildcard characters in order to return one or more OAuth servers.
    For example, to return all of the OAuth servers that have an Identity that includes the string value "Microsoft" use this syntax:

    `-Filter "*Microsoft*"`

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Lync Server 2013
  - Skype for Business Server 2015
  - Skype for Business Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    Unique identifier for the OAuth server to be returned.
    For example:

    `-Identity "Office 365"`

    If neither the Identity parameter nor the Filter parameter is included in the command then the Get-CsOAuthServer cmdlet will return information about all your OAuth servers.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Lync Server 2013
  - Skype for Business Server 2015
  - Skype for Business Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LocalStore
  description: |+

  name: Tenant
  description: |+
    Globally unique identifier (GUID) of the Skype for Business Online tenant account whose OAuth server settings are to be retrieved.

    For example:

    `-Tenant "38aad667-af54-4397-aaa7-e94c79ec2308"`

    You can return the tenant ID for each of your tenants by running this command:

    `Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID`

description: |-
  In Skype for Business Server, server-to-server authentication (for example, the authentication that enables Skype for Business Server and Exchange to share information) is carried out using the OAuth security protocol.
  This type of authentication typically requires three servers: the two servers that need to communicate with one another (Server A and B) and a third-party security token server.
  If Servers A and B need to communicate with one another, the two servers contact the token server (also known as an OAuth server) and obtain mutually-trusted security tokens that the two servers can exchange in order to prove their identities.

  If you are using an on-premises version of Skype for Business Server and you need to communicate with another server product that fully supports the OAuth protocol then you typically do not need to use a token server; that's because these server products are able to issue their own security tokens.
  However, if you need to communicate with another server product then you will need to use a token servers.
  These token servers can be managed by using the CsOAuthServer cmdlets.

  The functions carried out by the Get-CsOAuthServer cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
