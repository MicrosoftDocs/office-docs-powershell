examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsCertificate
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 returns information about the certificates currently assigned to Skype for Business Server components.
    This is done by calling the Get-CsCertificate cmdlet without any additional parameters.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsCertificate -Type WebServicesInternal
  description: |-
    Example 2 retrieves all the Skype for Business Server certificates used for internal Web services.
    To do this, the Type parameter is included, along with the parameter value WebServicesInternal.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsCertificate | Where-Object {$_.NotAfter -lt "9/1/2018"}
  description: |-
    Example 3 returns all the Skype for Business Server certificates that expire before September 1, 2018.
    To carry out this task, the command first uses the Get-CsCertificate cmdlet to return a collection of all the Skype for Business Server certificates currently in use.
    This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those certificates that expire before September 1, 2018.
    The date specified in this example (9/1/2018) uses the U.S.
    English format for date-time values.
    Dates should be specified using a format compatible with your Regional and Language Options.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsCertificate | Where-Object {$_.Issuer -eq "Cn=MyCa"}
  description: |-
    Example 4 returns information about all the Skype for Business Server certificates issued by the certification authority (CA) MyCa.
    To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsCertificate cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the certificates currently in use.
    This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out all the certificates where the Issuer property is equal to (-eq) "Cn=MyCa".

- title: '-------------------------- Example 5 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsCertificate | Where-Object {$_.Subject -eq "CN=atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"}
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 5 returns all the Skype for Business Server certificates where the Subject property has been set to CN=atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    This is done by using the Get-CsCertificate cmdlet to return a collection of all the Skype for Business Server certificates, then piping that collection to the Where-Object cmdlet.
    In turn, the Where-Object cmdlet selects only those certificates where the Subject property is equal to "CN=atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com".

description: |-
  Skype for Business Server uses certificates as a way for servers and server roles to verify their identities; for example, an Edge Server uses certificates to verify that the computer it is communicating with really is a Front End Server, and vice versa.
  In order to fully implement Skype for Business Server you will need to have the appropriate certificates assigned to the appropriate server roles.

  The Get-CsCertificate cmdlet provides a way for you to retrieve detailed information about the certificates that have been configured for use with Skype for Business Server.
  Note that the cmdlet only returns information about Skype for Business Server certificates.
  If a certificate has not been configured for use with Skype for Business Server (by using the Set-CsCertificate cmdlet) then that certificate will not be returned when you run the Get-CsCertificate cmdlet.
