### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Modifies an existing collection of conferencing configuration settings.
  Conference settings determine such things as the maximum allowed size for meeting content and handouts; the content grace period (that is, the amount of time content will be stored before being deleted) and the URLs for the internal and external downloads of the supported client.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

    The `Set-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet does not return a value or object.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsConferencingConfiguration -Identity global -Organization Litwareinc
  description: |-
    In Example 1, the `Set-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet modifies the global instance of conferencing configuration settings; in this case, the command sets the value of the Organization property to Litwareinc.
    This is done by including the Organization parameter followed by the organization name: Litwareinc.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsConferencingConfiguration | Set-CsConferencingConfiguration -Organization Litwareinc
  description: |-
    Example 2 is an extension of the first example; in this case, the command modifies the value of the Organization property for each collection of conferencing configuration settings currently in use.
    To do this the command first uses the `Get-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet to retrieve a collection of all the conferencing configuration settings.
    This collection is then piped to the `Set-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet, which takes each item in the collection and changes the value of the Organization property to Litwareinc.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsConferencingConfiguration -Filter site:* | Set-CsConferencingConfiguration -MaxContentStorageMb 50
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 3 changes the value of the MaxContentStorageMb property for all the conferencing configuration settings applied at the site scope.
    To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "site:*" ensures that only settings where the Identity begins with the characters "site:" are returned.
    The filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet, which changes the MaxContentStorageMb property value for each item in the collection to 50.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsConferencingConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.MaxContentStorageMb -gt 100} | Set-CsConferencingConfiguration -MaxContentStorageMB 100
  description: |-
    In Example 4, all the conferencing configuration settings that allow for content storage of more than 100 megabytes are modified to set the maximum allowed content storage to 100 megabytes.
    To carry out this task, the command first calls the `Get-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the conferencing configuration settings currently in use.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out those settings where the MaxContentStorageMb property is greater than 100.
    This filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet, which takes each item in the collection and sets the value of the MaxContentStorageMb property to 100.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 5 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsConferencingConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -ContentGracePeriod "22:00:00"
  description: |-
    Example 5 retrieves the conferencing configuration settings for the Redmond site (-Identity site:Redmond) and modifies the value of the ContentGracePeriod property, setting the grace period to 22 hours (22 hours: 00 minutes: 00 seconds).
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 6 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsConferencingConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.Organization -ne "Fabrikam"} | Set-CsConferencingConfiguration -Organization Litwareinc
  description: |-
    In Example 6, all the conferencing configuration settings that do not list Fabrikam as the Organization are modified; in particular, all these settings are assigned Litwareinc as the new organization.
    To accomplish this task, the command first calls the `Get-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet without any parameters; this returns a collection of all the conferencing configuration settings currently in use in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which selects all the settings where the Organization property is not equal to (-ne) Fabrikam.
    The filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet; the `Set-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet takes each item in the collection and changes the value of the Organization property to Litwareinc.

name: Set-CsConferencingConfiguration
description: |-
  For conferences, management and administration is split between two sets of cmdlets.
  If you want to manage the things users can and cannot do (for example, can users invite anonymous participants to join a conference, are users allowed to offer application sharing in a conference, or are users allowed to transfer files within a conference), then you need to use the CsConferencingPolicy cmdlets.

  In addition to managing user activities, administrators need to manage the Web Conferencing service.
  For example, administrators need to be able to do such things as specify the maximum amount of content storage allotted to a single conference and to specify the grace period before that conference content is automatically deleted.
  They also need to be able to specify the ports used for activities such as application sharing and file transfer.

  These latter activities can be managed by using the CsConferencingConfiguration cmdlets.
  These cmdlets enable you to manage the actual servers themselves.
  The CsConferencingConfiguration cmdlets (which can be applied to the global, the site, and the service scopes) aren't used to specify whether or not a user can share applications during a conference; if application sharing is allowed, however, these cmdlets enable you to indicate which ports should be used for that activity.
  Likewise, the cmdlets enable you to specify such things as storage limits and expiration periods, as well as pointers to internal and external URLs where users can obtain conferencing help and resources.

  When you install Skype for Business Server, the system provides you with a single collection of conferencing configuration settings (the global collection).
  If you need to create custom settings for a site or service, you can do so using the `New-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet.
  After these custom settings have been created, you can modify any of them (or modify the global collection) by using the `Set-CsConferencingConfiguration` cmdlet.
