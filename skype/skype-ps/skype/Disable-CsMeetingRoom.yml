### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Disables a Skype for Business Server meeting room.
  A meeting room is a conferencing device designed to address video conferencing and collaboration scenarios in small conference rooms.
  When you disable a meeting room object you remove all the Skype for Business Server-specific Active Directory attributes assigned to the user account that represents the meeting room.
  However, the Active Directory user account itself is not deleted.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.

  **Note**: This cmdlet is not supported for managing Microsoft Teams Rooms. You must use the methods described in the [Microsoft Teams Rooms](/microsoftteams/rooms) documentation to manage Microsoft Teams Rooms.

    Get-CsMeetingRoom | Disable-CsMeetingRoom
  description: |-
    In Example 2, all the meeting rooms currently in use in the organization are disabled.
    To do this, the Get-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet is first used to retrieve a collection of all the meeting rooms.
    That collection is then piped to the Disable-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet, which disables each meeting room in the collection.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Indicates the Identity of the user account to be configured as a meeting room.
    Identities are typically specified by using one of four formats: 1) the user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (for example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).

    You can also reference a user account by using the user's Active Directory distinguished name.

    You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
    For example, the Identity "* Smith" returns all the user who have a display name that ends with the string value " Smith".

  In Skype for Business Server 2015, meeting rooms are self-contained computer appliances that are installed in conference rooms and supply advanced meeting capabilities such as:

  - One touch meeting join experience
  - Multi-view video gallery
  - Touch-enabled white-boarding on the front of room screen
  - Calendar integration to provide access to scheduled meetings
  - Content sharing and switching

  In order to manage these new endpoint devices you must, among other things, create and enable an Exchange resource mailbox account for the device, then enable that resource account for Skype for Business Server 2015.
  Note that, for Skype for Business Server 2015, there are no cmdlets for creating or removing meeting rooms.
  Instead, you use the Enable-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet to enable meeting rooms and the Disable-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet to disable meeting rooms.
  The resource account must already exist in order for you to enable the meeting room, and disabling a meeting room only removes that room from your collection of meeting rooms; it does not delete the resource mailbox account.

  To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

  `Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Disable-CsMeetingRoom"}`

  The functions carried out by the Disable-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
