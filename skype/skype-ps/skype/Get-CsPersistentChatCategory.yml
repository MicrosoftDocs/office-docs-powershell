    To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsPersistentChatCategory cmdlet to return a collection of all the Persistent Chat categories.
    This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those categories where the Invites property is set to False ($False).

    To do this, the Get-CsPersistentChatCategory cmdlet is first used to return a collection of all the Persistent Chat categories.

  The Persistent Chat serviceprovides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
  Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
  Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

  Persistent Chat categories provide a way for administrators to organize, and manage, Persistent Chat chat rooms.
  Categories provide a way for administrators to group related chat rooms; for example, all chat rooms used by the finance department can be grouped in the same category.
  Likewise, categories provide a way for administrators to manage permissions to these rooms, dictating which users are allowed access to the rooms, which users are denied access to the rooms, and which users are allowed to create new chat rooms within the category.

  Note that all chat rooms must belong to a category; you cannot create a chat room without assigning that room to a category.
  That means that you must create at least one category before you can add any chat rooms to your Persistent Chat implementation.

  To view Persistent Chat categories in Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click Persistent Chat and then click Category.
