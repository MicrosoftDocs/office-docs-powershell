description: |-
  When you create a dial-in conferencing Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), those URIs are assigned unique SIP addresses.
  However, SIP addresses are difficult to translate to devices that are not SIP-aware; for example, a public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephone can't translate a SIP address.
  Because of that, Skype for Business Server uses conference directories as a way to help these devices locate, and connect to, dial-in conferences.
  This is done by creating a SIP conference directory that is associated with each dial-in conferencing URI, and is identified by an integer value rather than a SIP URI.
  PSTN telephones and other devices can then use these numbers (rather than a SIP URI) when connecting to conferences; the directory number is included in the PSTN conference identification users enter when connecting to a dial-in conference.

  New conference directories can be created by calling the New-CsConferenceDirectory cmdlet.
