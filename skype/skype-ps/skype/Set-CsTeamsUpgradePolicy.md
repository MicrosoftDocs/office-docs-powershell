# Set-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy

## SYNOPSIS

In on-premises deployments of Skype for Business Server, TeamsUpgradePolicy enables administrators to control whether users see a notification in their Skype for Business client of a pending upgrade to Teams. In addition, when this policy is assigned to a user, administrators can optionally have Win32 versions of Skype for Business clients silently download the Teams app based on the value of TeamsUpgradeConfiguration.

## SYNTAX

### Identity (Default)

```
Set-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy [-Tenant <Guid>] [-Description <String>] [-NotifySfbUsers <Boolean>]
 [[-Identity] <XdsIdentity>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Instance

```
Set-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy [-Tenant <Guid>] [-Description <String>] [-NotifySfbUsers <Boolean>]
 [-Instance <PSObject>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**NOTE**: This cmdlet is only relevant for Skype for Business Server 2019. It does not apply for Skype for Business Online.

In on-premises deployments of Skype for Business Server, TeamsUpgradePolicy enables administrators to control whether users see a notification of a pending upgrade to Teams in their Skype for Business client. The Set-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy lets the administrator modify an existing instance of TeamsUpgradePolicy for users homed in Skype for Business on-premises. Notifications are enabled by the boolean parameter NotifySfBUsers.

For users with Win32 versions of Skype for Business, if DownloadTeams=true in TeamsUpgradeConfiguration, users who are assigned an instance of TeamsUpgradePolicy with NotifySfBUsers=true will have Teams automatically downloaded in the background.

Notes:

- Instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy created in on-premises will not apply to any users that are already homed online.
- Office 365 already provides built-in instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy, so there is no Set-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy cmdlet for the online environment by design.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -Identity Site:Redmond1 -NotifySfbUsers $false
```

This disables notifications for users in the Redmond1 site.
