## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet modifies an existing voice policy.
Voice policies are used to manage such Enterprise Voice-related features as simultaneous ringing (the ability to have a second phone ring each time someone calls your office phone) and call forwarding.
Use this cmdlet to change the settings that enable and disable many of these features.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsVoicePolicy UserVoicePolicy2 -AllowSimulRing $false -PstnUsages @{remove="Local"}
```

This example sets the AllowSimulRing property to False for the per-user policy UserVoicePolicy2, meaning any users assigned this policy are not enabled for simultaneous ring, a feature that determines whether a second phone (such as a mobile phone) can be set to ring every time the user's office phone rings.
This command also removes "Local" from the list of PSTN usages for this policy.
(Note that the Identity parameter is not explicitly specified.
The Identity parameter is a positional parameter, therefore if you put the identity value first in the list of parameters you don't need to explicitly state that it's the Identity.)


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
$a = Get-CsPstnUsage

Set-CsVoicePolicy -Identity site:Redmond -PstnUsages @{replace=$a.Usage}
```

This example modifies the voice policy for site Redmond so that all the PSTN usages defined for the organization are applied to this policy.
The first line in this example calls the `Get-CsPstnUsage` cmdlet to retrieve the global set of PSTN usages for the organization and save that set in the variable $a.
The second line calls the `Set-CsVoicePolicy` cmdlet to modify the voice policy for site Redmond.
A value is passed to the PstnUsages parameter to replace the current list of usages for the policy with the list contained in the global set of PSTN usages.
Note the syntax of the replace value: $a.Usage.
This refers to the Usage property of the PSTN usage settings, which contains the list of PSTN usages.

```

### -EnableBWPolicyOverride
Policies can be set to limit bandwidth and set various other properties relating to network configuration.
Setting this parameter to True will allow override of these policies.
In other words, if this parameter is set to True no bandwidth checks will be made, calls will go through regardless of the call admission control (CAC) settings.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)

Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableCallPark
The Call Park application allows a call to be held, or parked, at a certain number within a range of numbers for later retrieval.
Setting this parameter to True enables this application for users assigned this policy.
If this parameter is set to False, users assigned to this policy cannot park calls that have been dialed to their phone number.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableCallTransfer
Determines whether calls can be transferred to another number.
If this parameter is set to True, calls can be transferred; if the parameter is set to False, calls cannot be transferred.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableDelegation
Call delegation allows a user to answer calls for another user or make calls on the other user's behalf.
For example, a manager can set up call delegation so that all incoming calls ring both his or her phone and the phone of an administrator.
Setting this parameter to True allows users with this policy to set up call delegation.
Setting this parameter to False disables call delegation.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableMaliciousCallTracing
Malicious call tracing is a standard that is in place to trace calls that a user designates as malicious.
These calls can be traced even if caller ID is blocked.
The trace is available only to the proper authorities and not to the user.
Setting this property to True enables the ability to set a trace on malicious calls.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableTeamCall
Team Call allows a user to designate a group of other users whose phones will ring when that user's number is called.
This feature is useful in teams where, for example, anyone from a team can answer incoming calls from customers.
Setting this parameter to True enables this feature.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
A friendly name describing this policy.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PreventPSTNTollBypass
PSTN tolls are more commonly known as long-distance charges.
Organizations can sometimes bypass these tolls by implementing a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) solution that enables branch offices to connect via network calls.
Setting this parameter to True will send calls through PSTN and incur charges rather than going through the network and bypassing the tolls.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PstnUsages
A list of PSTN usages available to this policy.
The PSTN usage ties a voice policy to a phone route.

Any string value can be placed into this list, as long as the value exists in the current global list of PSTN usages.
(Duplicate strings are not allowed; all string must be unique.) The list of PSTN usages can be retrieved by calling the `Get-CsPstnUsage` cmdlet.

Keep in mind that if you use this parameter to remove all PSTN usages from the policy, users granted this policy will not be able to make outbound PSTN calls.

```yaml
Type: PSListModifier
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

### -EnableVoicemailEscapeTimer
When set to True, calls to an unanswered mobile device will be routed to the organization voicemail instead of the mobile device provider's voicemail.
If a call is answered "too soon" (that is, before the value configured for the PSTNVoicemailEscapeTimer property has elapsed) it will be assumed that the mobile device is not available and the call will be routed to the organization voicemail.

The default value is False.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False

Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PSTNVoicemailEscapeTimer
Amount of time (in milliseconds) used to determine whether or not a call has been answered "too soon." If a response is received within this time interval Skype for Business Server will assume that the mobile device is not available and automatically switch the call to the organization's voicemail.
If no response is received before the time interval is reached then the call will be allowed to proceed.

The default value is 1500 milliseconds.


```yaml
Type: Int64
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019
