- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkRegion -Identity NorthAmerica

    Example 2 retrieves the network regions with the Identity NorthAmerica.
    Because identities are unique, this command retrieves at most one network region.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkRegion | Where-Object {$_.CentralSite -eq "site:Redmond"}
  description: |-
    This example retrieves all network regions with identities that end with the string "America." This would retrieve regions with identities such as NorthAmerica, SouthAmerica, and CentralAmerica.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkRegion | Where-Object {$_.CentralSite -eq "site:Redmond"}
  description: |-
    This example retrieves all network regions associated with the central site Redmond.
    The command begins by calling the Get-CsNetworkRegion cmdlet, with no parameters, to retrieve a collection of all network regions defined for the Skype for Business Server deployment.
    This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
    The Where-Object cmdlet filters this collection to return only those items (network regions) where the CentralSite value is equal to (-eq) site:Redmond.

description: |-
  A network region interconnects various parts of a network across multiple geographic areas.
  Every network region must be associated with a central site.
  Use this cmdlet to retrieve information about one or more network regions, including the associated central site and settings that determine whether alternate paths are allowed for audio and video connections, and that associate the sites within the region with a media bypass configuration.
