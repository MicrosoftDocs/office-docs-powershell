examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Move-CsMeetingRoom -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Identity "Room 14"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 moves the meeting room with the display name "Room 14" to the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsMeetingRoom | Move-CsMeetingRoom -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    Example 2 moves all the meeting rooms in the organization to the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the meeting rooms configured for use in the organization.
    That collection is then piped to the Move-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet, which moves each meeting room in the collection to the new pool.

  In Skype for Business Server 2015, meeting rooms are self-contained computer appliances that are installed in conference rooms and supply advanced meeting capabilities such as:

  * One touch meeting join experience
  * Multi-view video gallery
  * Touch-enabled white-boarding on the front of room screen
  * Calendar integration to provide access to scheduled meetings
  * Content sharing and switching

  In order to manage these new endpoint devices you must, among other things, create and enable an Exchange resource mailbox account for the device, then enable that resource account for Skype for Business Server 2015.
  Note that, for Skype for Business Server 2015, there are no cmdlets for creating or removing meeting rooms.
  Instead, you use the Enable-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet to enable meeting rooms and the Disable-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet to disable meeting rooms.
  The resource account must already exist in order for you to enable the meeting room, and disabling a meeting room only removes that room from your collection of meeting rooms; it does not delete the resource mailbox account.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the Move-CsMeetingRoom cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
