# New-CsKerberosAccount

## SYNOPSIS

Creates a new Kerberos account used for Internet Information Services (IIS) authentication.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.



## SYNTAX

```
New-CsKerberosAccount [-ContainerDN <String>] -UserAccount <String> [-Force] [-Report <String>] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

In Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 and Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2, IIS ran under a standard user account.
This had the potential to cause issues: if that password expired you could lose your Web Services, an issue that was often difficult to diagnose.
To help avoid the issue of expiring passwords, Skype for Business Server enables you to create a computer account (for a computer that doesn't actually exist) that can serve as the authentication principal for all the computers in a site that are running IIS.
Because these accounts use the Kerberos authentication protocol, the accounts are referred to as Kerberos accounts, and the new authentication process is known as Kerberos web authentication.
This enables you to manage all your IIS servers by using a single account.

To run your servers under this authentication principal, you must first create a computer account by using the New-CsKerberosAccount cmdlet; this account is then assigned to one or more sites.
After the assignment has been made, the association between the account and the Skype for Business Server site is enabled by running the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet.
Among other things, this creates the required service principal name (SPN) in Active Directory Domain Services.
SPNs provide a way for client applications to locate a particular service.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```
New-CsKerberosAccount -UserAccount "litwareinc\kerberostest" -ContainerDN "cn=Computers,dc=litwareinc,dc=com"

New-CsKerberosAccountAssignment -UserAccount "litwareinc\kerberostest" -Identity "site:Redmond"

Enable-CsTopology
```

The commands shown in Example 1 create a new Kerberos account (litwareinc\kerberostest), and then assign that account to the Redmond site.
To do this, the first command in the example creates an account with the account name "litwareinc\kerberostest".
This account will be created in the Computers container in the Litwareinc.com domain.
After the account has been created, the second command uses the New-CsKerberosAccountAssignment cmdlet to assign that Kerberos account to the Redmond site.

After you make the new account assignment, the final command calls the Enable-CsTopology cmdlet in order to enable the changes.



## PARAMETERS

### -ContainerDN

Distinguished name of the Active Directory container where the new account is to be created.
For example: `-ContainerDN "ou=Finance,dc=litwareinc,dc=com".`
If this parameter is not specified, then the New-CsKerberosAccount cmdlet will create the new account in the Computers container in Active Directory.
