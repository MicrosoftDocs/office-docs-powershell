# Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Use the `Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy` cmdlet to get a list of all pre-configured policy instances related to Cloud Voicemail service.

## SYNTAX

### Identity (Default)
```
Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy [[-Identity] <string>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Filter
```
Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy [-Filter <string>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet retrieves information about one or more voicemail policies that have been configured for use in your organization. Voicemail policies are used by the organization to manage Voicemail-related features such as transcription.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy
```

In Example 1, the Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy cmdlet is called without any additional parameters; this returns a collection of all the voicemail policies configured for use in your organization.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -Identity TranscriptionDisabled
```

In Example 2, the Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy cmdlet is used to return the per-user voicemail policy that has an Identity TranscriptionDisabled. Because identities are unique, this command will never return more than one item.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -Filter "tag:*"
```

Example 3 uses the Filter parameter to return all the voicemail policies that have been configured at the per-user scope. The filter value "tag:*" tells the Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy cmdlet to return only those policies that have an Identity that begins with the string value "tag:".


## PARAMETERS
