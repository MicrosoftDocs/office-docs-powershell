examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Test-CsAddressBookService -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
  description: |-
    Example 1 tests the Address Book Download Web service for the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
    This command tests the Address Book Download Web service by using test users preconfigured for the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $cred1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

    Test-CsAddressBookService -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -UserCredential $cred1 -UserSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 also test the availability of the server that runs the Address Book Download Web service; in this case, however, the commands are running under the credentials for the user Ken Myer (litwareinc\kenmyer).
    To do this, the first command uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell credential object containing the name and password of the user Ken Myer.
    (Because the logon name -- litwareinc\kenmyer -- has been included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box only requires the administrator to enter the password for the Ken Myer account.) The resulting credential object is then stored in a variable named $cred1.

    In the second command, the `Test-CsAddressBookService` cmdlet is used to test the Address Book Download Web service for the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
    To run this command under Ken Myer's user credentials, the UserCredential parameter is included, along with the parameter value $cred1.
    In addition, Ken's SIP address must be supplied using the UserSipAddress parameter.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Test-CsAddressBookService -TargetUri https://atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/abs/handler -UserSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    Example 3 shows how you can test the Address Book Download Web service for `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
    To do this, the `Test-CsAddressBookService` cmdlet is called along with two parameters: TargetUri, which specifies the URI of the Address Book Download Web service and UserSipAddress, which contains the Windows PowerShell SIP address for the user account being used in the test.

  The `Test-CsAddressBookService` cmdlet is an example of a "synthetic transaction". Synthetic transactions are used in Skype for Business Server to verify that users are able to successfully complete common tasks such as logging on to the system, exchanging instant messages or making calls to a phone located on the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
  These tests can be conducted manually by an administrator, or they can be automatically run by an application such as Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (formerly Microsoft Operations Manager).

  Synthetic transactions are typically conducted in two different ways.
  Many administrators will use the CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration cmdlets to set up test users for each of their Registrar pools.
  These test users are a pair of users who have been preconfigured for use with synthetic transactions.
  (Typically these are test accounts and not accounts that belong to actual users.) With test users configured for a pool, administrators can run a synthetic transaction against that pool without having to specify the identities of (and supply the credentials for) the user accounts involved in the test.

  Alternatively, administrators can run a synthetic transaction by using actual user accounts.
  For example, if two users are unable to exchange instant messages, an administrator could run a synthetic transaction using those two user accounts (as opposed to a pair of test accounts), and then try to diagnose and resolve the problem.
  If you decide to conduct a synthetic transaction using actual user accounts, you will need to supply the logon names and passwords for each user.

  The `Test-CsAddressBookService` cmdlet provides a way for you to verify that a user can connect to the Address Book Download Web service.
  When run, the `Test-CsAddressBookService` cmdlet connects to the Address Book Download Web service on the specified pool and requests the location of the Address Book files.
  If the Address Book Download Web service supplies that location, the test is considered successful.
  If the request is denied, then the test is considered a failure.

  You can test the Address Book Download Web service in two different ways: by testing the service itself or by testing the associated Web service.
