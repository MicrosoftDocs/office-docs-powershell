# Remove-CsConfigurationStoreLocation

## SYNOPSIS
Removes the Active Directory service control point for the Central Management store.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsConfigurationStoreLocation [-GlobalSettingsDomainController <Fqdn>] [-Force] [-Report <String>]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Active Directory Domain Services uses service control points (SCP) to help computers locate services.
For example, when you install Skype for Business Server, an SCP is created that provides location information for the Central Management store used to maintain Skype for Business Server data.
Computers that need access to the database connect to Active Directory and use the information contained in the SCP to help them locate the correct computer and the correct instance of SQL Server.

As noted, when you install Skype for Business Server, an SCP for the Central Management store is automatically created for you.
Typically, you do not want to delete that SCP; if you do, computers will not be able to locate the database.
However, there might be times (perhaps when troubleshooting a problem) when you will need to delete the SCP.
To do that, use the `Remove-CsConfigurationStoreLocation` cmdlet.
After the SCP has been deleted, you can recreate it (or create a new service control point) by using the `Set-CsConfigurationStoreLocation` cmdlet.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Remove-CsConfigurationStoreLocation
```

The command shown in Example 1 removes the Active Directory service control point for the Central Management store.
To restore this SCP (or to create a new SCP), you must run the `Set-CsConfigurationStoreLocation` cmdlet.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Remove-CsConfigurationStoreLocation -Report C:\Logs\Store_Location.html
```

Example 2 also removes the Active Directory service control point for the Central Management store.
In addition to deleting the SCP, this command records information about the success (or failure) of the operation to the log file C:\Logs\Store_Location.html.
To create this log file, the command uses the Report parameter followed by the path to the log file where information should be recorded.
If this file already exists, the contents will be overwritten when the command runs.
If the file does not exist, it will be created when the command runs.
