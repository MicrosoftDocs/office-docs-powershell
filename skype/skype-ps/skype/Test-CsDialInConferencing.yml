  code: |-
    Test-CsDialInConferencing -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
  description: |-
    Example 1 verifies that a preconfigured test user can take part in dial-in conferencing on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    This command will work only if test users have been defined for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    If they have, then the command will determine whether or not the first test user is able to log on to Skype for Business Server.

    If test users have not been defined, then the command will fail because it will not know which user to log on as.
    If you have not defined test users for a pool, then you must include the UserCredential parameter and the credentials of the user that the command should employ when trying to log on.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $cred1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"

    Test-CsDialInConferencing -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -UserSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -UserCredential $cred1
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 test the ability of a specific user (litwareinc\pilar) to take part in dial-in conferencing on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell credential object containing the name and password of the user Pilar Ackerman.
    (Because the logon name -litwareinc\pilar -- has been included as a parameter, the administrator only has to enter the password for the Pilar Ackerman account in the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box.) The resulting credentials object is then stored in a variable named $cred1.

    The second command then checks to see if the user Pilar Ackerman can log on to the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com and take part in a dial-in conference.
    To carry out this task, the `Test-CsDialInConferencing` cmdlet is called, along with three parameters: TargetFqdn (the FQDN of the Registrar pool); UserCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing Pilar Ackerman's user credentials); and UserSipAddress (the SIP address corresponding to the supplied user credentials).

description: |-
  The `Test-CsDialInConferencing` cmdlet is an example of a Skype for Business Server "synthetic transaction." Synthetic transactions are used in Skype for Business Server to verify that users are able to successfully complete common tasks such as logging on to the system, exchanging instant messages, or making calls to a phone located on the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
  These tests can be conducted manually by an administrator, or they can be automatically run by an application such as Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (formerly Microsoft Operations Manager).

  Synthetic transactions are typically conducted in two different ways.
  Many administrators will use the `CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration` cmdlets to set up test users for each of their Registrar pools.
  These test users are a pair of users who have been preconfigured for use with synthetic transactions.
  (Typically these are test accounts and not accounts that belong to actual users.) With test users configured for a pool, administrators can simply run a synthetic transaction against that pool without having to specify the identities of (and supply the credentials for) the user accounts involved in the test.

  Alternatively, administrators can run a synthetic transaction using actual user accounts.
  For example, if two users are unable to exchange instant messages, an administrator could run a synthetic transaction using the two user accounts in question (as opposed to a pair of test accounts) and try to diagnose and resolve the problem.
  If you decide to conduct a synthetic transaction using actual user accounts, you will need to supply the logon names and passwords for each user.

  The `Test-CsDialInConferencing` cmdlet works by attempting to log a test user onto the system.
  (If you are using test users, the `Test-CsDialInConferencing` cmdlet will use the first test account configured for that pool.) If logon succeeds, the cmdlet will then use the user's credentials and permissions to try the available dial-in conferencing access numbers.
  The success or failure of each dial-in attempt will be noted, then the test user will be logged off from Skype for Business Server.

  The `Test-CsDialInConferencing` cmdlet only verifies that the appropriate connections can be made.
  The cmdlet does not actually make any phone calls or create any dial-in conferences that other users can join.
