examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkRegionLink
  description: |-
    Example 1 retrieves all network region links defined within a Skype for Business Server 2015 deployment.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkRegionLink -Identity NA_EMEA
  description: |-
    Example 2 retrieves information about (at most) one network region link, the link with the Identity NA_EMEA.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkRegionLink -Filter *EMEA*
  description: |-
    In this example we use the Filter parameter to retrieve all network region links with the string EMEA in the name (Identity) of the link.
    Notice the * characters, one before the string EMEA and one after.
    This means any character or characters can precede or follow the string; the string EMEA simply must be included in the Identity somewhere.
    This will retrieve links with names such as NA_EMEA, EMEA_APAC, and EMEA2_SA.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkRegionLink | Where-Object {$_.NetworkRegionID1 -eq "EMEA" -or $_.NetworkRegionID2 -eq "EMEA"}
  description: |-
    This example retrieves all network region links that include EMEA as one of the two regions being linked.
    The example begins by calling the Get-CsNetworkRegionLink cmdlet with no parameters, which will retrieve all region links.
    This collection of links is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
    The Where-Object cmdlet looks through each member of the collection one-by-one, checking the values of the NetworkRegionID1 and NetworkRegionID2 properties.
    If either of these properties is equal to EMEA--in other words if either NetworkRegionID1 is equal to (-eq) EMEA or (-or) NetworkRegionID2 is equal to (-eq) EMEA--then we want to keep that item in the collection and display it.

  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The unique identifier of the network region link you want to retrieve.
    Network region links are created only at the global scope, so this identifier does not need to specify a scope.
    Instead, it contains a string that is a unique name that identifies that link.
    (Note that this value is the same as the NetworkRegionLinkID.)
