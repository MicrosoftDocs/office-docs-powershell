### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet

  Removes an existing Persistent Chat category.
  A Persistent Chat category represents a collection of Persistent Chat chat rooms and each chat room must be associated with a category.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.
  Note that categories cannot be removed unless they are empty (that is, all the rooms within that category must be removed before you can remove the category).

examples:

  code: |-
    Remove-CsPersistentChatCategory -Identity "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com\helpdesk"

    The command shown in Example 1 removes the Persistent Chat category that has the Identity `"atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com\helpdesk"`.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsPersistentChatCategory | Remove-CsPersistentChatCategory
  description: |-
    In Example 2, all the Persistent Chat categories currently in use in the organization are removed.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsPersistentChatCategory` cmdlet to retrieve a collection of all the Persistent Chat categories.
    This collection is piped to the `Remove-CsPersistentChatCategory` cmdlet, which then deletes each category in the collection.

  The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
  Conversations can be based around specific topics and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
  Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

  Persistent Chat categories provide a way for administrators to organize and manage, Persistent Chat chat rooms.
  Categories provide a way for administrators to group related chat rooms; for example, all chat rooms used by the finance department can be grouped in the same category.
  Likewise, categories provide a way for administrators to manage permissions to these rooms, dictating which users are allowed access to the rooms, which users are denied access to the rooms and which users are allowed to create new chat rooms within the category.

  Note that all chat rooms must belong to a category; you cannot create a chat room without assigning that room to a category.
  That means that you must create at least one category before you can add any chat rooms to your Persistent Chat implementation.

  The `Remove-CsPersistentChatCategory` cmdlet provides a way to remove Persistent Chat categories.
  Keep in mind that categories cannot be removed unless they are empty.
  That means that all the rooms within that category must be removed before you can remove the category itself.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: To remove a Persistent Chat category using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click Persistent Chat and then click Category.
  Select the category to be removed, click Edit and then click Delete.
