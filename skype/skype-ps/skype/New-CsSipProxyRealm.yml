  code: |-
    $x = New-CsSipProxyUseDefault

    $y = New-CsSipProxyRealm -RealmChoice $x
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 1 assign the default realm (SIP Communications Service) to a variable named $y.
    To do this, the first command calls the New-CsSipProxyUseDefault cmdlet in order to create a SipProxy.UseDefault object; this object is stored in a variable named $x.

    In the second command, $x is used as the parameter value for the New-CsSipProxyRealm cmdlet and the RealmChoice parameter.
    In turn, this creates a new proxy realm object that is stored in a variable named $y.

  code: |-
    $x = New-CsSipProxyCustom -CustomValue "Litwareinc Communications Service"

    $y = New-CsSipProxyRealm -RealmChoice $x
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 assign a custom realm (Litwareinc Communications Service) to a variable named $y.
    To do this, the first command calls the New-CsSipProxyCustom cmdlet in order to create a SipProxy.Custom object; this object (which uses the CustomValue Litwareinc Communications Service) is stored in a variable named $x.

    In the second command, $x is used, along with the New-CsSipProxyRealm cmdlet and the RealmChoice parameter, to create a new custom realm object.

  Proxy servers provide a way for users outside your internal network to access resources on your internal network.
  Each proxy server must be associated with a realm; realms (also known as protection domains) indicate where a user's logon credentials should be processed.
  By default, Skype for Business Server uses SIP Communications Service as its default realm; however, it is possible to change the realm used by a proxy server.
  The New-CsSipProxyUseDefault cmdlet and the New-CsSipProxyCustom cmdlet provide a way for you to change the realm used by a proxy server.
  These changes can also be made by using the New-CsSipProxyRealm cmdlet.
  However, because this cmdlet requires an additional step you might want to use the other two cmdlets any time you need to change the realm used by a proxy server.
