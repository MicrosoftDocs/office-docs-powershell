# Remove-CsConferenceDirectory

## SYNOPSIS
Removes an existing conference directory.
Conference directories are used to help dial-in conferencing users locate conference information.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsConferenceDirectory [-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
When you create a dial-in conferencing Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) those URIs are assigned unique SIP addresses.
However, SIP addresses are difficult to translate to devices that are not SIP-aware; for example, a public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephone can't translate a SIP address.
Because of that, Skype for Business Server uses conference directories as a way to help these devices locate, and connect to, dial-in conferences.
This is done by creating a SIP conference directory that is associated with each dial-in conferencing URI and is identified by an integer value rather than a SIP URI.
PSTN telephones and other devices can then use these numbers (rather than a SIP URI) when connecting to conferences; the directory number is included in the PSTN conference identification users enter when connecting to a dial-in conference.

Conference directories are created by using the `New-CsConferenceDirectory` cmdlet.
Occasionally, you might need to delete one or more of these directories; for example, you might need to decommission the pool where the directories were hosted.
Conference directories can be removed by calling the `Remove-CsConferenceDirectory` cmdlet.
Note that if you need to move a directory from one pool to another, you can do so by calling the `Move-CsConferenceDirectory` cmdlet.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Remove-CsConferenceDirectory -Identity 2
```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes the conference directory with the Identity 2.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Get-CsConferenceDirectory | Where-Object {$_.ServiceID -match "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} | Remove-CsConferenceDirectory
```

Example 2 deletes all the conference directories found on the service UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsConferenceDirectory` cmdlet without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the conference directories currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those directories hosted on the service UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In turn, that filtered collection is piped to and deleted by, the `Remove-CsConferenceDirectory` cmdlet.
