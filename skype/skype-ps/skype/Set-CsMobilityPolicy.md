# Set-CsMobilityPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Modifies an existing mobility policy.
Mobility policies determine whether or not a user can use Skype for Business Mobile.
These policies also manage a user's ability to employ Call via Work, a feature that enables users to make and receive phone calls on their mobile phone by using their work phone number instead of their mobile phone number.
Mobility policies can also be used to require Wi-Fi connections when making or receiving calls.
This cmdlet was introduced in the cumulative update for Lync Server 2010: November 2011.

## DESCRIPTION
Skype for Business Mobile is a client application that enables users to run Skype for Business on their mobile phones.
Call via Work provides a way for users to make calls on their mobile phone and yet have it appear as though the call originated from their work phone number instead of their mobile phone number.
Users who have been enabled for Call via Work can achieve this either by dialing directly from their mobile phone or by using the dial-out conferencing option.
With dial-out conferencing, a user effectively asks the Skype for Business Server Mobility Service server to make a call for them.
The server will set up the call, and then call the user back on their mobile phone.
After the user has answered, the server will then dial the party being called.
Both of these capabilities can be managed by using mobility policies.

With Skype for Business Server mobile devices can make or receive phone calls by using either the standard cellular phone network
or by using Wi-Fi connections.
Mobility policies can be used to require Wi-Fi connections and to prevent calls over the cellular network.

These policies can be modified at any time by using the `Set-CsMobilityPolicy` cmdlet.

Note that two different properties must be configured in order to enable Call via Work.
The first property, EnableOutsideVoice, determines whether or not Call via Work is enabled; the second, EnableMobility, determines whether or not users are allowed to use Skype for Business Mobile.
Both of these properties must be set to true before a user can take advantage of Call via Work.
If EnableMobility is set to True and EnableOutsideVoice is set to False, the user can run Skype for Business Server Mobile but will not be able to use Call via Work.
If EnableMobility is set to False and EnableOutsideVoice is set to True the user will not be able to run Skype for Business Mobile.
In turn, that means that the user will not be able to use Call via Work, regardless of the value of the EnableOutsideVoice property.

To use Call via Work, users must be managed by a voice policy that allows simultaneous ringing.

The following parameters are not applicable to Skype for Business Online: AllowAutomaticPstnFallback, AllowCustomerExperienceImprovementProgram, AllowExchangeConnectivity, AllowSaveCallLogs, AsJob, Description, EncryptAppData, Force, Identity, Instance, PipelineVariable, RequireIntune, Tenant, VoiceSettings

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsMobilityPolicy -Identity "site:Redmond" -EnableOutsideVoice $False
```

In Example 1, Call via Work is disabled in the mobility policy assigned to the Redmond site.
This is done by setting the EnableOutsideVoice property to False.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsMobilityPolicy -Filter "tag:*" | Set-CsMobilityPolicy -EnableOutsideVoice $False
```

The command shown in Example 2 disables Call via Work for all the mobility policies configured at the per-user scope.
To carry out this task, the command first calls the `Get-CsMobilityPolicy` cmdlet along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "tag:*" limits the returned data to policies that have an Identity that begins with the string value "tag:".
That filtered collection of policies is then piped to the `Set-CsMobilityPolicy` cmdlet, which takes each policy in the collection and sets the EnableOutsideVoice property to False.


### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsMobilityPolicy | Where-Object {$_.Description -eq $Null} | Set-CsMobilityPolicy -Description "Policy owner: kenmyer@litwareinc.com"
```

In Example 3, a new description is added to any mobility policy property that does not currently have a description.
To do this, the first uses the `Get-CsMobilityPolicy` cmdlet to return a collection of all the mobility policies currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which selects only those policies where the Description property is equal to (-eq) a null value.
That filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsMobilityPolicy` cmdlet, which sets the Description property for each policy to the string value "Policy owner: kenmyer@litwareinc.com".
