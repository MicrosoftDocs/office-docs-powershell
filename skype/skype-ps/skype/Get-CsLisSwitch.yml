### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Retrieves one or more network switches from the location configuration database.
  Each switch can be associated with a location, in which case this cmdlet will also retrieve the location information of the switches.
  This location association is used in an Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) Enterprise Voice implementation to notify an emergency services operator of the caller's location.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

  code: |-
    Get-CsLisSwitch | Where-Object {$_.ChassisID -eq "99-99-99-99-99-99"}
  description: |-
    This example retrieves all information for all switches that have a ChassisID equal to 99-99-99-99-99-99.
    Because ChassisIDs must be unique, this command will retrieve, at most, one switch location.
    The command begins by calling the Get-CsLisSwitch cmdlet to retrieve all switch location associations.
    This collection of switch locations is piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
    The Where-Object cmdlet checks the ChassisID property of each item in the collection and returns the item with the ChassisID value 99-99-99-99-99-99.

  code: |-
    Get-CsLisSwitch | Where-Object {$_.City -eq "Redmond"}
  description: |-
    This example retrieves all information for all switches that have been associated with a location in the city of Redmond.
    The command begins by calling the Get-CsLisSwitch cmdlet to retrieve all switch location associations.
    This collection of switch locations is piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
    The Where-Object cmdlet checks the City property of each item in the collection to determine whether the value is equal to (-eq) Redmond.

  Enhanced 9-1-1 allows an emergency operator to identify the location of a caller without having to ask the caller for that information.
  In the case where a caller is calling from a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connection, that information must be extracted based on various connection factors.
  The VoIP administrator must configure a location map (called a wiremap) that will determine a caller's location.
  This cmdlet retrieves information on associations between physical locations and the network switch through which the client is connected.

  This cmdlet does not take any parameters (other than the Windows PowerShell common parameters).
  The cmdlet will retrieve all instances of switch to location mappings.
  To narrow down the information retrieved you must pipe the output from this cmdlet to another Windows PowerShell cmdlet such as the Where-Object cmdlet or the Select-Object cmdlet.
