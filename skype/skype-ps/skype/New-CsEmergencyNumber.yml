    For each emergency number, you can specify zero or more emergency dial masks. A dial mask is a number that you want to translate into the value of the emergency dial number value when it is dialed. For example, assume you enter a value of 212 in this field and the emergency dial number field has a value of 911. When a user dials 212, the number will be translated to 911. This allows for alternate emergency numbers to be dialed and still have the call reach emergency services (for example, if someone from a country or region with a different emergency number attempts to dial that country or region's number rather than the number for the country or region they are currently in). You can define multiple emergency dial masks by separating the values with semicolons. For example, 212;414. The string limit for a dial mask is 100 characters. Each character must be a digit 0 through 9.
