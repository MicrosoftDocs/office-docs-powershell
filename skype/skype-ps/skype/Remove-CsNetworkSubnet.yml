- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkSubnet | Where-Object {$_.NetworkSiteID -eq "Vancouver"} | Remove-CsNetworkSubnet
  description: |-
    Example 2 removes all subnets associated with the Vancouver site.
    To do this, we begin by calling the `Get-CsNetworkSubnet` cmdlet.
    This will retrieve a collection of all subnets defined within the Skype for Business Server deployment.
    This collection of subnets is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet.
    The `Where-Object` cmdlet takes that collection and narrows it down to only those subnets with a NetworkSiteID equal to (-eq) Vancouver.
    Now that the collection consists only of subnets associated with the Vancouver site, we pipe the collection to the `Remove-CsNetworkSubnet` cmdlet, which removes every item in the collection.
