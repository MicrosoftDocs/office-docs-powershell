    `$TestOutput.ToHTML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.html`

    To save the information stored in the logger variable to an XML file, use a command similar to this:

    `$TestOutput.ToXML() \> C:\Logs\TestOutput.xml`

  The Apple Push Notification Service and the Skype for Business Server Push Notification Service enable users running Skype for Business on their Apple iPhone or Windows Phone to receive notifications about Skype for Business events even when the application is suspended or running in the background.
  For example, users can receive notice for events such as these:

  - Invitations to a new instant messaging session or conference
  - New instant messages
  - New voice mail

  Without the push notification service, users would receive these notices only when Skype for Business was in the foreground and serving as the active application.

  The `Test-CsMcxPushNotification` cmdlet provides a way for administrators to verify that the push notification service is working.
  When using this cmdlet, make sure that the AccessEdgeFqdn parameter points to the internal edge of the proxy server to which push notification traffic is directed.
