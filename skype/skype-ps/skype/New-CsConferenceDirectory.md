# New-CsConferenceDirectory

## SYNOPSIS

Creates a new conference directory for use in your organization.
Conference directories are used to help dial-in conferencing users locate conference information.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server.



## SYNTAX

```
New-CsConferenceDirectory [-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity> -HomePool <String> [-Force] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

When you create a dial-in conferencing Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), those URIs are assigned unique SIP addresses.
However, SIP addresses are difficult to translate to devices that are not SIP-aware; for example, a public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephone can't translate a SIP address.
Because of that, Skype for Business Server uses conference directories as a way to help these devices locate, and connect to, dial-in conferences.
This is done by creating a SIP conference directory that is associated with each dial-in conferencing URI, and is identified by an integer value rather than a SIP URI.
PSTN telephones and other devices can then use these numbers (rather than a SIP URI) when connecting to conferences; the directory number is included in the PSTN conference identification users enter when connecting to a dial-in conference.

New conference directories can be created by calling the New-CsConferenceDirectory cmdlet.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

New-CsConferenceDirectory -Identity 42 -HomePool "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

Creates a new conference directory with the Identity 42.
This directory will be hosted on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique numeric identifier for the new conference directory.
Identities can be any integer value between 0 and 9999 inclusive; however, Identities must be unique.
(For example, you cannot have two directories with the Identity 575.) You do not need to follow a numeric order when creating new directories.
For example, you can create a directory with the Identity 999 followed by a directory with the Identity 2 followed by a directory with the Identity 438, and so on.
