  The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
  Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
  Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

  If you are currently running Lync Server 2010, you can migrate your current Group Chat implementation by using the Export-CsPersistentChatData cmdlet to export your existing Group Chat configuration settings, then use the Import-CsPersistentChatData cmdlet to migrate that information to Lync Server 2013 and the Persistent Chat service.
  Note that the Export-CsPersistentChatData cmdlet gives you the option of importing all your Group Chat settings and data or only a portion of your Group Chat settings and data; for example, you can export (and then import) your Group Chat categories and chat rooms without exporting all the content associated with those categories and chat rooms.

  Although primarily intended for migration purposes, the CsPersistentChatData cmdlets can also be used to manage Persistent Chat data on Skype for Business Server.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the Import-CsPersistentChatData cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
