    Remove-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint -BSSID 99-99-99-99-99-99
  description: |-
    Example 1 removes the LIS WAP location with the BSSID 99-99-99-99-99-99.

    If this WAP was associated with a location, that location will not be removed, only the WAP will be removed from the location mapping.

  code: |-
    Get-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint | Where-Object {$_.Location -like "*Bldg30*"} | Remove-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint
  description: |-
    This example removes all WAPs in building 30.
    The example begins with a call to the `Get-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint` cmdlet, which returns a collection of all WAPs.
    This collection is piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which finds the items in that collection that have a Location property that contains the string Bldg30 anywhere in the value; in other words, a Location that is like (-like) Bldg30.
    Finally, we pipe this collection of WAPs in building 30 to the `Remove-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint` cmdlet, which removes everything in that collection.

    Note that, as in Example 1, no locations are removed from the location configuration database, only the WAPs that reference those locations are removed.

  Enhanced 9-1-1 allows an emergency operator to identify the location of a caller without having to ask the caller for that information.
  In the case where a caller is calling from a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connection, that information must be extracted based on various connection factors.
  The VoIP administrator must configure a location map (called a wiremap) that will determine a caller's location.
  This cmdlet removes a WAP from the location configuration database.
  Removing the WAP will not remove the location associated with that WAP.
  Use the `Remove-CsLisLocation` cmdlet to remove a location.

  If you attempt to remove a WAP that does not exist, no action will be taken and you will not receive an error or a warning message.
