examples:
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsExUmContact -SipAddress sip:exumsa1@fabrikam.com -RegistrarPool RedmondPool.litwareinc.com -OU "OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com" -DisplayNumber 2065554567
  description: |-
    This example calls the New-CsExUmContact cmdlet to create a new Exchange UM Active Directory contact object.
    To create a new contact you must supply the SIP address (in this example, sip:exumsa1@fabrikam.com) of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access.
    In addition, you must supply the name of the pool where the Skype for Business Server Registrar service is running (RedmondPool.litwareinc.com), the OU where this information will be stored (OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com), and the phone number of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access (2065554567).
    Because we didn't specifically set the AutoAttendant parameter, the default of False will be applied and this contact object will be assumed to be a Subscriber Access contact.

- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsExUmContact -SipAddress sip:exumaa1@fabrikam.com -RegistrarPool RedmondPool.litwareinc.com -OU "OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com" -DisplayNumber 2065559876 -AutoAttendant $True
  description: |-
    This example is similar to Example 1 in that it calls the New-CsExUmContact cmdlet to create a new Exchange UM contact.
    We again create a new Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access contact, this time with the SIP address sip:exumaa1@fabrikam.com.
    We then supply the name of the pool where the Skype for Business Server Registrar service is running (RedmondPool.litwareinc.com), the OU where this information will be stored (OU=ExUmContacts,DC=litwareinc,DC=com), and the phone number of the Auto Attendant or Subscriber Access (2065554567).
    The difference in this example is that we set the optional parameter AutoAttendant to True ($True) to show that this object is, in fact, an Auto Attendant contact.

description: |-
  Skype for Business Server works with Exchange UM to provide several voice-related capabilities, including Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access.
  When Exchange UM is provided as a hosted service (rather than on-premises), contact objects must be created with this cmdlet to apply the Auto Attendant and Subscriber Access functionality.
  These objects are created by calling the New-CsExUmContact cmdlet.

  A contact object created with this cmdlet will not be available for use within the system until a hosted voice mail policy has been applied that configures routing for the contact.
  You can retrieve hosted voice mail policies by calling the Get-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy cmdlet.
  From the policies retrieved you can determine whether an appropriate global or site policy exists, or if a per-user policy exists that needs to be granted to this contact.
