  code: |-
    Get-CsUser | ForEach-Object {$_.DisplayName; Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment -Identity $_.SamAccountName}
  description: |-
    Example 2 returns the RBAC roles for all of the users who have been enabled for Skype for Business Server.
    To do this, the command begins by calling the Get-CsUser cmdlet without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the users in the organization who have been enabled for Skype for Business Server.
    This data is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which loops through each user account in the collection and does the following: 1) echoes the user's display name to the screen; and 2) uses the Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment cmdlet to return the user's RBAC roles.
    The user account information must be piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet because the Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment cmdlet does not directly accept pipelined data.

  Role-based access control (RBAC) enables administrators to delegate control of specific management tasks for Skype for Business Server.
  For example, instead of granting your organization's help desk full administrator privileges you can give these employees very specific rights: the right to manage only user accounts; the right to manage only Enterprise Voice components; and the right to manage only archiving and Archiving Server.
  In addition, these rights can be limited in scope: one user can be given the right to manage Enterprise Voice, but only in the Redmond site; while another user can be given the right to manage user accounts, but only if those accounts are in the Finance organizational unit (OU).

  The Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment cmdlet provides a way for you to retrieve a list of the RBAC roles that have been assigned to a user.
