### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Removes one or more centralized logging configuration regions.
  Centralized logging provides a way for administrators to simultaneously enable or disable event tracing on multiple computers.
  Centralized logging regions are intended for use with Skype for Business Online.
module: SkypeForBusiness

    The `Remove-CsClsRegion` cmdlet accepts pipelined instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Settings.CentralizedLogging.Region#Decorated object.
outputs:
- name: <xref href=" " data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    None.
    Instead, the `Remove-CsClsRegion` cmdlet deletes existing instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Settings.CentralizedLogging.Region#Decorated object.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Remove-CsClsRegion -Identity "global/US"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 removes the centralized logging region that has the Identity global/US.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsClsRegion -Filter "global/*" | Remove-CsClsRegion
  description: |-
    In Example 2, all the centralized logging regions configured at the global scope are removed.
    To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsClsRegion` cmdlet along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "global/*" limits the returned data to regions configured at the global scope.
    These regions are then piped to, and deleted by, the `Remove-CsClsRegion` cmdlet.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsClsRegion | Where-Object {$_.SecurityGroupSuffix -eq "EMEA" | Remove-CsClsRegion
  description: |-
    Example 3 deletes all the centralized logging regions that have the security group suffix EMEA.
    To carry out this task, the command first calls the `Get-CsClsRegion` cmdlet without any parameters; this returns a collection of all the centralized logging regions configured for use in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those regions where the SecurityGroupSuffix property is equal to (-eq) EMEA.
    That subcollection of regions is then piped to the `Remove-CsClsRegion` cmdlet, which deletes each region in the subcollection.

  The centralized logging service (which replaces the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides a way for administrators to manage logging and tracing for all computers and pools running Skype for Business Server.
  Centralized logging enables administrators to stop, start and configure logging for one or more pools and computers by using a single command; for example, you can use one command to enable Address Book service logging on all your Address Book servers.
  This differs from the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools, which had to be individually managed (including individually stopped and started) on each server.
  In addition, the centralized logging service also provides a way for administrators to search trace logs from the command, using the Windows PowerShell command-line interface and the `Search-CsClsLogging` cmdlet.

  With Skype for Business Online, regions are used to determine which users have access to the personally-identifiable information that is written to the log files.
  Regions are created by using the `New-CsClsRegion` cmdlet and then are added to a collection of centralized logging configuration settings.
  Regions added to one of these collections can later be removed by using the `Remove-CsClsRegion` cmdlet.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Remove-CsClsRegion` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
