  The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a standard communications protocol (based on XML) used for sending messages across the Internet.
  XMPP was originally named Jabber, and is supported by a number of Internet messaging and communication applications, including Google Talk and Facebook Chat.

  In order for your users to be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with users on an XMPP network, that network must be configured as an XMPP allowed partner.
  (You must also assign your users an external access policy that allows XMPP access.) By design, your users will be allowed to communicate with users on any XMPP network that is listed on the allowed partners list.
  If you do not want users communicating with users from a given network then you must delete that network from the allowed partners list.

  To view information about your XMPP allowed partners in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click External User Access and then click XMPP Federated Partners.
