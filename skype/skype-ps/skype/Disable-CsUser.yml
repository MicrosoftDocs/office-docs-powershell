  code: |-
    Disable-CsUser -Identity "Ken Myer"

  code: |-
    Get-CsUser -LdapFilter "Department=Finance" | Disable-CsUser
  description: |-
    In Example 2, all the users in the Finance department have their Skype for Business Server 2015 accounts disabled.
    To carry out this task, the command first uses the Get-CsUser cmdlet and the LdapFilter parameter to return a collection of all the users who belong to the Finance department.
    That collection is then piped to the Disable-CsUser cmdlet, which disables each account in the collection.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsUser -UnassignedUser | Disable-CsUser
  description: |-
    In this example, all the user accounts not currently assigned to a Registrar pool are disabled.
    To do this, the Get-CsUser cmdlet is called, along with the UnassignedUser parameter.
    This parameter restricts the returned data to users who have valid user accounts but are not assigned to a Registrar pool.
    That collection is then piped to the Disable-CsUser cmdlet, which disables each account in the collection.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Indicates the Identity of the user account to be disabled.
    User Identities can be specified by using one of four formats: 1) the user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (for example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).
    You can also reference a user account by using the Active Directory distinguished name.

    You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard character when using the Display Name as the user Identity.
    For example, the Identity "* Smith" returns all the users who have a display name that ends with the string value " Smith".

uid: SkypeForBusiness.Disable-CsUser
name: Disable-CsUser
description: |-
  The Disable-CsUser cmdlet deletes all the attribute information related to Skype for Business Server from an Active Directory user account; this prevents the user from logging on to Skype for Business Server.

  When you run the Disable-CsUser cmdlet all the Skype for Business Server-related attributes are removed from an account, including the Identities of any per-user policies that have been assigned to that account.
  You can later re-enable the account by using the Enable-CsUser cmdlet.
  However, all the Skype for Business Server-related information (such as policy assignments) previously associated with that account will have to be re-created.

  If you want to prevent a user from logging on to Skype for Business Server, but do not want to lose all of their account information, use the Set-CsUser cmdlet instead.
  For details, see the Set-CsUser cmdlet help topic.

  After an account has been disabled with the Disable-CsUser cmdlet, the affected user will no longer be returned by the Get-CsUser cmdlet; that's because that user no longer has a valid Skype for Business Server account.
  To retrieve information for the disabled user account, use the Get-CsAdUser cmdlet.

  In addition, user data belonging to the deleted user account will be removed from the backend databases; for example, the user will be removed from Contacts lists in the organization, and any conferences scheduled by that user will be deleted.

  By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Disable-CsUser cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins.
  To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

  `Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Disable-CsUser"}`
