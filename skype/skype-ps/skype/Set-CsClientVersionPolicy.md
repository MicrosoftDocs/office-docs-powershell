# Set-CsClientVersionPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Modifies an existing client version policy.
Client version policies enable you to specify which clients (such as Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2) will be allowed to log on to your Skype for Business Server system.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

 [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-Tenant <Guid>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Instance
```
Set-CsClientVersionPolicy [-Instance <PSObject>] [-Description <String>] [-Rules <PSListModifier>] [-Force]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-Tenant <Guid>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Client version policies represent a collection of client version rules; in turn, client version rules are used to determine which client applications are allowed to log on to Skype for Business Server.
When a user attempts to log on to Skype for Business Server, his or her client application sends a SIP header to the server; this header includes detailed information about the application itself, including the software's major version, minor version and build number.
The version information included in the SIP header is then checked against a collection of client version rules to see if any rules apply to that particular application.
If such a rule exists, Skype for Business Server will then take the action specified by the rule.
For example, the rule might tell Skype for Business Server to allow the logon, to block it, or to allow the logon but then silently upgrade the client application to the latest version (for example, upgrade Communicator 2007 R2 to Skype for Business).

Client version policies, which can be applied at the global scope, the site scope, the service scope (Registrar service only), or the per-user scope, give you flexibility in determining which client applications can be used to access the system.
For example, you might want to prevent users from logging on to Skype for Business Server by using Communicator 2007 R2; that's because it does not support the same features and capabilities as Skype for Business.
However, due to hardware or software conflicts you might also have a group of users who cannot upgrade to Skype for Business.
In that case, you can create a separate rule -- and a separate client version policy -- that allows those users to log on from within Communicator 2007 R2.

Client version policies can be modified at any time; modifying a client version policy typically means adding new rules, deleting existing rules, or modifying the properties of an existing rule (for example, changing a rule action from Allow to Block).
These changes can be made by using the `Set-CsClientVersionPolicy` cmdlet.
However, you will probably find it easier to make these modifications by using the CsClientVersionPolicyRule cmdlet.

On the other hand, the `Set-CsClientVersionPolicy` cmdlet does provide a way for you to easily copy an entire set of rules from one client version policy to another.
For details, see the Examples section in this Help topic.

It's important to note that client version policies do not apply to federated users; instead, federated users are bound by the client version policies used in their own organization.
For example, suppose a federated user uses client A, a client allowed by the federated organization.
As long as the federated organization allows the use of client A, this user will be able to communicate with your organization using that client.
This will be true even if your client version policy blocks the use of client A.
Client version policies enforced in your organization do not override the client version policies used in a federated organization.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsClientVersionPolicy -Identity site:Redmond -Rules $Null

$x = Get-CsClientVersionPolicy -Identity site:Dublin | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Rules

Set-CsClientVersionPolicy -Identity site:Redmond -Rules $x
```

The commands shown in Example 1 copy all the client version rules from one client version policy to another.
To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Set-CsClientVersionPolicy` cmdlet to remove all the rules from the policy site:Redmond; this is done by setting the value of the Rules property to null.
After the rules have been deleted, the second command in the example uses the `Get-CsClientVersionPolicy` cmdlet to retrieve all the client version policy rules configured for the site:Dublin policy.
These rules are stored in a variable named $x.

In the final command, the `Set-CsClientVersionPolicy` cmdlet is invoked again, this time setting the Rules property of the Redmond policy to $x.
This effectively copies all the rules from the site:Dublin policy and adds them to the site:Redmond policy.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the policy to be modified.
To modify the global policy, use this syntax: `-Identity global`.
To modify a policy configured at the site scope, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity "site:Redmond"`.
To modify a policy configured at the service scope, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity "Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"`.
The Registrar service is the only service that can host a client version policy.

Per-user policies can also be modified by using this cmdlet.
To modify a per-user policy, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity "SalesDepartmentPolicy"`.

If this parameter is not included, then the `Set-CsClientVersionPolicy` cmdlet will modify the global policy.
