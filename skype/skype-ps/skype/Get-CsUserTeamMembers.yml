  The feature enables the use of SEFAUtil functionality in PowerShell. SEFAUtil (Secondary Extension Feature Activation) enables Skype server administrators and helpdesk agents to configure delegate-ringing, call-forwarding and Group Call Pickup settings on behalf of a Skype server user. This tool also allows administrators to query the call-routing settings that are published for a particular user.

  The cmdlets introduced in this feature can only be run by members of the following groups for On-prem deployments, per the access level specified below:

  - CsAdministrator - Get and Set for all cmdlets
  - CsVoiceAdministrator - Get and Set for all cmdlets
  - CsServerAdministrator - Get and Set for all cmdlets
  - CsHelpDesk - Get for all cmdlets

  Server auto-discovery needs to be enabled. There are no additional licensing requirements for use of the cmdlets.
