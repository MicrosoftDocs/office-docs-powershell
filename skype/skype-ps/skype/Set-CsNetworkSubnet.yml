- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsNetworkSubnet -Identity 172.11.15.0 -MaskBits 25 -NetworkSiteID Chicago
  description: |-
    This example modifies the subnet with the Identity (the Subnet ID) 172.11.15.0.
    The subnet is modified with a new MaskBits value (25) and a new NetworkSiteID (Chicago).

  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkSubnet | Where-Object {$_.NetworkSiteID -eq "Vancouver"} | Set-CsNetworkSubnet -NetworkSiteID Chicago
  description: |-
    Example 2 moves all subnets on the Vancouver site to the Chicago site.
    To do this, we begin by calling the `Get-CsNetworkSubnet` cmdlet.
    This will retrieve a collection of all subnets defined within the Skype for Business Server deployment.
    This collection of subnets is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet.
    The `Where-Object` cmdlet takes that collection and narrows it down to only those subnets with a NetworkSiteID equal to (-eq) Vancouver.
    Now that the collection consists only of subnets associated with the Vancouver site, we pipe the collection to the `Set-CsNetworkSubnet` cmdlet.
    We supply one parameter to the `Set-CsNetworkSubnet` cmdlet: NetworkSiteID.
    By passing the parameter a value of Chicago, we're instructing the `Set-CsNetworkSubnet` cmdlet to change the network site ID of every member of the collection to Chicago.
