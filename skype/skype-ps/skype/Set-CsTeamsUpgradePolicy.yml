### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  In on-premises deployments of Skype for Business Server, TeamsUpgradePolicy enables administrators to control whether users see a notification in their Skype for Business client of a pending upgrade to Teams. In addition, when this policy is assigned to a user, administrators can optionally have Win32 versions of Skype for Business clients silently download the Teams app based on the value of TeamsUpgradeConfiguration.

  **NOTE**: This cmdlet is only relevant for Skype for Business Server 2019. It does not apply for Skype for Business Online.

  In on-premises deployments of Skype for Business Server, TeamsUpgradePolicy enables administrators to control whether users see a notification of a pending upgrade to Teams in their Skype for Business client. The Set-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy lets the administrator modify an existing instance of TeamsUpgradePolicy for users homed in Skype for Business on-premises. Notifications are enabled by the boolean parameter NotifySfBUsers.

  For users with Win32 versions of Skype for Business, if DownloadTeams=true in TeamsUpgradeConfiguration, users who are assigned an instance of TeamsUpgradePolicy with NotifySfBUsers=true will have Teams automatically downloaded in the background.

  Notes:

  - Instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy created in on-premises will not apply to any users that are already homed online.
  - Office 365 already provides built-in instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy, so there is no Set-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy cmdlet for the online environment by design.
