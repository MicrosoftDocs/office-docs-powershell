# Get-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

The TeamsCallParkPolicy controls whether or not users are able to leverage the call park feature in Microsoft Teams.  Call park allows enterprise voice customers to place a call on hold and then perform a number of actions on that call: transfer to another department, retrieve via the same phone, or retrieve via a different Teams phone.  The Get-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy cmdlet returns the policies that are available for your organization.

NOTE: the call park feature is currently only available in the desktop and web clients.  Call Park functionality is currently completely disabled in mobile clients.
