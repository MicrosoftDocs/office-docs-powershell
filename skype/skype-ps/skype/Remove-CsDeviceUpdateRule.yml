- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Remove-CsDeviceUpdateRule -Identity service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/d5ce3c10-2588-420a-82ac-dc2d9b1222ff9
  description: |-
    Example 1 deletes the device update rule with the Identity service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/d5ce3c10-2588-420a-82ac-dc2d9b1222ff9.
    After the rule has been deleted, the corresponding firmware update will no longer be available for use.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsDeviceUpdateRule | Remove-CsDeviceUpdateRule
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 2 removes all the device update rules that have been configured for use in your organization.
    This is done by calling the `Get-CsDeviceUpdateRule` cmdlet (without any parameters) in order to return a collection of all the device update rules currently in use.
    That collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsDeviceUpdateRule` cmdlet, which, in turn, deletes each rule in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsDeviceUpdateRule -Filter service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com* | Remove-CsDeviceUpdateRule
  description: |-
    In Example 3, all the device update rules that have been imported to the service WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com are removed.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsDeviceUpdateRule` cmdlet and the Filter parameter to retrieve all the device update rules that have an Identity that begins with the string value "service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com".
    This collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsDeviceUpdateRule` cmdlet, which deletes each rule in that collection.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsDeviceUpdateRule | Where-Object {$_.Brand -eq "LG-Nortel"} | Remove-CsDeviceUpdateRule
  description: |-
    Example 4 deletes all the device update rules that have a Brand equal to "LG-Nortel".
    To do this, the cmdlet calls the `Get-CsDeviceUpdateRule` cmdlet without any parameters in order to retrieve a collection of all the device update rules in use in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which selects only those rules where the Brand is equal to "LG-Nortel".
    The filtered collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsDeviceUpdateRule` cmdlet, which removes each rule in the collection.

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Unique identifier for the device update rule.
    The Identity of a device update rule is composed of two parts: The service scope where the rule has been applied (for example, service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com) and the globally unique identifier (GUID) that was pre-assigned to the rule (for example, d5ce3c10-2588-420a-82ac-dc2d9b1222ff9).
    Based on this, the Identity for a given device update rule will look something like this: "service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/d5ce3c10-2588-420a-82ac-dc2d9b1222ff9".

    Wildcards are not allowed when specifying an Identity.

  Skype for Business Server uses device update rules as a way to provide firmware updates to devices that run Skype for Business Phone Edition.
  Periodically, administrators upload a set of device update rules to Skype for Business Server; after those rules have been tested and approved, they are then automatically downloaded and applied to the appropriate devices as those devices connect to the system.
  By default devices check for new update rules each time they turn on and connect to Skype for Business Server.
  Devices also check for updates every 24 hours after that initial sign on.

  Administrators cannot create their own device update rules; update rules can be created only by downloading and importing rule sets from the Microsoft website.
  This means that, over time, you are likely to collect rules that are outdated or are of no use in your organization.
  (For example, if your organization no longer uses LG-Nortel phones, then you no longer need the firmware updates for those devices.) Although these unneeded rules do not create any problems, they can complicate administration: it can be confusing to run the `Get-CsDeviceUpdateRule` cmdlet to return a collection of all your device update rules, only to discover that many of those rules are not applicable in your organization.
  To help lessen this confusion, the `Remove-CsDeviceUpdateRule` cmdlet can be used to remove any device update rule (or set of rules) that has been imported for use.
