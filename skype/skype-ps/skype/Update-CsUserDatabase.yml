description: |-
  The Skype for Business Server user database holds detailed information about such things as contacts, groups, and access permissions.
  As such, the database is required to periodically synchronize its contents with the information stored in Active Directory.

  More often than not, the automatic synch between the user database and Active Directory will keep the information in the user database up to date.
  However, it is possible that a problem might occur that prevents this automatic synchronization from taking place.
  In a case such as that, you can use the `Update-CsUserDatabase` cmdlet to force the user database to refresh its contents by re-reading all of the user information stored in Active Directory.
  You might also need to run this cmdlet if a product update ever includes a change to the user replicator service.
