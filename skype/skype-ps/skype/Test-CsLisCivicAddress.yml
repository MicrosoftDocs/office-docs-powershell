  code: |-
    Get-CsLisCivicAddress | Test-CsLisCivicAddress -UpdateValidationStatus
  description: |-
    This example shows how to test all LIS civic addresses.
    The example begins with a call to the `Get-CsLisCivicAddress` cmdlet to retrieve all civic addresses defined in the location database.
    These addresses are piped to the `Test-CsLisCivicAddress` cmdlet, which uses the E9-1-1 Network Routing Provider web service to validate each address.

description: |-
  In an Enterprise Voice implementation with Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1), user locations are determined based on location maps that map a subnet, port, switch, or wireless access point to a location.
  (In the absence of a connection to a mapped location, the user may be asked to input their location manually.) The addresses of these locations must be validated against the Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) by the E9-1-1 Network Routing Provider.
  This cmdlet uses the web service of that provider to validate mapped addresses.
  You can set up a service provider by calling the `Set-CsLisServiceProvider` cmdlet.

  If you want to update the MSAGValid property of the civic address, be sure to include the UpdateValidationStatus parameter in your call to the `Test-CsLisCivicAddress` cmdlet.
  Use the `Get-CsLisCivicAddress` cmdlet to retrieve civic addresses.
