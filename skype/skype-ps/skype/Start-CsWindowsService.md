# Start-CsWindowsService

## SYNOPSIS
The `Start-CsWindowsService` cmdlet enables you to start a Skype for Business Server service.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

### Name
```
Start-CsWindowsService [[-Name] <String>] [-ComputerName <String>] [-NoWait] [-Force] [-Report <String>]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### InputObject
```
Start-CsWindowsService [-InputObject <NTService>] [-NoWait] [-Force] [-Report <String>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Many Skype for Business Server components run as standard Windows services; for example, the Conferencing Attendant application is actually a service named RTCCAA.
If one of your Skype for Business Server services is currently stopped, you can restart that service by using the `Start-CsWindowsService` cmdlet.

Note, however, that the `Start-CsWindowsService` cmdlet can only start Skype for Business Server services; an error will occur if you attempt to start a non-Skype for Business Server service (such as the print spooler) using this cmdlet.

Functionally, the `Start-CsWindowsService` cmdlet is very similar to the generic Windows PowerShell Start-Service cmdlet; if you wanted to, you could use the `Start-Service` cmdlet to start a Skype for Business Server service.
On the other hand, the `Start-CsWindowsService` cmdlet includes a ComputerName parameter that makes it easy to start a service on a remote computer: you simply include the ComputerName parameter followed by the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the remote computer.
The `Start-Service` cmdlet does not have a comparable parameter.
In addition, the cmdlet's Report parameter enables you to keep a log of any errors that might occur when calling `Start-CsWindowsService`.

Like other Windows services, some Skype for Business Server services have a dependency on another service; for example, the Skype for Business Server Conferencing Attendant service cannot run unless the Application service is already running.
If you try to start a service that depends on another service, the `Start-CsWindowsService` cmdlet will start both of those services.
That means that, if you try to start the Conferencing Attendant service, the cmdlet will first start the Application service and then start the Conferencing Attendant service.
However, the `Start-CsWindowsService` cmdlet will not automatically start any dependent services of a service: if you start the Application service, the command will not automatically start the Conferencing Attendant service as well.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Start-CsWindowsService
```

The command shown in Example 1 starts all the Skype for Business Server services on the local computer.
This is done by calling the `Start-CsWindowsService` cmdlet without any parameters.
Note that you will not receive an error if you try to start a service that has already been started.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Start-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS"
```

Example 2 starts the Response Group application service on the local computer.
To do this, the command uses the Name parameter followed by the service name: RTCRGS.


### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------
```
Start-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCRGS" -ComputerName atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
```

The command shown in Example 3 also starts the Response Group application service; in this case, however, the service is started on the remote computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To start a service on a remote computer, include the ComputerName parameter followed by the FQDN of the remote computer.


### -------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------
```
Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.Status -ne "Running"} | Start-CsWindowsService
```

In Example 4, the command searches the local computer for all the Skype for Business Server services that are not currently running, then starts each of these inactive services.
To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsWindowsService` cmdlet to return a collection of all the Skype for Business Server services.
This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which selects only those services where the Status property is not equal to Running.
This filtered collection is then piped to the `Start-CsWindowsService` cmdlet, which starts each service in the collection.


## PARAMETERS

### -Name
Name of the Skype for Business Server service you want to start.
Note that you must use the service name (for example, RTCCAA) and not the service display name.
You can only pass a single service name to the Name parameter, and you cannot use wildcards in the service name.
Service names can be retrieved using the `Get-CsWindowsService` cmdlet.

Keep in mind that the `Start-CsWindowsService` cmdlet can only start Skype for Business Server services; you cannot use this cmdlet to start other Windows services.
For those services, you might be able to use the Windows PowerShell `Start-Service` cmdlet.


```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: Name
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ComputerName
Name of the remote computer hosting the service to be started; if this parameter is not included, then the `Start-CsWindowsService` cmdlet will start the specified service (or services) on the local computer.
The remote computer should be referenced using its FQDN; for example, atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.


```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: Name
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InputObject
Enables you to start a service using an object reference rather than a service name.
For example, if you use the `Get-CsWindowsService` cmdlet to return information about a service, and if you store the returned object in a variable named $x, you can then start the service using this command:

`$x = Get-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCCPS"`

`Start-CsWindowsService -InputObject $x.Name`


```yaml

Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NoWait
When present, causes the command to run and then immediately return control to the Windows PowerShell prompt.
If not present, control will not be returned until the command has completed and a status report has been written to the screen.
