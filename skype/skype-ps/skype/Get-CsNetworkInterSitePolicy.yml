examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkInterSitePolicy
  description: |-
    Calling the Get-CsNetworkInterSitePolicy cmdlet with no parameters retrieves all network site policies defined between two directly linked network sites.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 -------------------------- (Lync Server 2010)'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkInterSitePolicy -Identity Reno_Portland
  description: |-
    This example retrieves the network site policy with the Identity Reno_Portland.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkInterSitePolicy -Filter *Reno*
  description: |-
    Example 3 retrieves all network site policies that have the string Reno anywhere within the Identity value.
    The wildcard characters (*) within the value passed to the Filter parameter signify "any character or set of characters." In other words, the string *Reno* will match Identity values that begin with any character or characters, followed by the string Reno, followed by any character or characters.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkInterSitePolicy | Where-Object {$_.BWPolicyProfileID -eq $null}
  description: |-
    This example retrieves all network site policies that do not have a bandwidth policy profile assigned.
    The command begins by calling the Get-CsNetworkInterSitePolicy cmdlet, which, as we saw in Example 1, retrieves a collection of all network site policies.
    This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
    The Where-Object cmdlet narrows the collection down to only those site policies that don't have a bandwidth policy profile assigned.
    It does this by comparing to see if the BWPolicyProfileID property of each site policy is equal to (-eq) Null ($null).

  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The unique identifier of the network site policy you want to retrieve.
    Network site policies are created only at the global scope, so this identifier does not need to specify a scope.
