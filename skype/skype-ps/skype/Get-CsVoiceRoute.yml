    This command displays voice route settings where the Identity contains the string "test" anywhere within the value.
    To find the string test only at the end of the Identity, use the value \*test.
    Similarly, to find the string test only if it occurs at the beginning of the Identity, specify the value test\*.

  code: |-
    Get-CsVoiceRoute | Where-Object {$_.PstnGatewayList.Count -eq 0}
  description: |-
    This command retrieves all voice routes that have not had any PSTN gateways assigned.
    First all voice routes are retrieved using the Get-CsVoiceRoute cmdlet.
    These voice routes are then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet.
    The Where-Object cmdlet narrows down the results of the Get operation.
    In this case we look at each voice route (that's what the $_ represents) and check the Count property of the PstnGatewayList property.
    If the count of PSTN gateways is 0, the list is empty and no gateways have been defined for the route.

uid: SkypeForBusiness.Get-CsVoiceRoute
name: Get-CsVoiceRoute
description: |-
  Use this cmdlet to retrieve one or more existing voice routes.
  Voices routes contain instructions that tell Skype for Business Server how to route calls from Enterprise Voice users to phone numbers on the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or a private branch exchange (PBX).

  This cmdlet can be used to retrieve voice route information such as which PSTN gateways the route is associated with (if any), which PSTN usages are associated with the route, the pattern (in the form of a regular expression) that identifies the phone numbers to which the route applies, and caller ID settings.
  The PSTN usage associates the voice route to a voice policy.
