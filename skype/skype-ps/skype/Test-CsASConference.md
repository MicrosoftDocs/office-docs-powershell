# Test-CsASConference

## SYNOPSIS
Tests the ability of a pair of users to take part in an application sharing conference.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.


## SYNTAX

### ClientPlatform
```
Test-CsASConference [[-TargetFqdn] <String>] -ReceiverCredential <PSCredential>
 -SenderCredential <PSCredential> [-Authentication <AuthenticationMechanism>] [-Force]
 [-OutLoggerVariable <String>] [-OutVerboseVariable <String>] -ReceiverSipAddress <String>
 [-RegistrarPort <Int32>] -SenderSipAddress <String> [-TestJoinLauncher] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ServerPlatform
```
Test-CsASConference [-TargetFqdn] <String> [-Authentication <AuthenticationMechanism>] [-Force]
 [-OutLoggerVariable <String>] [-OutVerboseVariable <String>] [-ReceiverSipAddress <String>]
 [-RegistrarPort <Int32>] [-SenderSipAddress <String>] [-TestJoinLauncher] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Test-CsASConference` cmdlet verifies that a pair of test users can participate in an online conference that includes application sharing.
To do this, the cmdlet registers the two users with Skype for Business Server and then it uses one of the user accounts to create a new conference that includes applications sharing.
The cmdlet then verifies that the second user is able to join that conference.

Note that this command will fail if the test users have been assigned a conferencing policy that prevents them from using application sharing.

Skype for Business Server: The functions carried out by the `Test-CsASConference` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Test-CsASConference -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

The command shown in Example 1 verifies that an Application Sharing conference can be conducted on the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
This command assumes that you have configured a pair of test users for the specified pool.
If no such test users exist, the command will fail.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Test-CsASConference -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -TestJoinLauncher
```

Example 2 tests the ability of the Join Launcher service to participate in an Application Sharing conference on the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
Note that this command tests only the service itself; you do not need any mobile devices in order to run the command.


### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
$cred1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"

$cred2 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

Test-CsASConference -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -SenderSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $cred1 -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -ReceiverCredential $cred2
```

The commands shown in Example 2 test the ability of a pair of users (litwareinc\pilar and litwareinc\kenmyer) to log on to Skype for Business Server and then conduct an Application Sharing conference.
To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell command-line interface credential object containing the name and password of the user Pilar Ackerman.
(Because the logon name, litwareinc\pilar, has been included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box only requires the administrator to enter the password for the Pilar Ackerman account.) The resulting credential object is then stored in a variable named $cred1.
The second command does the same thing, this time returning a credential object for the Ken Myer account.

With the credential objects in hand, the third command determines whether or not these two users can log on to Skype for Business Server and conduct an Application Sharing conference.
To carry out this task, the `Test-CsASConference` cmdlet is called, along with the following parameters: TargetFqdn (the FQDN of the Registrar pool); SenderSipAddress (the SIP address for the first test user); SenderCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for this same user); ReceiverSipAddress (the SIP address for the other test user) and ReceiverCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for the other test user).


## PARAMETERS

### -ReceiverCredential
User credential object for the first of the two user accounts to be tested.
The value passed to ReceiverCredential should be an object reference obtained by using the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.
For example, this code returns a credentials object for the user litwareinc\pilar and stores that object in a variable named $y:

`$y = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"`

You need to supply the user password when running this command.

The receiver credential is not required if you are running the test under the health monitoring configuration settings for the pool.

### -SenderCredential
User credential object for the second of the two user accounts to be tested.
The value passed to SenderCredential should be an object reference obtained by using the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.

`$x = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"`

You need to supply the user password when running this command.

The sender credential is not required if you are running the test under the health monitoring configuration settings for the pool.
