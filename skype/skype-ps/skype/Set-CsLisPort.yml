### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a Location Information Server (LIS) port, creates an association between a port and a location (creating a new location if that location doesn't exist), or modifies an existing port and its associated location.
  The association between a port and location is used in an Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) Enterprise Voice implementation to notify an emergency services operator of the caller's location.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

  code: |-
    Set-CsLisPort -ChassisID 99-99-99-99-99-99 -PortID 4200 -PortIDSubType 1
  description: |-
    Example 1 creates or updates a LIS port location entry.
    The command in this example includes three parameters: ChassisID, PortID and PortIDSubtype.
    The value of the ChassisID is the MAC address 99-99-99-99-99-99, the value of the PortID is 4200 and the value of the PortIDSubType is 1.
    (Note that a value of 1 for PortIDSubType translates into a value of InterfaceAlias.
    This parameter and value could also have been entered like this: `-PortIDSubType InterfaceAlias`.) These three parameters are required to create a unique instance of a port location.

    Note that this example does not include any address information.
    It's possible to create a port entry on the Location Information Server without associating it with an address.
    However, emergency calls routed through this port may not (depending on subnet or switch locations that have been defined) contain enough information for the emergency operator to identify a location.

    IMPORTANT: If a LIS port location with this key combination already exists, it will be replaced by the values in this command.
    That means that if this port were associated with an address (a physical location), that association would no longer exist because we didn't include any location information in this command.
    The location will still exist in the location database, but it will not be associated with this port.

  code: |-
    $a = Get-CsLisPort | Where-Object {$_.ChassisID -eq "99-99-99-99-99-88"}

  description: |-
    This example updates all locations defined for ports with a MAC address (ChassisID) of 99-99-99-99-99-88.
    The first line in this example begins with a call to the `Get-CsLisPort` cmdlet, which retrieves all the ports that have been defined in the LIS service.
    That collection of ports is piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which finds all the items in the collection with a ChassisID equal to (-eq) 99-99-99-99-99-88.
    This collection of ports with the ChassisID 99-99-99-99-99-88 is assigned to the variable $a.

    In the second line of this example, we pipe the contents of variable $a (the collection of LIS ports with the ChassisID 99-99-99-99-99-88) to the `Set-CsLisPort` cmdlet.
    This cmdlet will take each item in that collection and update it with the values in the parameters specified (Location, HouseNumber, StreetName, StreetSuffix, City, State, Country, and PostalCode).

name: Set-CsLisPort
description: |-
  Enhanced 9-1-1 allows an emergency operator to identify the location of a caller without having to ask the caller for that information.
  In the case where a caller is calling from a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connection, that information must be extracted based on various connection factors.
  The VoIP administrator must configure a location map (called a wiremap) that will determine a caller's location.
  This cmdlet allows the administrator to map physical locations to the port through which the client is connected.

  The combination of ChassisID, PortID and PortIDSubType makes a unique port location.
  If you enter a ChassisID/PortID/PortIDSubType key combination that already exists, this cmdlet will update the location for that port based on the location parameters that are supplied.
  If the key combination does not exist, a new port location will be created.

  If a location with an address exactly matching the address parameters entered here (including null values) does not exist in the location database, a new address will be created based on the parameters entered with this cmdlet.
  (You can retrieve a list of locations by calling the `Get-CsLisLocation` cmdlet.) The `Set-CsLisPort` cmdlet does not require or prompt for location parameters; you can create a port entry without associating it with a location.
  It's also possible to create an invalid location with this cmdlet.
  A valid location consists of, at minimum, the Location, HouseNumber, StreetName, City, State and Country.
  If you do not supply all of these parameters, calls that are received by the referenced port may not contain the information required by the emergency operator (depending on whether valid settings are available for a switch, subnet, or wireless access point that can be used in place of port settings).
  It is recommended that you be as specific as possible with the location parameters and fill in as many as possible.

  One of the required parameters of this cmdlet is ChassisID.
  ChassisID is the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the port's network switch.
  If this switch does not exist in the location database, this cmdlet will create that switch.
  You can retrieve existing switches by calling the `Get-CsLisSwitch` cmdlet.
  Keep in mind that although a new switch entry will be created, that switch will not be automatically associated with the location information entered using the `Set-CsLisPort` cmdlet; you must set the switch location with the `Set-CsLisSwitch` cmdlet.
