  Address Book servers are intermediaries between Active Directory and Skype for Business Server.
  The Address Book server ensures that the user information stored in Skype for Business Server is in synch with the user information stored in Active Directory.
  This is done by periodically synching Address Book files with the information stored in the User database.
  By default, this synchronization takes place every five minutes.
  (However, that time interval can be modified by using the `Set-CsAddressBookConfiguration` cmdlet.)

  If you can't wait for synchronization to take place or if it appears that, for some reason, synchronization isn't taking place, you can use the `Update-CsAddressBook` cmdlet to force an Address Book server to immediately synch with the user information stored in the User database.
