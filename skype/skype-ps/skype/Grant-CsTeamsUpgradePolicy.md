# Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy

## SYNOPSIS
TeamsUpgradePolicy allows administrators to manage the transition from Skype for Business to Teams.


## SYNTAX
```
Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy [-Identity] <UserIdParameter>] [-PolicyName] <string> [-Tenant <guid>] [-Global] [-MigrateMeetingsToTeams] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
TeamsUpgradePolicy allows administrators to manage the transition from Skype for Business to Teams. As an organization with Skype for Business starts to adopt Teams, administrators can manage the user experience in their organization using the concept of coexistence "mode".  Mode defines in which client incoming chats and calls land as well as in what service (Teams or Skype for Business) new meetings are scheduled in. Mode also governs what functionality is avaiable in the Teams client.  Finally, prior to upgrading to TeamsOnly mode administrators can use TeamsUpgradePolicy to trigger notifications in the Skype for Business client to inform users of the pending upgrade. 

This cmdlet enables admins to apply TeamsUpgradePolicy to either individual users or to set the default for the entire organization. 

Office 365 provides all relevant instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy via built-in, read-only policies. The built-in instances are listed below.

|Identity|Mode|NotifySfbUsers|Comments|
|---|---|---|---|
|Islands|Islands|False|Default configuration. Allows a single user to evaluate both clients side by side. Chats and calls can land in either client, so users must always run both clients.|
|IslandsWithNotify|Islands|True|Same as Islands and it adds a banner in the Skype for Business client informing the user that Teams will soon replace Skype for Business.|
|SfBOnly|SfBOnly|False|Calling, chat functionality and meeting scheduling in the Teams app are disabled.|
|SfBOnlyWithNotify|SfBOnly|True|Same as SfBOnly and it adds a banner in the Skype for Business client informing the user that Teams will soon replace Skype for Business.|
|SfBWithTeamsCollab|SfBWithTeamsCollab|False|Calling, chat functionality and meeting scheduling in the Teams app are disabled.|
|SfBWithTeamsCollabWithNotify|SfBWithTeamsCollab|True|Same as SfBWithTeamsCollab and it adds a banner in the Skype for Business client informing the user that Teams will soon replace Skype for Business.|
|SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings|SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings|False|Calling and chat functionality in the Teams app are disabled.|
|SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetingsWithNotify|SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings|True|Same as SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings and it adds a banner in the Skype for Business client informing the user that Teams will soon replace Skype for Business.|
|UpgradeToTeams|TeamsOnly|False|Use this mode to upgrade users to Teams and to prevent chat, calling, and meeting scheduling in Skype for Business.|
|Global|Islands|False||

**NOTES:** 
- TeamsUpgradePolicy is available in both Office 365 and in on-premises versions of Skype for Business Server, but there are differences: 
    - In Office 365, admins can specify both coexistence mode and whether to trigger notifications of pending upgrade.  
    - In on-premises with Skype for Business Server, the only available option is to trigger notifications. Skype for Business Server 2015 with CU8 or Skype for Business Server 2019 are required.
- TeamsUpgradePolicy in Office 365 can be granted to users homed on-premises in hybrid deployments of Skype for Business as follows:
    - Coexistence mode is honored by users homed on-premises, however on-premises users cannot be granted the UpgradeToTeams instance (mode=TeamsOnly) of TeamsUpgradePolicy.  To be upgraded to TeamsOnly mode, users must be either homed in Skype for Business Online or have no Skype account anywhere.    
    - The NotifySfBUsers setting of Office 365 TeamsUpgradePolicy is not honored by users homed on-premises. Instead, the on-premises version of TeamsUpgradePolicy must be used. 
- In Office 365, all relevant instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy are built into the system, so there is no corresponding New cmdlet available. In contrast, Skype for Business Server does not contain built-in instances, so the New cmdlet is available on-premises.  Only NotifySfBUsers property is available in on-premises.
- When granting a user a policy with mode=TeamsOnly or mode=SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings, by default, meetings organized by that user will be migrated to Teams. For details, see [Using the Meeting Migration Service (MMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/audio-conferencing-in-office-365/setting-up-the-meeting-migration-service-mms).

**IMPORTANT**
When users are in any of the Skype for Business modes (SfBOnly, SfBWithTeamsCollab, SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings), calling and chat functionality in the Teams app are disabled (but chat in the context of a Teams meeting is still allowed). Similarly, when users are in the SfBOnly or SfBWithTeamsCollab modes, meeting scheduling is disabled. For more details, see [Migration and interoperability guidance for organizations using Teams together with Skype for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/migration-interop-guidance-for-teams-with-skype).

The `Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy` cmdlet checks the configuration of the corresponding settings in TeamsMessagingPolicy, TeamsCallingPolicy, and TeamsMeetingPolicy to determine if those settings would be superceded by TeamsUpgradePolicy and if so, an informational message is provided in PowerShell.  It is not necessary to set these other policy settings. This is for informational purposes only. Below is an example of what the PowerShell warning looks like:

`Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -Identity user1@contoso.com -PolicyName SfBWithTeamsCollab`

`WARNING: The user 'user1@contoso.com' currently has enabled values for: AllowUserChat, AllowPrivateCalling, AllowPrivateMeetingScheduling, AllowChannelMeetingScheduling, however these values will be ignored. This is because you are granting this user TeamsUpgradePolicy with mode=SfBWithTeamsCollab, which causes the Teams client to behave as if they are disabled.`

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Grant Policy to an individual user
```
PS C:\> Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -PolicyName UpgradeToTeams -Identity mike@contoso.com
```

The above cmdlet assigns the "UpgradeToTeams" policy to user Mike@contoso.com.  This effectively upgrades the user to Teams only mode. This command will only succeed if the user does not have an on-premises Skype for Business account. 

### Example 2: Remove Policy for an individual user
```
PS C:\> Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -PolicyName $null -Identity mike@contoso.com
```

The above cmdlet removes any policy changes made to user Mike@contoso.com and effectively Inherits the global tenant setting for teams Upgrade. 

### Example 3: Grant Policy to the entire tenant 
```
PS C:\> Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -PolicyName SfBOnly -Global
```

To grant a policy to all users in the org (except any that have an explicit policy assigned), omit the identity parameter. If you do not specify the -Global paramter, you will be prompted to confirm the operation.

### Example 4 Get a report on existing TeamsUpgradePolicy users (Screen Report)
You can get the output on the screen, on CSV or Html format. For Screen Report
```
Get-CSOnlineUser | select UserPrincipalName, teamsupgrade*
```

### Example 5 Get a report on existing TeamsUpgradePolicy users (CSV Report)
```
$objUsers = Get-CSOnlineUser | select UserPrincipalName, teamsupgrade*
$objusers | ConvertTo-Csv -NoTypeInformation | Out-File "$env:USERPROFILE\desktop\TeamsUpgrade.csv"
```
This will create a CSV  file on the Desktop of the current user with the name "TeamsUpgrade.csv"

### Example 6 Get a report on existing TeamsUpgradePolicy users (HTML Report)
```
$objUsers = Get-CSOnlineUser | select UserPrincipalName, teamsupgrade*
$objusers | ConvertTo-Html | Out-File "$env:USERPROFILE\desktop\TeamsUpgrade.html"

```
After running these lines will create an  HTML  file on the Desktop of the current user with the name "TeamUpgrade.html"

### Example 7 Get a report on existing TeamsUpgradePolicy users (CSV Report - Oneliner version)
```
Get-CSOnlineUser | select UserPrincipalName, teamsupgrade* | ConvertTo-Csv -NoTypeInformation | Out-File "$env:USERPROFILE\desktop\TeamsUpgrade.csv"
```
This will create a CSV  file on the Desktop of the current user with the name "TeamsUpgrade.csv"

### Example 8 Get a report on existing TeamsUpgradePolicy users (HTML Report - Oneliner Version)
```
Get-CSOnlineUser | select UserPrincipalName, teamsupgrade* | ConvertTo-Html | Out-File "$env:USERPROFILE\desktop\TeamsUpgrade.html"
```
After running these lines will create an  HTML  file on the Desktop of the current user with the name "TeamUpgrade.html"
