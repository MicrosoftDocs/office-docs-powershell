# Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy

## SYNOPSIS
TeamsUpgradePolicy allows administrators to manage the transition from Skype for Business to Teams. IMPORTANT:  TeamsUpgradePolicy will replace TeamsInteropPolicy.  Aspects of TeamsUpgradePolicy are still in preview mode as described below.

Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy \[\[-Identity\] \<UserIdParameter\>\] \[-PolicyName\] \<string\> \[-Tenant \<guid\>\] \[-DomainController \<Fqdn\>\] \[-PassThru\] \[-WhatIf\] \[-Confirm\] \[\<CommonParameters\>\]

## SYNTAX

```
Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy  [[-PolicyName] <Object>] [[-Identity] <Object>]
 [-Tenant <Object>][-PassThru] [-Confirm] [-DomainController <Object>] [-WhatIf] [-AsJob]
```

## DESCRIPTION
TeamsUpgradePolicy allows administrators to manage the transition from Skype for Business to Teams. This cmdlet returns the set of instances of this policy. As an organization with Skype for Business starts to adopt Teams, administrators can manage client behavior for their end user using the concept of "mode", which defines where routing behavior (e.g in which client do chats and calls land). In the future, mode will also be used to define client behavior in Teams client in terms of what functionality will be available.  TeamsUpradePolicy can be granted either on a per user basis or on a tenant-wide basis.  In addition, prior to upgrading to TeamsOnly mode administrators can use TeamsUpgradePolicy to trigger notifications in the Skype for Business client to inform users of the pending upgrade. 

IMPORTANT:  TeamsUpgradePolicy will replace TeamsInteropPolicy. Components that previously honored TeamsInteropPolicy are being updated to honor TeamsUpgradePolicy instead. During the transition, use of these 2 policies must be coordinated during the transition. After transition is complete, TeamsInteorpPolicy will be removed.


NOTES: 
   All relevant instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy are built into the system, so there is no corresponding New cmdlet.

   Instances with mode set to SfBWithTeamsCollab are not yet functional. From a routing perspective, this will behave like SfBOnly mode.
   When granting TeamsUpgradePolicy, you must also grant the corresponding instances of TeamsInteropPolicy as described later below.


## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Grant Policy to an individual user
```
PS C:\> Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -PolicyName UpgradeToTeams -Identity mike@contoso.com
```

The above cmdlet assigns the "UpgradeToTeams" policy to user Mike@contoso.com.  This effectively upgrades the user to Teams only mode.

### Example 2: Grant Policy to the entire tenant 
```
PS C:\> Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -PolicyName SfBOnly 
```

To grant a policy to all users in the org (except any that have an explicit policy assinged), omit the idenity parameter.

| If you grant an instance of TeamsUpgradePolicy with this value of Mode…| …Then grant this instance of TeamsInteropPolicy |
| :------------- |:-------------|
| Islands | DisallowOverrideCallingDefaultChatDefault |
| SfBonly, SfBWithTeamsCollab | DisallowOverrideCallingSfbChatSfb |
| TeamsOnly | DisallowOverrideCallingTeamsChatTeams |
