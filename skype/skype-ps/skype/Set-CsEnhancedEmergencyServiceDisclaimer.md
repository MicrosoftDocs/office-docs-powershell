# Set-CsEnhancedEmergencyServiceDisclaimer

## SYNOPSIS
Sets disclaimer text that will be used globally to prompt for location information for an Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) implementation.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.
It has been deprecated for use with Skype for Business Server.
For Skype for Business Server, E9-1-1 disclaimers should be configured by using the `New-CsLocationPolicy` cmdlet and the `Set-CsLocationPolicy` cmdlet.


## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Set-CsEnhancedEmergencyServiceDisclaimer [[-Identity] <XdsIdentity>] [-Body <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Instance
```
Set-CsEnhancedEmergencyServiceDisclaimer [-Instance <PSObject>] [-Body <String>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
In order for an Enterprise Voice implementation to provide E9-1-1 service, locations must be mapped to ports, subnets, switches and wireless access points to identify the caller's location.
When the caller is connecting from outside one of these mapped points, he must enter his location manually for it to be received by emergency services.
This cmdlet sets a text string that will be displayed to users who decide not to enter their location information.
This message will be displayed only if the LocationRequired property of the user's location policy is set to Disclaimer.
(You can retrieve location policy settings by calling the `Get-CsLocationPolicy` cmdlet.)


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsEnhancedEmergencyServiceDisclaimer -Body "Warning: If you do not provide a location, emergency services may be delayed in reaching your location should you need to call for help."
```

This example replaces the text of the global enhanced emergency services disclaimer with the text provided in the string passed to the Body parameter.
This setting can be applied only at the global scope, which is the default for Identity and therefore does not need to be specified.
