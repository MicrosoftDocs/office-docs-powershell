examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    Grant-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity Ken.Myer@contoso.com -PolicyName "RedmondOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 assigns the per-user online voice routing policy RedmondOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy to the user ken.myer@contoso.com.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Grant-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity Ken.Myer@contoso.com -PolicyName $Null
  description: |-
    In Example 2, any per-user online voice routing policy previously assigned to the user Ken Myer is unassigned from that user; as a result, Ken Myer will be managed by the global online voice routing policy. To unassign a per-user policy, set the PolicyName to a null value ($null).

- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    Get-CsOnlineUser | Grant-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy -PolicyName "RedmondOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy"
  description: |-
    Example 3 assigns the per-user online voice routing policy RedmondOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy to all the users in the tenant. To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsOnlineUser` cmdlet to get all user accounts enabled for Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business Online. Those user accounts are then piped to the `Grant-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy` cmdlet, which assigns each user the online voice routing policy RedmondOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 4
  code: |-
    Grant-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy -PolicyName "RedmondOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy" -Global
  description: |-
    Example 4 assigns the per-user online voice routing policy RedmondOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy as the global online voice routing policy. This affects all the users in the tenant, except any that have an explicit policy assignment.

- title: Example 5
  code: |-

description: |-
  Online voice routing policies are used in Microsoft Phone System Direct Routing scenarios. Assigning your Teams users an online voice routing policy enables those users to receive and to place phone calls to the public switched telephone network by using your on-premises SIP trunks.

  Note that simply assigning a user an online voice routing policy will not enable them to make PSTN calls via Teams. Among other things, you will also need to enable those users for Phone System and will need to assign them an appropriate online voice policy.
