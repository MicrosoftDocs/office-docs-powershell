  code: |-
    Remove-CsLisLocation -Location Bldg30NEWing -HouseNumber 1000 -StreetName Main -City Redmond -State WA -Country US
  description: |-
    Example 1 removes a location named Bldg30NEWing.
    This command specifies values for the parameters Location, HouseNumber, StreetName, City, State and Country.
    This means that those are the only properties of the location to be deleted that contain non-null values.
    If you don't supply parameter values for all non-null properties, the location will not be deleted.
    You will be prompted for any parameter that you haven't specified in the command, but if they contain null values you can simply press Enter at each prompt.

  code: |-
    Get-CsLisLocation -Unreferenced | Remove-CsLisLocation
  description: |-
    This example will remove all locations that are not referenced by a LIS port, subnet, switch, or wireless access point.
    The command begins with a call to the `Get-CsLisLocation` cmdlet, specifying the Unreferenced parameter.
    This will return a collection of all locations that are not referenced by a LIS port, subnet, switch, or wireless access point.
    This collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsLisLocation` cmdlet, which removes each location in the collection.

uid: SkypeForBusiness.Remove-CsLisLocation
name: Remove-CsLisLocation
description: |-
  E9-1-1 enables those who answer emergency calls to determine the caller's geographic location without having to ask the caller for that information.
  In Skype for Business Server the location is determined based on mapping the caller's port, subnet, switch, or wireless access point to a specific location.
  This cmdlet removes a location from the location configuration database.
  All properties of a location combined make the location unique, so you must enter all non-null properties of the location to remove it.
  If you do not enter all non-null properties of the location you want to remove (and no other location contains only the properties you specified), no locations will be removed.
  You won't receive an error in this case, but no action will occur.

  This cmdlet will not remove locations that are associated with a Location Information Server (LIS) port, subnet, switch, or wireless access point.
  If you attempt to remove a location referenced by any of these devices, you'll receive an error.
  You must remove all references before removing the location.
  You can use the `Remove-CsLisPort` cmdlet, the `Remove-CsLisSubnet` cmdlet, the `Remove-CsLisSwitch` cmdlet and the `Remove-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint` cmdlet to remove these references.
