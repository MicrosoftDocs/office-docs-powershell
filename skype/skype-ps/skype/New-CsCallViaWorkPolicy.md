# New-CsCallViaWorkPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Use the New-CsCallViaWorkPolicy cmdlet to create a new call via work policy that enables and manages the characteristics of outbound calls placed through the Skype for Business client.

## SYNTAX

```
New-CsCallViaWorkPolicy [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-AdminCallbackNumber <String>] [-Confirm]
 [-Enabled <Boolean>] [-Force] [-InMemory] [-Tenant <Guid>] [-UseAdminCallbackNumber <Boolean>] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
To return a list of all the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles a cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt.

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -Match "\<DesiredCmdletName\>"}

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 -------------------------- 
```

New-CsCallViaWorkPolicy -Identity Site:Redmond -Enabled $true -AdminCallbackNumber +14258881234 -UseAdminCallbackNumber $true
```

This example creates a call via work policy for the Redmond site.
The policy is enabled, the administrative callback number is specified and enforced.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identity to be assigned to the policy.
New policies can be created at the site or per-user scope.
To create a new site policy, use the prefix "site:" and the name of the site as the Identity.
For example, to create a new policy for the Redmond site you would use this syntax: `-Identity site:Redmond.`
To create a new per-user policy, this syntax: `-Identity SalesDepartmentPolicy.`

You cannot create a new global policy.
If you want to make changes to the global policy, use the Set-CsCallViawork cmdlet instead.
Likewise, you cannot create a new site or per-user policy if a policy with that Identity already exists.
If you need to make changes to an existing policy, use the Set-CsCallViawork cmdlet.
