  The Get-CsPoolBackupRelationship cmdlet returns the fully qualified domain name of the backup pool associated with a Registrar pool.
  Note that this is read-only information: there is no corresponding Set-CsPoolBackupRelationship cmdlet that lets you use the Windows PowerShell command-line interface to create a backup association.
  Instead, backup pools must be assigned using Skype for Business Server Topology Builder.

  The functions carried out by the Get-CsPoolBackupRelationship cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
