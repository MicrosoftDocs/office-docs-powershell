  code: |-
    Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -TargetSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    Example 1 tests the Address Book Web Query service for the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com` by searching for the contact with the SIP Address sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com.
    This command will work only if test users have been defined for the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
    If it has, then the command will run under the credentials of the first test user in the defined for the pool.

    If test users have not been defined, then the command will fail.
    If you have not defined test users for a pool then you must include the UserSipAddress parameter and the credentials of the user under which the command should be run.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    $cred1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"

    Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -UserCredential $cred1 -UserSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -TargetSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 also test the availability of the Address Book Web Query service; in this case, however, the commands are running under the credentials of the user Ken Myer (litwareinc\kenmyer).
    To do this, the first command uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell credential object containing the name and password of the user Ken Myer.
    (Because the logon name, litwareinc\kenmyer, has been included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box will only require the administrator to enter the password for the Ken Myer account.) The resulting credential object is then stored in a variable named $cred1.

    In the second command, the `Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery` cmdlet is used to test the Address Book Web Query service for the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
    To run this command under Ken Myer's user credentials, the UserCredential parameter is included, along with the parameter value $cred1.
    The command also uses the TargetSipAddress to specify that the cmdlet should search the Address Book for the contact with the SIP Address sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery -TargetUri https://atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/groupexpansion -UserSipAddress "sip:packerman@litwareinc.com" -TargetSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    Example 3 shows how you can test the Address Book Web Query service for `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
    To do this, the `Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery` cmdlet is called along with three parameters: TargetUri, which specifies the URI of the Address Book Web Query service; UserSipAddress, which contains the Windows PowerShell SIP address of the user account being used in the test and TargetSipAddress, which contains the SIP address of the user account being searched for.

  The `Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery` cmdlet is an example of a "synthetic transaction". Synthetic transactions are used in Skype for Business Server to verify that users are able to successfully complete common tasks such as logging on to the system, exchanging instant messages or making calls to a phone located on the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
  These tests can be conducted manually by an administrator or they can be automatically run by an application such as Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (formerly Microsoft Operations Manager).

  Synthetic transactions are typically conducted in two different ways.
  Many administrators will use the CsHealthMonitoringConfiguration cmdlets to set up test users for each of their Registrar pools.
  These test users are a pair of users who have been preconfigured for use with synthetic transactions.
  (Typically these are test accounts and not accounts that belong to actual users.) With test users configured for a pool, administrators can run a synthetic transaction against that pool without having to specify the identities of (and supply the credentials for) the user accounts involved in the test.

  Alternatively, administrators can run a synthetic transaction by using actual user accounts.
  For example, if two users are unable to exchange instant messages, an administrator could run a synthetic transaction using those two user accounts (as opposed to a pair of test accounts), and then try to diagnose and resolve the problem.
  If you decide to conduct a synthetic transaction using actual user accounts, you will need to supply the logon names and passwords for each user.

  The `Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery` cmdlet provides a way for administrators to verify that users can use the Address Book Web Query service to search for a specific contact.
  When run, the `Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery` cmdlet will first connect to the Web Ticket service in order to be authenticated.
  If authentication is successful, the cmdlet will then connect to the Address Book Web Query service and search for the specified contact.
  If that contact is found, the cmdlet will attempt to return that information to the local computer.
  The test will be marked a success only if all of those steps can be completed.
