# Remove-CsVoiceNormalizationRule

## SYNOPSIS
Removes a voice normalization rule.
Voice normalization rules are used to convert telephone dialing requirements (for example, dialing 9 to access an outside line) to the E.164 phone number format used by Skype for Business Server.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsVoiceNormalizationRule [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [-BypassDualWrite <Object>] [-Tenant <Object>] [-AsJob] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet removes a named voice normalization rule.
These rules are a required part of phone authorization and call routing.
They define the requirements for converting (or translating) numbers from an internal Skype for Business Server format to a standard (E.164) format.
An understanding of regular expressions is helpful in order to define number patterns that will be translated.

Rules that are removed by using this cmdlet will be deleted from the dial plans of the organization, so they won't be returned by the `Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet and will not appear in the NormalizationRules property returned by a call to the `Get-CsDialPlan` cmdlet.
This means that calling the `Remove-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet could leave a dial plan with no normalization rules.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Remove-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity site:Redmond/SeattleRule1
```

This example removes the voice normalization rule with the Identity site:Redmond/SeattleRule1.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Remove-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity site:Redmond
```

This example removes all voice normalization rules from site Redmond.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The unique identity of the rule to be removed.
If the Identity specified includes the scope followed by a slash and then the name (for example: site:Redmond/Rule1, where site:Redmond is the scope and Rule1 is the name), the one rule with that unique Identity will be removed.
If the value passed to the Identity contains only the scope (site:Redmond), all normalization rules at that scope will be removed.
