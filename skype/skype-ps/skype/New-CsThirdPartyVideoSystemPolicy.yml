    The command shown in Example 1 creates a new third-party video system policy assigned to the Redmond site.
    With this policy, VTCs will not be allowed to send low resolution video; that's because the SupportsSendingLowResolution parameter has been set to False ($False).

  Third-party video systems are VTC devices that provide remote users with telepresence capabilities (most notably audio and video).
  In Skype for Business Server, third-party VTC devices can be configured as Active Directory contact objects, much in the same way that analog phones and common area phones can be configured as contact objects.
  Associating each VTC device with a contact object makes it easy for administrators to track and to manage, these devices.

  One key management task related to VTC devices is to enable (or disable) the ability of these devices to send low-resolution video.
  By default, VTC devices are allowed to send low-resolution video.
  However, administrators can create third-party video system policies that disable the use of low-resolution video.
  This might be useful for devices located in conference rooms or other areas where low-resolution video is not considered acceptable.
  The `New-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem` cmdlet provides a way for administrators to create these third-party video system policies.
