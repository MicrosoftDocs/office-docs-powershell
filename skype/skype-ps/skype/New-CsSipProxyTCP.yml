### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a new SipProxy.TCP object, which can then be used to configure a static route to use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as its transport protocol.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

  code: |-
    After the SipProxy.TCP object has been created, the New-CsSipProxyTransport cmdlet creates a TCP transport object.

    $tcp = New-CsSipProxyTCP -IPAddress 192.168.1.100

    $transport = New-CsSipProxyTransport -TransportChoice $tcp -Port 7500
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 1 create a new SIP proxy transport object that uses TCP as its transport.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the New-CsSipProxyTCP cmdlet to create a new SipProxy.TCP object that points to the next hop server with the IP address 192.168.1.100; this TCP object is stored in a variable named $tcp.

  When you send a SIP message to someone, that message might need to traverse multiple subnets and networks before it is delivered; the path traveled by the message is often referred to as a route.
  In networking, there are two types of routes: dynamic and static.
  With dynamic routing, servers use algorithms to determine the next location (the next hop) where a message should be forwarded.
  With static routing, message paths are predetermined by system administrators.
  When a message is received by a server, the server checks the message address and then forwards the message to the next hop server that has been preconfigured by an administrator.
  If configured correctly, static routes help ensure timely, and accurate, delivery of messages, and with minimal overhead placed on servers.
  The downside to static routes is the messages are not dynamically rerouted in the event of a network failure.

  Skype for Business Server enables you to set up static routes for proxy servers.
  These routes are composed of two primary pieces: proxy configuration settings (created using the New-CsProxyConfiguration cmdlet), and SIP proxy routes.
  In turn, SIP proxy routes have a number of properties; for example, each route must have a Transport, a property that defines the network protocol used for transmitting messages along the route.

  Skype for Business Server allows you to specify either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) as your transport protocol.
  If you decide to use TCP as your protocol, you must first create a TCP object by using the New-CsSipProxyTCP cmdlet.
  You can then use that object to specify the protocol for the Transport object created by the New-CsSipProxyTransport cmdlet.

  You do not need to use the New-CsSipProxyTCP cmdlet if you use the New-CsStaticRoute cmdlet to create your static route.
