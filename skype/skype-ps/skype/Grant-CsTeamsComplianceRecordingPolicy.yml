- type: <xref href="UserIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    Indicates the Identity of the user account to be assigned the per-user Teams recording policy.
    User Identities can be specified using one of the following formats:
    1) the user's SIP address;
    2) the user's user principal name (UPN);
    3) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).

  defaultValue: None

  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Enables you to pass a user object through the pipeline that represents the user account being assigned the Teams recording policy.
    By default, the Grant-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy cmdlet does not pass objects through the pipeline.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""

  name: PolicyName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Name of the policy to be assigned.
    The PolicyName is simply the policy Identity without the policy scope i.e. the "Tag:" prefix.
    For example, a policy with the Identity Tag:ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy has a PolicyName equal to ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy.

    To revoke a per-user policy previously assigned to a user, set the PolicyName to a null value ($null).

    For example:

    -Tenant "38aad667-af54-4397-aaa7-e94c79ec2308"

    You can return your tenant ID by running this command:

    Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID

    If you are using a remote session of Windows PowerShell and are connected only to Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business Online you do not have to include the Tenant parameter.
    Instead, the tenant ID will automatically be filled in for you based on your connection information.
    The Tenant parameter is primarily for use in a hybrid deployment.

description: |-
  Teams recording policies are used in automatic policy-based recording scenarios.
  When Microsoft Teams users participate in meetings or make or receive calls, the policy-based recording applications i.e. bots associated with the user's Teams recording policy are invited into the call or meeting to record audio, video and video-based screen sharing activity.

  Note that simply assigning a Teams recording policy to a Microsoft Teams user will not activate automatic policy-based recording for all Microsoft Teams calls and meetings that the user participates in.
  Among other things, you will need to create an application instance of a policy-based recording application i.e. a bot in your tenant and will then need to assign an appropriate policy to the user.

  Please work with your Microsoft certified policy-based recording application provider to obtain an instance of their recording application.
  Please refer to the documentation of the CsOnlineApplicationInstance cmdlets for information on how to create an application instance of a policy-based recording application.

  Assigning your Microsoft Teams users a Teams recording policy activates automatic policy-based recording for all new Microsoft Teams calls and meetings that the users participate in.
  The system will load the recording application and join it to appropriate calls and meetings in order for it to enforce compliance with the administrative set policy.
  Existing calls and meetings are unaffected.
