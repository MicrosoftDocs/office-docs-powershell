examples:
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsQoEConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EnableQoE $False
  description: |-
    The command in Example 1 uses the New-CsQoEConfiguration cmdlet to create a new set of Quality of Experience settings with the Identity site:Redmond.
    In addition to the Identity site:Redmond, the new settings also have the EnableQoE property set to False.
    Because site settings take precedence over global settings, this means that QoE will be disabled for the Redmond site, regardless of whether or not QoE has been enabled at the global scope.

- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsQoEConfiguration -Identity site:Dublin -KeepQoEDataForDays 30 -PurgeHourOfDay 4
  description: |-
    This command creates new QoE settings that apply to the Dublin site.
    In this example we've set the KeepQoEDataForDays parameter to 30, so QoE data will be purged from the database after 30 days rather than the default 60 days.
    In addition, we've set the PurgeHourOfDay parameter to 4, meaning any data older than the 30 days we just specified will be purged at 4:00 AM.

    Note: If you have enabled QoE and call detail recording (CDR), for performance reasons it's a good idea to make sure the PurgeHourOfDay setting is different for QoE than for CDR.

description: |-
  QoE metrics track the quality of audio and video calls made in your organization, including such things as the number of network packets lost, background noise, and the amount of "jitter" (differences in packet delay).
  These metrics are stored in a database apart from other data (such as call detail records), which allows you to enable and disable QoE independent of other data recording.
  Use this cmdlet to create settings that configure QoE at the site level.
  (Settings at the global level exist by default and cannot be removed.)

  QoE is part of the Monitoring Server role; therefore Monitoring Server must be deployed on your Skype for Business Server installation before QoE recording takes effect or any QoE data can be collected.
