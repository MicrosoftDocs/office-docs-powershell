    Test-CsExUMVoiceMail -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    The preceding example tests Exchange Unified Messaging voice mail connectivity for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    This command will work only if test users have been defined for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    If they have, then the command will determine whether or not the first test user is able to use Unified Messaging voice mail.
    If test users have not been configured for the pool then the command will fail.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $credential = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"

    Test-CsExUMVoiceMail -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -SenderSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $credential
  description: |-
    The commands shown in Example 2 test Exchange Unified Messaging voice mail connectivity for the user litwareinc\kenmyer.
    To do this, the first command in the example uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell command-line interface credentials object for the user litwareinc\kenmyer.
    Note that you must supply the password for this account in order to create a valid credentials object and to ensure that the `Test-CsExUMVoiceMail` cmdlet can carry out its check.

    The second command in the example uses the supplied credentials object ($x) and the SIP address of the user litwareinc\kenmyer in order to determine whether or this user can connect to Exchange Unified Messaging voice mail.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Test-CsExUMVoiceMail -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -OutLoggerVariable VoicemailTest

    $VoicemailTest.ToXML() | Out-File C:\Logs\VoicemailTest.xml
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 3 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the OutLoggerVariable parameter is included in order to generate a detailed log of every step undertaken by the `Test-CsExUMVoiceMail` cmdlet, as well as the success or failure of each of those steps.
    To do this, the OutLoggerVariable parameter is added along with the parameter value ExumText; that causes detailed logging information to be stored in a variable named $ExumTest.
    In the final command in the example, the ToXML() method is used to convert the log information to XML format.
    That XML data is then written to a file named C:\Logs\VoicemailTest.xml by using the `Out-File` cmdlet.

  name: OutLoggerVariable
  description: |+
    When present, detailed output from running the cmdlet will be stored in the specified variable.
    This variable includes a pair of methods - ToHTML and ToXML - that can then be used to save that output to either an HTML or an XML file.

    To store output in a logger variable named $TestOutput use the following syntax:

    `-OutLoggerVariable TestOutput`

    Note: Do not use prepend a $ character when specifying the variable name.

    To save the information stored in the logger variable to an HTML file, use a command similar to this:

    `$TestOutput.ToHTML() > C:\Logs\TestOutput.html`

    To save the information stored in the logger variable to an XML file, use a command similar to this:

    `$TestOutput.ToXML() > C:\Logs\TestOutput.xml`
