  The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
  Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
  Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

  Many organizations (including organizations involved in health care and organizations involved in the financial industry) are required to maintain archives of all their electronic communications; this includes conversations that might take place using the Persistent Chat service.
  Skype for Business Server allows you to create a separate compliance database that keeps a detailed of archive of everything that happens in your Persistent Chat chat rooms.
  Persistent Chat compliance can be enabled or disabled at the site scope or at the service scope (that is, compliance can be enabled or disabled for a given Persistent Chat pool).
  In addition, Persistent Chat compliance can only be managed using the Windows PowerShell command-line interface; there are no options available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel for managing Persistent Chat compliance.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the New-CsPersistentChatComplianceConfiguration cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
