- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsConferenceServer -Identity "ConferencingServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -ImSipPort 5075
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 modifies the instant messaging SIP port for the Conference Server ConferencingServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    In this example, the port is changed to 5075.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsService -ConferencingServer | ForEach-Object {Set-CsConferenceServer -Identity $_.Identity -ImSipPort 5075}
  description: |-
    Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1; in this case, however, the instant messaging SIP port is changed for all the Conference Servers in the organization.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsService` cmdlet and the ConferencingServer parameter to return a collection of all the Conferencing Servers currently in use.
    That collection is then piped to the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet, which runs the `Set-CsConferenceServer` cmdlet against each server in the collection, setting the ImSipPort to 5075.

  Conference Servers (also known as A/V Conferencing Servers) are used to provide audio and video capabilities to conferences.
  In turn, the `Set-CsConferenceServer` cmdlet can be used to modify the properties of these servers; in particular, you can specify which ports are used for such things as audio traffic, video traffic and application sharing.
  You can also use the `Set-CsConferenceServer` cmdlet to associate a given server with a Edge Server or Archiving Server.
