# Publish-CsLisConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Publishes the Location Information Server (LIS) configuration to the Central Management store.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Publish-CsLisConfiguration [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
In order to implement Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) in Skype for Business Server, you must create a location mapping (called a wiremap).
This mapping includes matching physical addresses to ports, subnets, switches and wireless access points so any calls made over an Enterprise Voice connection will reach the nearest emergency operator and provide that operator with the correct location of the caller.
This mapping configuration, created by calling cmdlets such as the `Set-CsLisPort` cmdlet and the `Set-CsLisSubnet` cmdlet, is stored in a central location database.
This cmdlet commits any changes in the central location database to the Central Management store, allowing the information to be replicated to the Location Information servers so that the locations can be rendered to clients.
The configuration can be removed from the Central Management store by calling the `Unpublish-CsLisConfiguration` cmdlet.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
