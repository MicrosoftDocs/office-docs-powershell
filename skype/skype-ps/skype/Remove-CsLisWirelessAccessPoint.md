# Remove-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint

## SYNOPSIS
Removes a Location Information Server (LIS) wireless access point (WAP).
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint -BSSID <String> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Enhanced 9-1-1 allows an emergency operator to identify the location of a caller without having to ask the caller for that information.
In the case where a caller is calling from a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connection, that information must be extracted based on various connection factors.
The VoIP administrator must configure a location map (called a wiremap) that will determine a caller's location.
This cmdlet removes a WAP from the location configuration database.
Removing the WAP will not remove the location associated with that WAP.
Use the `Remove-CsLisLocation` cmdlet to remove a location.

If you attempt to remove a WAP that does not exist, no action will be taken and you will not receive an error or a warning message.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Remove-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint -BSSID 99-99-99-99-99-99
```

Example 1 removes the LIS WAP location with the BSSID 99-99-99-99-99-99.

If this WAP was associated with a location, that location will not be removed, only the WAP will be removed from the location mapping.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint | Where-Object {$_.Location -like "*Bldg30*"} | Remove-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint
```

This example removes all WAPs in building 30.
The example begins with a call to the `Get-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint` cmdlet, which returns a collection of all WAPs.
This collection is piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which finds the items in that collection that have a Location property that contains the string Bldg30 anywhere in the value; in other words, a Location that is like (-like) Bldg30.
Finally, we pipe this collection of WAPs in building 30 to the `Remove-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint` cmdlet, which removes everything in that collection.

Note that, as in Example 1, no locations are removed from the location configuration database, only the WAPs that reference those locations are removed.
