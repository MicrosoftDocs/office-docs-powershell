examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Enable-CsPublicProvider -Identity "Skype"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 enables the public provider with the Identity Skype.
    This command will return an error if Skype is already enabled.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsPublicProvider | Where-Object {$_.Enabled -eq $False} | Enable-CsPublicProvider
  description: |-
    Example 2 enables all the public providers that are currently disabled.
    In order to carry out this task, the command first uses the Get-CsPublicProvider cmdlet to return a collection of all the public providers configured for use in the organization.
    That collection is piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those providers where the Enabled property is equal to False.
    The filtered collection is then piped to the Enable-CsPublicProvider cmdlet, which enables each provider in the collection.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsPublicProvider | Where-Object {$_.VerificationLevel -eq "AlwaysVerifiable" -and $_.Enabled -eq $False} | Enable-CsPublicProvider
  description: |-
    Example 3 enables all the public providers that are not currently enabled, provided the verification level of those providers is set to AlwaysVerifiable.
    To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsPublicProvider cmdlet to return a collection of all the public providers currently in use in the organization.
    This collection is piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out those providers that meet two criteria: 1) the VerificationLevel property is equal to AlwaysVerifiable; and, 2) the Enabled property is equal to False.
    (The -and operator tells the Where-Object cmdlet that objects must meet all the specified criteria in order to be selected.) This filtered collection is then piped to the Enable-CsPublicProvider cmdlet, which enables each provider in the collection.

  Federation is a means by which two organizations can set up a trust relationship that facilitates communication between the two groups.
  When federation has been established, users in the two organizations can send each other instant messages, subscribe for presence notifications, and otherwise communicate with one another using SIP applications such as Skype for Business.
  Skype for Business Server allows for three types of federation: 1) direct federation between your organization and another; 2) federation between your organization and a public provider; and, 3) federation between your organization and a third-party hosting provider.

  A public provider is an organization which provides SIP communication services for the general public.
  When you establish a federation relationship with a public provider, you effectively establish federation with any user who has an account hosted by that provider.
  For example, if you federate with Skype your users will be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with anyone who has a Skype instant messaging account.

  In order to federate with a public provider you need to create and enable a new public provider.
  (In addition, the public provider will need to create a federation relationship with you.) Public providers can be enabled at the time they are created, or they can be enabled after-the-fact by using the Enable-CsPublicProvider cmdlet.

  By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Enable-CsPublicProvider cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
  To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

  `Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Enable-CsPublicProvider"}`
