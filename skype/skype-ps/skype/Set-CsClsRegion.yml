  The centralized logging service (which replaces the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides a way for administrators to manage logging and tracing for all computers and pools running Skype for Business Server.
  Centralized logging enables administrators to stop, start and configure logging for one or more pools and computers by using a single command; for example, you can use one command to enable Address Book service logging on all your Address Book servers.
  This differs from the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools, which had to be individually managed (including individually stopped and started) on each server.
  In addition, the centralized logging service also provides a way for administrators to search trace logs from the command, using the Windows PowerShell command-line interface and the `Search-CsClsLogging` cmdlet.

  With Skype for Business Online, regions are used to determine which users have access to the personally-identifiable information that is written to the log files.
  Regions are created by using the `New-CsClsRegion` cmdlet and then are added to a collection of centralized logging configuration settings.
  After they have been created, you can modify the properties of these regions by using the `Set-CsClsRegion` cmdlet.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `Set-CsClsRegion` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
