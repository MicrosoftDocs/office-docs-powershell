    The command shown in Example 2 removes all the Persistent Chat add-ins currently in use in the organization.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsPersistentChatAddin` cmdlet to return a collection of all the Persistent Chat add-ins currently in use.
    This collection is piped to the `Remove-CsPersistentChatAddin` cmdlet, which then deletes each add-in in the collection.

  The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
  Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
  Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

  Add-ins serve as extensions to a Persistent Chat chat room.
  Add-ins are external applications (that is, items not built into Persistent Chat itself) that are associated with a particular chat room.
  For example, a help desk chat room might include a URL that links to a Web page or to a Silverlight application that shows the status of the day's help requests.
  The Skype for Business Server Windows PowerShell command-line interface cmdlets do not provide the ability to create these add-ins.
  Instead, the CsPersistentChatAddin cmdlets are used to associate (or disassociate) an add-in from a chat room.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: To remove a Persistent Chat add-in using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click Persistent Chat and then click Add-in.
  Select the add-in to be removed, click Edit and then click Delete.
