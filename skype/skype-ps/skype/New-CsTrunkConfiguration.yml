    New-CsTrunkConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond

    This example creates a new trunk configuration with the Identity site:Redmond.
    The remaining properties for this new configuration will be populated with default values.

  code: |-
    New-CsTrunkConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -EnableBypass $True
  description: |-
    This example creates a new trunk configuration with the Identity site:Redmond and enables media bypass.
    Media bypass is enabled by assigning the value $True to the EnableBypass parameter.
    The remaining properties for this new configuration will be populated with default values.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    New-CsTrunkConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond

    New-CsOutboundTranslationRule -Identity site:Redmond/OTR1 -Pattern '^\+(\d{8})$' -Translation '9$1'
  description: |-
    This example creates a new trunk configuration with the Identity site:Redmond and then assigns a new outbound translation to that trunk.
    The first line of the example calls the `New-CsTrunkConfiguration` cmdlet to create the new trunk configuration with default settings.
    The second line calls the `New-CsOutboundTranslationRule` cmdlet.
    Notice the value assigned to the Identity: site:Redmond/OTR1.
    The first part of the Identity (site:Redmond) defines the scope at which the rule is applied.
    This scope matches the Identity of the new trunk configuration, which means this rule will automatically be applied to that configuration.
    The scope is followed by a slash (/) then a string, which is simply a unique name for this rule (there can be more than one rule per scope).
    After that we pass values to the Pattern and Translation parameters to define this rule.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ConcentratedTopology
  description: |+
    The value of this parameter determines whether there is a well-known media termination point.
    (An example of a well-known media termination point would be a PSTN gateway where the media termination has the same IP as the signaling termination.) Set this value to False if the trunk does not have a well-known media termination point.

  name: Enable3pccRefer
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the 3pcc protocol can be used to allow transferred calls to bypass the hosted site.
    3pcc is also known as "third party control," and occurs when a third-party is used to connect a pair of callers (for example, an operator placing a call from person A to person B).
    The REFER method is a standard SIP method which indicates that the recipient should contact a third-party by using information supplied by the sender.
    The default value is False ($False).

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnableBypass
  description: |+
    The value of this parameter determines whether media bypass is enabled for this trunk.
    Set this value to True to enable bypass.
    Note that in order for the media bypass to work successfully, certain capabilities must be supported by PSTN gateways, SBCs and PBXs, including:

    - The ability to receive forked responses to an Invite.
    - Skype for Business Server clients and the media termination point must be able to communicate directly without going through a Mediation Server.
    - The gateway subnet must be defined as being at the same site as the client's subnet or, if at a different site, the sites must not be separated by WAN links with constrained bandwidth.

    Media bypass can be enabled only under the following circumstances:

    - The ConcentratedTopology parameter is set to True
    - The EnableReferSupport parameter is set to False and RTCPActiveCalls and RTCPCallsOnHold are set to False, or EnableReferSupport is set to True

    Note that if EnableBypass is True and EnableReferSupport is False, bypass calls that are subsequently transferred will become non-bypass.

    For media bypass to work for a particular trunk, it needs to be enabled globally as well as for the trunk in question.
    Use the `New-CsNetworkMediaBypassConfiguration` cmdlet to enable media bypass globally.

  name: EnableFastFailoverTimer
  description: |+
    When set to True, outbound calls that are not answered by the gateway within 10 seconds will be routed to the next available trunk; if there are no additional trunks then the call will automatically be dropped.
    In an organization with slow networks and gateway responses, that could potentially result in calls being dropped unnecessarily.

    The default value is True.

  name: EnableLocationRestriction
  description: |+
    When set to True, location-based voice routing will be enabled for calls passing through the SIP trunks managed by the specified collection of SIP trunk configuration settings.
    With location-based voice routing, the locations of both the user making the call and the user receiving the call are taken into account when calls are routed.
    If this property is set to True (the default value is False) then you should also set the NetworkSiteId property.

    Session timers are used to determine whether a particular session is still active.

    Note that even if this parameter is set to False, session timers can be applicable if the remote connection has session timer enabled.
    In such a case, the Mediation Server will reply to session timer probes from the remote entity.

    If an anonymous call is forwarded to an outgoing PSTN call, this parameter indicates whether the incoming P-Asserted-Identity (PAI) header at the Gateway call will be preserved in the PSTN call. The default value is **False** ($False).

    **Notes:**
    - `EnablePAIPAssthrough` is deprecated in favor of `ForwardAnonymousCallGatewayPAI`. This change is made by installing KB5016483.

  description: |+
    This parameter determines whether RTCP packets are sent from the PSTN gateway, IP-PBX, or SBC at the service provider for active calls.
    An active call in this context is a call where media is allowed to flow in at least one direction.
    If RTCPActiveCalls is set to True, the Mediation Server or Skype for Business Server client can terminate a call if it does not receive RTCP packets for a period exceeding 30 seconds.

    Note that disabling the checks for received RTCP media for active calls in Skype for Business Server elements removes an important safeguard for detecting a dropped peer and should be done only if necessary.

    This parameter determines whether RTCP packets continue to be sent across the trunk for calls that have been placed on hold and no media packets are expected to flow in either direction.
    If Music on Hold is enabled at either the Skype for Business Server client or the trunk, the call will be considered to be active and this property will be ignored.
    In these circumstances use the RTCPActiveCalls parameter.

    These rules allow the administrator to map SIP response codes with values between 400 and 699 received over a trunk to new values more consistent with Skype for Business Server.

    You can create this list and corresponding rules directly with this cmdlet.
    However, it is recommended that you create the SIP response code translation rules by calling the `New-CsSipResponseCodeTranslationRule` cmdlet.
    That cmdlet will create the rule and assign it to the trunk configuration with the matching scope.

    For media bypass cases, this value must be compatible with the EncryptionLevel setting in the media configuration.
    Media configuration is set by using the `New-CsMediaConfiguration` cmdlet and the `Set-CsMediaConfiguration` cmdlet.

    Valid values:

    - Required: SRTP encryption must be used.
    - Optional: SRTP will be used if the gateway supports it.
    - NotSupported: SRTP encryption is not supported and therefore will not be used.

    Note: SRTPMode is used only if the gateway is configured to use Transport Layer Security (TLS).
    If the gateway is configured with Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as the transport, SRTPMode is internally set to NotSupported.
