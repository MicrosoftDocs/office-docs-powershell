    Disable-CsAdForest
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 rolls back the forest preparation tasks carried out by the Enable-CsAdForest cmdlet.
    Because the Force parameter is not included, the command will fail if the Disable-CsAdForest cmdlet detects that at least one of the domains in the forest is still prepared for Skype for Business Server.
    In that case, you will need to rolls back the domain preparation by running the Disable-CsAdDomain cmdlet.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Disable-CsAdForest -Force
  description: |-
    In Example 2, forest preparation is rolled back even if the Disable-CsAdForest cmdlet detects that at least one of the domains in the forest is still prepared for Skype for Business Server.
    Rollback is forced by including the Force parameter.

description: |-
  When you install Skype for Business Server, you make a number of forest-level changes to Active Directory Domain Services.
  These changes (which can be carried out by using the Enable-CsAdForest cmdlet) include creating objects and display specifiers that are specific to Skype for Business Server 2015, creating universal security groups needed to manage Skype for Business Server, and granting global settings object access administrative rights and permissions to these groups.

  If you later decide to uninstall Skype for Business Server (or if you encounter issues during the setup process) you might need to roll back these forest-level changes.
  The Disable-CsAdForest cmdlet provides a way for you to undo all the forest-level modifications made by the Enable-CsAdForest cmdlet.

  You must be an enterprise administrator in order to run the Disable-CsAdForest cmdlet locally.

  Historical Note: The tasks carried out by Disable-CsAdForest are similar to the tasks carried out by the following Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 command: `Lcscmd.exe /forest /action:ForestUnprep`
