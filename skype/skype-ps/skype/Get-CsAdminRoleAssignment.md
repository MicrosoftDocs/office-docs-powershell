# Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment

## SYNOPSIS
Returns the role-based access control (RBAC) roles assigned to a user.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment [-Identity] <String> [-Force] [-LocalStore] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Role-based access control (RBAC) enables administrators to delegate control of specific management tasks for Skype for Business Server.
For example, instead of granting your organization's help desk full administrator privileges you can give these employees very specific rights: the right to manage only user accounts; the right to manage only Enterprise Voice components; and the right to manage only archiving and Archiving Server.
In addition, these rights can be limited in scope: one user can be given the right to manage Enterprise Voice, but only in the Redmond site; while another user can be given the right to manage user accounts, but only if those accounts are in the Finance organizational unit (OU).

The Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment cmdlet provides a way for you to retrieve a list of the RBAC roles that have been assigned to a user.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment -Identity "kenmyer"
```

The command shown in Example 1 returns all of the RBAC roles assigned to the user kenmyer.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsUser | ForEach-Object {$_.DisplayName; Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment -Identity $_.SamAccountName}
```

Example 2 returns the RBAC roles for all of the users who have been enabled for Skype for Business Server.
To do this, the command begins by calling the Get-CsUser cmdlet without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the users in the organization who have been enabled for Skype for Business Server.
This data is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which loops through each user account in the collection and does the following: 1) echoes the user's display name to the screen; and 2) uses the Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment cmdlet to return the user's RBAC roles.
The user account information must be piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet because the Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment cmdlet does not directly accept pipelined data.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
SamAccountName of the user whose RBAC roles are to be returned, You can retrieve the SamAccountName for a user by using a command similar to this:

`Get-CsUser "Ken Myer" | Select-Object SamAccountName`

Note that you must use the SamAccountName when specifying the user Identity.
Other common values used when specifying identities, such as the Active Directory display name or the user's SIP address, will not work with Get-CsAdminRoleAssignment.
