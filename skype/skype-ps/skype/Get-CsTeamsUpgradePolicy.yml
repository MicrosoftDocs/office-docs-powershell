  TeamsUpgradePolicy allows administrators to manage the transition from Skype for Business to Teams. This cmdlet returns the set of instances of this policy. As an organization with Skype for Business starts to adopt Teams, administrators can manage the user experience in their organization using the concept of coexistence "mode". Mode defines in which client incoming chats and calls land as well as in what service (Teams or Skype for Business) new meetings are scheduled in. Mode also governs whether chat, calling, and meeting scheduling functionality are available in the Teams client. Finally, prior to upgrading to TeamsOnly mode administrators can use TeamsUpgradePolicy to trigger notifications in the Skype for Business client to inform users of the pending upgrade. 

  NOTES: 
    - Except for on-premise versions of Skype for Business Server, all relevant instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy are built into the system, so there is no corresponding New cmdlet. 
    - If you are using Skype for Business Server, there are no built-in instances and you'll need to create one. Also, only the NotifySfBUsers property is available. Mode is not present.
    - Using TeamsUpgradePolicy in an on-premises environmention requires Skype for Business Server 2015 with CU8 or later.
