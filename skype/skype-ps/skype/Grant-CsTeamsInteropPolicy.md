# Grant-CsTeamsInteropPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

IMPORTANT: TeamsInteropPolicy has been replaced by TeamsUpgradePolicy. See description for more information. You can also find more guidance here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/migration-interop-guidance-for-teams-with-skype

This cmdlet previously determined how calls are routed between Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams. It is no longer honored, except if TeamsUpgradePolicy mode=Legacy. However, Legacy mode has been deprecated and customers should update their configurations to use a mode other than Legacy.


## SYNTAX

```
Grant-CsTeamsInteropPolicy [-PassThru] [-Confirm] [[-PolicyName] <Object>] [[-Identity] <Object>]
 [-Tenant <Object>] [-DomainController <Object>] [-WhatIf] [-AsJob]
```

## DESCRIPTION

IMPORTANT: TeamsInteropPolicy has been replaced by TeamsUpgradePolicy. It is no longer honored by the system, except if TeamsUpgradePolicy has mode=Legacy.  Legacy mode is being deprecated. Customers that are still using Legacy mode should update their configurations to use a mode other than Legacy.  Granting mode=Legacy is now blocked by default, although admins can override this using -Force for the time being. Eventually, the -Force switch will be removed and granting mode=Legacy will not be possible.

Any customers still using Legacy mode must ensure the following:

 - The global policy must have CallingDefaultClient=ChatDefaultClient, and AllowEndUserClientOverride must be false.  If you customized the built-in global policy, undo this by running `Remove-CsTeamsInteropPolicy`. This will remove the tenant-specific global policy and revert back to the system-wide built-in policy (which cannot be removed). Use the following syntax: `Remove-CsTeamsInteropPolicy -Identity Global`.

 - If TeamsInteropPolicy is explicitly assigned to any users, one of these three built-in instances for which CallingDefaultClient = ChatDefaultClient, and for which AllowEndUserClientOverride = false. The other instances are no longer valid configurations, are not supported, and will soon be removed from the system.  The valid instances are:

**Identity: DisallowOverrideCallingDefaultChatDefault**   
**AllowEndUserClientOverride: False**   
**CallingDefaultClient: Default**   
**ChatDefaultClient: Default**

**Identity: DisallowOverrideCallingSfbChatSfb**   
**AllowEndUserClientOverride: False**   
**CallingDefaultClient: Sfb**   
**ChatDefaultClient: Sfb**

**Identity: DisallowOverrideCallingTeamsChatTeams**   
**AllowEndUserClientOverride: False**   
**CallingDefaultClient: Teams**     
**ChatDefaultClient: Teams**

Use the following cmdlet syntax, where $policy is one of the above values of identity: `Grant-CsTeamsInteropPolicy -PolicyName $policy -Identity $SipAddress`.

For comprehensive documentation on this policy and its settings, see [Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Interoperability](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-and-skypeforbusiness-interoperability).

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Grant-CsTeamsInteropPolicy -PolicyName DisallowOverrideCallingDefaultChatDefault -Identity user@contoso.com
```

**Default Policy**

By default, Microsoft Teams is configured to ensure that existing Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams calling workloads remain distinct and separate. 
This is a safe configuration for organizations just beginning to experiment with Teams Calling.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Grant-CsTeamsInteropPolicy -PolicyName DisallowOverrideCallingTeamsChatTeams -Identity user@contoso.com
```

**Policy to enable all inbound calls and chats to be routed to Microsoft Teams (assumed Mode=Legacy)**

Users who have calling plans and would like to receive their calls in Microsoft Teams can have their calls routed to Teams.
