# Grant-CsTeamsInteropPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

IMPORTANT: TeamsInteropPolicy has been replaced by TeamsUpgradePolicy. See description for more information. You can also find more guidance here: [Migration and interoperability guidance for organizations using Teams together with Skype for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/migration-interop-guidance-for-teams-with-skype).



## SYNTAX

```
Grant-CsTeamsInteropPolicy [-PassThru] [-Confirm] [[-PolicyName] <Object>] [[-Identity] <Object>]
 [-Tenant <Object>] [-DomainController <Object>] [-WhatIf] [-AsJob]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet previously determined how calls are routed between Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams, in cases where TeamsUpgradePolicy had mode=Legacy.

IMPORTANT: TeamsInteropPolicy has been replaced by TeamsUpgradePolicy, and Legacy mode has been retired. TeamsInteropPolicy is no longer honored by the system.  For comprehensive documentation on this policy and its settings, see [Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Interoperability](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-and-skypeforbusiness-interoperability).
