    New-CsPublicProvider -Identity "Fabrikam" -ProxyFqdn "proxyserver.fabrikam.com" -Enabled $True
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 creates a new federation relationship with a public provider that has the Identity Fabrikam.
    In addition to specifying the Identity, two other property values (and their corresponding parameters) must be set: ProxyFqdn (set to proxyserver.fabrikam.com) and Enabled (which, in this case, is set to True).
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $x = New-CsPublicProvider -Identity "Fabrikam" -ProxyFqdn "proxyserver.fabrikam.com" -Enabled $True -InMemory

    $x.VerificationLevel = "AlwaysUnverifiable"

    Set-CsPublicProvider -Instance $x
  description: |-
    Example 2 demonstrates how you can create a new public provider in memory only, modify the properties of that provider, then turn the virtual provider into a real provider that can be used in your organization.
    To do this, the first command in the example creates a public provider with the Identity Fabrikam.
    In addition to including the required parameters (Identity, ProxyFqdn, and Enabled), the command adds the InMemory parameter; this creates an in-memory-only instance of the provider that is then stored in a variable named $x.

    After the in-memory instance of the provider has been created the second command in the example modifies the VerificationLevel of the virtual provider.
    The final command then uses the Set-CsPublicProvider cmdlet to turn the virtual provider (stored in $x) into an actual public provider.
    If you do not call the Set-CsPublicProvider cmdlet the real provider will not be created.
    In turn, the virtual provider will disappear the moment you end your Windows PowerShell session or delete the variable $x.

  name: VerificationLevel
  description: |+
    Indicates how (or if) messages sent from a public provider are verified to ensure that they were sent from that provider.
    The VerificationLevel must be set to one of the following values:

    AlwaysVerifiable.
    All messages purportedly sent from this provider will be accepted.
    If a verification header is not found in the message it will be added by Skype for Business Server.
    This is the default value.

    AlwaysUnverifiable.
    All messages purportedly sent from a public provider are considered unverified.
    They will be delivered only if they were sent from a person who is on the recipient's Contacts list.
    For example, if Ken Myer is on your Contacts list you will be able to receive messages from him.
    If Pilar Ackerman is not on your Contacts list then you will not be able to receive messages from her.
    Note that Skype for Business users can manually override this setting, thereby allowing themselves to receive messages people not on their Contacts list.

    UseSourceVerification.
    Uses the verification header added to the message by the public provider.
    If the verification information is missing the message will be rejected.
    This value has been deprecated for use in Skype for Business Server.

  Federation is a means by which two organizations can set up a trust relationship that facilitates communication between the two groups.
  When a federation has been established, users in the two organizations can send each other instant messages, subscribe for presence notifications, and otherwise communicate with one another using SIP applications such as Skype for Business.
  Skype for Business Server allows for three types of federation: 1) direct federation between your organization and another; 2) federation between your organization and a public provider; and, 3) federation between your organization and a third-party hosting provider.

  A public provider is an organization which provides SIP communication services for the general public.
  When you establish a federation relationship with a public provider, you effectively establish federation with any user who has an account hosted by that provider.
  For example, if you federate with Skype your users will be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with anyone who has a Skype instant messaging account.

  In order to federate with a public provider you need to create and enable a new public provider.
  (In addition, the public provider will need to create a federation relationship with you.) The Set-CsPublicProvider enables you to modify property values for any of the public providers that have been configured for use in your organization.

  Note that you cannot federate with a public provider if your Edge servers are configured to use default routing rather than DNS server routing.
