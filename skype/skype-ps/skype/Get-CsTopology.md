# Get-CsTopology

## SYNOPSIS
Returns information about your Skype for Business Server infrastructure, including internal domains, sites, clusters, computers, services, and back-end instances of SQL Server.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Get-CsTopology [-AsXml] [-LocalStore] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-CsTopology cmdlet returns information about how Skype for Business Server has been set up and configured.
Called without any additional parameters, the cmdlet provides an overview of your Skype for Business Server infrastructure; in that scenario, the cmdlet gives you an overall view of such things as your domains, your sites, and the computers running Skype for Business Server services and server roles.
Alternatively, you can pass the output of the Get-CsTopology cmdlet to the Select-Object cmdlet; this enables you to access detailed information about a portion of your topology.
For example, the following command provides detailed information regarding the SQL Server instances used by Skype for Business Server:

`Get-CsTopology | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SqlInstances`

You can also use the AsXml parameter to return detailed information about your entire topology in XML format.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-CsTopology
```

Example 1 returns complete details for your Skype for Business Server topology.
This is done by calling the Get-CsTopology cmdlet without any additional parameters.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsTopology | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Machines
```

Example 2 returns information about the computers found in your Skype for Business Server topology.
To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsTopology cmdlet to return the complete Skype for Business Server topology.
This information is then piped to the Select-Object cmdlet, which uses the ExpandProperty parameter to extract and display detailed information for all the computers included in that topology.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsTopology -AsXML | Out-File C:\Logs\Topology.xml
```

The command shown in Example 3 returns information about your Skype for Business Server topology and then saves that information to an XML file.
To carry out this task, the command first calls the Get-CsTopology cmdlet, along with the AsXml parameter; that causes the data to be returned as formatted XML.
That formatted data is then piped to the Out-File cmdlet, which saves the information to the file C:\Logs\Topology.xml.


## PARAMETERS

### -AsXml
Returns topology information in XML format.
By combining the Get-CsTopology cmdlet, the AsXml parameter, and the Out-File cmdlet, you can export your topology to an XML file.
