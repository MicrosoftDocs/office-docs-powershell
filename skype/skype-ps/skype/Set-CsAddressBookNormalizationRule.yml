    None.
    Instead, the `Set-CsAddressBookNormalizationRule` cmdlet modifies existing instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Settings.AddressBook.AddressBookNormalizationRule#Decorated object.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsAddressBookNormalizationRule -Identity "Global/RedmondAddresses" -Priority 1
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 changes the priority of the RedmondAddresses normalization rule found in the global collection of Address Book normalization rules.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsAddressBookNormalizationRule | Where-Object {$_.Translation -eq '+1206556$1'} | Set-CsAddressBookNormalizationRule -Translation '+1425556$1'
  description: |-
    In Example 2, all the normalization rules that use the Translation +12065556$1 are updated to use the Translation +14255556$1; this might be required if an area code changes from 206 to 425.
    To carry out this task, the `Get-CsAddressBookNormalizationRule` cmdlet is called in order to return a collection of all the available normalization rules.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those rules that have a Translation equal to +12065556$1.
    Those rules are then piped to the `Set-CsAddressBookTranslationRule`, which changes the Translation for each of these rules to +14255556$1.

  name: Identity
  description: |+
    A unique identifier for the rule.
    The Identity specified must include the scope followed by a slash followed by the name; for example: site:Redmond/Rule1, where site:Redmond is the scope and Rule1 is the name.

  name: Pattern
  description: |+
    A regular expression that the phone number must match in order for this rule to be applied.

    The default value is ^(\d{11})$.
    This represents any set of numbers up to 11 digits.

  name: Priority
  description: |+
    The order in which rules are applied; this is required because a given phone number might match more than one rule.
    The Priority parameter sets the order in which the rules are tested against a number.
    If a phone number matches multiple rules, the rule with the highest priority will be selected to do the conversion.

    Note that, when you set a priority, any existing rules will renumber themselves accordingly.

  name: Translation
  description: |+
    The regular expression pattern that will be applied to the number to convert it to E.164 format.

    The default value is +$.
    This prefixes the number with a plus sign (+).

description: |-
  Normalization rules define the requirements for converting (or translating) numbers from an internal Skype for Business Server format to a standard (E.164) format.
  (Note that an understanding of regular expressions is helpful in order to understand what normalization rules do and how they do it.) Address Book normalization rules carry out these conversions and translations for Address Book servers.

  Although Address Book normalization rules are very similar to voice normalization rules, the two are not interchangeable: you cannot add voice normalization rules to an Address Book collection, nor can you add Address Book normalization rules to a dial plan.
  That means, in some cases, you might need to create identical rules: one for assignment to Address Book servers, the other for assignment to dial plans.
