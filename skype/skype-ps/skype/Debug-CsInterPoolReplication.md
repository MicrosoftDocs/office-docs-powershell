# Debug-CsInterPoolReplication


## SYNOPSIS
Verifies that replication is working between a Registrar pool and its assigned backup pool.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.


## SYNTAX

```
Debug-CsInterPoolReplication -PoolFqdn <Fqdn> [-BackupModule <BackupModules>] [-Force] [-Confirm]
 [-DatabaseCommandTimeoutInSeconds <Int32>] [-ResyncSignatureMismatchItems] [-SuppressMultiMasterDetection]
 [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
In Skype for Business Server each Registrar pool can be associated with a backup pool.
The backup pool maintains a copy of all the data stored on the primary pool.
Should the primary pool become unavailable then users of that pool can automatically be "failed over" to the backup pool.
This enables those users to continue to use Skype for Business Server even though their home pool is not available.
The Debug-CsInterPoolReplication cmdlet is used to compare the data stores on a primary pool and its backup pool, and thus verify that replication between the two pools is working as expected.

Note that this command will fail if the pool being tested has not been assigned a backup pool.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

`Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Debug-CsInterPoolReplication"}`

The functions carried out by the Debug-CsInterPoolReplication cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Debug-CsInterPoolReplication -PoolFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

The command shown in Example 1 verifies the full replication status between the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com and its previously-assigned backup pool.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Debug-CsInterPoolReplication -PoolFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -BackupModule DataConf
```

In Example 2, only the replication of data conferencing data is verified between the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com and its previously-assigned backup pool.
