    Set-CsUnassignedNumber -Identity UNSet1 -NumberRangeStart "+14255551000" -NumberRangeEnd "+14255551900"
  description: |-
    This example modifies the unassigned number range with the name UNSet1.
    We first pass the Identity parameter the value UNSet1, the name of the unassigned number range we want to modify.
    We then use the NumberRangeStart (+14255551000) and NumberRangeEnd (+14255551900) parameters to modify the range of unassigned numbers to which the specified announcement or Auto Attendant will apply.

  code: |-
    Get-CsUnassignedNumber | Where-Object {$_.AnnouncementName -match "Welcome"} | Set-CsUnassignedNumber -AnnouncementService ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com -AnnouncementName "Help Desk Announcement"
  description: |-
    This example modifies the Announcement of all unassigned number range settings that currently have an Announcement with the string "Welcome" in the name.
    First we call the `Get-CsUnassignedNumber` cmdlet to retrieve all unassigned number settings.
    We pipe that collection of settings to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which narrows down the collection to only those settings where the AnnouncementName property contains (-match) the string Welcome.
    Once we have those settings, we pipe them to the `Set-CsUnassignedNumber` cmdlet, where we modify the Application Server ID of the Announcement Service (ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com) with the AnnouncementService parameter and the name of the new announcement (Help Desk Announcement) with the AnnouncementName parameter.
    Note that even if the new Announcement has a different name but the same service ID, you must still specify the service ID along with the name.

description: |-
  Unassigned numbers are phone numbers that have been assigned to an organization but that have not been assigned to specific users or phones.
  Skype for Business Server can be set up to route calls to appropriate destinations when an unassigned number is called.
  This cmdlet modifies the settings that define that routing.

  In order to modify some of the settings for this cmdlet, your system must already either have Announcements defined or an Exchange Auto Attendant set up.
  To determine whether you have Announcements, call the `Get-CsAnnouncement` cmdlet.
  To create a new Announcement, call the `New-CsAnnouncement` cmdlet.
  To check Exchange Auto Attendant settings, run the `Get-CsExUmContact` cmdlet.
