# New-CsXmppAllowedPartner

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a new XMPP allowed partner.
The extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open-standard communications protocol for exchanging messages using XML.
An allowed partner is an IM and presence provider whose users have been authorized to exchange instant messages and presence information with your Skype for Business Server users.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.

## DESCRIPTION
The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a standard communications protocol (based on XML) used for sending messages across the Internet.
XMPP was originally named Jabber and is supported by a number of Internet messaging and communication applications, including Google Talk and Facebook Chat.

In order for your users to be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with users on an XMPP network, that network must be configured as an XMPP allowed partner.
(You must also assign your users an external access policy that allows XMPP access.) By design, your users will be allowed to communicate with users on any XMPP network that is listed on the allowed partners list.
If you do not want users communicating with users from a given network then you must delete that network from the allowed partners list.

Skype for Business Server Control Panel: To create a new XMPP allowed partner using Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click External User Access, click XMPP Federated Partners and then click New.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
New-CsXmppAllowedPartner -Identity "contoso.com" -PartnerType "PublicVerified"
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new XMPP allowed partner: contoso.com.
In this example, the PartnerType property is set to "PublicVerified".


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
New-CsXmppAllowedPartner -Identity "fabrikam.com" -AdditionalDomains "research.fabrikam2.com"
```

Example 2 creates a new XMPP allowed partner with the Identity fabrikam.com.
In addition to the root domain (fabrikam.com), the AdditionalDomains property is included to allow support for the child domain research.fabrikam2.com.


## PARAMETERS

### -Domain
Primary domain of the XMPP allowed partner; for example:

### -EnableKeepAlive
Indicates whether or not the XMPP partner should periodically transmit "keep alive" packets in order to verify that the connection is still active.

```

### -InMemory
Creates an object reference without actually committing the object as a permanent change.

Federated (the XMPP partner is from a federated domain)

PublicVerified

PublicUnverified

The default value is PublicUnverified.


```yaml
Type: PartnerType
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False

### -SaslNegotiation
Indicates support for the Simple Authentication and Security Layer protocol, a protocol used for server authentication.

Required (SASL negotiation must be supported)

Optional (SASL will be used if available)

NotSupported (SASL negotiation will not be supported)

The default value is Required.

### -SupportDialbackNegotiation
Indicates whether dialback negotiation will be supported.
With dialback negotiation, when Server A contacts Server B communication is not immediately established.
Instead, Server B first attempts to verify the identity of Server A by contacting the authoritative DNS server for the domain that Server A claims to be from.

Note that dialback negotiation is not as secure as SASL or TLS.
Instead, it is primarily used in situations where certificates cannot be used to verify a server's identity.

The default value is True.

Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019
