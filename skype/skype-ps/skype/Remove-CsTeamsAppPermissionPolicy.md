# Remove-CsTeamsAppPermissionPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

As an admin, you can use app permission policies to enable or block specific apps for your users.  Learn more about the App Permission Policies: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-app-permission-policies.

**We require that all creation and modification of app permission polices (not including the assignment or removal of policies from users) happens in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center to ensure that the policy matches your expectations for the end user experience.**

This cmdlet allows you to remove app permission policies that have been created within your organization.  If you run Remove-CsTeamsAppPermissionPolicy on the Global policy, it will be reset to the defaults provided for new organizations.

## DESCRIPTION

**We require that all creation and modification of app permission polices (not including the assignment or removal of policies from users) happens in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center to ensure that the policy matches your expectations for the end user experience.**

This cmdlet allows you to remove app permission policies that have been created within your organization.  If you run Remove-CsTeamsAppPermissionPolicy on the Global policy, it will be reset to the defaults provided for new organizations.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-CsTeamsAppPermissionPolicy -Identity SalesPolicy
```

Deletes a custom policy that has already been created in the organization.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the policy to be removed.
To "remove" the global policy, use the following syntax: `-Identity global`.
(Note that the global policy cannot actually be removed.  Instead, all the properties in that policy will be reset to their default values.) To remove a per-user policy, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity "SalesDepartmentPolicy"`.
You cannot use wildcards when specifying a policy Identity.
