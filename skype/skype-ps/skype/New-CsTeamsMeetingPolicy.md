## DESCRIPTION
The CsTeamsMeetingPolicy cmdlets enable administrators to control the type of meetings that users can create or the features that they can access while in a meeting. It also helps determine how meetings deal with anonymous or external users

The New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy cmdlet allows administrators to define new meeting policies that can be assigned to particular users to control Teams features related to meetings.
## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 -------------------------- 
```

New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity SalesMeetingPolicy -AllowTranscription $false
```

The command shown in Example 1 uses the New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy cmdlet to create a new meeting policy with the Identity SalesMeetingPolicy.
This policy will use all the default values for a meeting policy except one: AllowTranscription; in this example, meetings for users with this policy can include real time or post meeting captions and transcriptions.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 -------------------------- 
```

New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity HrMeetingPolicy -AutoAdmittedUsers "Everyone" -AllowMeetNow $False
```

In Example 2, the New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy cmdlet is used to create a meeting policy with the Identity HrMeetingPolicy.
In this example two different property values are configured: AutoAdmittedUsers is set to Everyone and AllowMeetNow is set to False.
All other policy properties will use the default values.
