### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Modifies property values for a domain (or domains) included on the list of domains approved for federation.
  After a domain has been approved for federation (by being added to the allowed list), your users can exchange instant messages and presence information with people who have accounts in the federated domain.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.
module: SkypeForBusiness

    Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Settings.Edge.AllowedDomain object.
    The `Set-CsAllowedDomain` cmdlet accepts pipelined instances of the allowed domain object.
outputs:
- name: <xref href=" " data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    The `Set-CsAllowedDomain` cmdlet does not return a value or object.
    Instead, the cmdlet configures instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Settings.Edge.AllowedDomain object.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsAllowedDomain -Identity fabrikam.com -Comment "Contact: Ken Myer (kenmyer@fabrikam.com)"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 modifies the Comment property for the allowed domain with the Identity "fabrikam.com".
    This is done by including the Comment parameter and the appropriate parameter value: "Contact: Ken Myer (kenmyer@fabrikam.com)".
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsAllowedDomain -Filter *fabrikam* | Set-CsAllowedDomain -Comment "Contact: Ken Myer (kenmyer@fabrikam.com)"
  description: |-
    Example 2 modifies the Comment property for all of the allowed domains that have the string value "fabrikam" somewhere in their Identity.
    To carry out this task, the command first calls the `Get-CsAllowedDomain` cmdlet and the Filter parameter.
    The filter value "*fabrikam*" instructs the `Get-CsAllowedDomain` cmdlet to return any domain where the Identity includes the string value "fabrikam".
    (For example, this command returns domains such as fabrikam.com, us.fabrikam.net and fabrikam-users.org).
    The filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsAllowedDomain` cmdlet, which modifies for Comment property.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsAllowedDomain | Where-Object {$_.Comment -eq $Null} | Set-CsAllowedDomain -Comment "Need contact information."
  description: |-
    Example 3 adds a generic comment ("Need contact information.") to each domain on the allowed list where the Comment property currently has no value.
    To carry out this task, the command first calls the `Get-CsAllowedDomain` cmdlet to retrieve a collection of all the domains on the allowed list.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out those domains where the Comment property is equal to a null value.
    That filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsAllowedDomain` cmdlet, which modifies the Comment property for each item in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsAllowedDomain | Where-Object {$_.Comment -eq $Null} | Set-CsAllowedDomain -Comment "Need contact information."
  description: |-
    Example 4 adds a generic comment ("Need contact information.") to each domain on the allowed list where the Comment property currently has no value.
    To carry out this task, the command first calls `Get-CsAllowedDomain` to retrieve a collection of all the domains on the allowed list.
    This collection is then piped to `Where-Object`, which picks out those domains where the Comment property is equal to a null value.
    That filtered collection is then piped to `Set-CsAllowedDomain`, which modifies the Comment property for each item in the collection.

  description: |+
    Indicates how (or if) messages sent from a domain are verified to ensure that they were sent from that domain.
    The VerificationLevel must be set to one of the following values:

    AlwaysVerifiable.
    All messages purportedly sent from this domain will be accepted.
    If a verification header is not found in the message it will be added by Skype for Business Server 2015.

    AlwaysUnverifiable.
    All messages purportedly sent from a domain are considered unverified.
    They will be delivered only if they were sent from a person who is on the recipient's Contacts list.
    For example, if Ken Myer is on your Contacts list you will be able to receive messages from him.
    If David Longmire is not on your Contacts list then you will not be able to receive messages from him.
    Note that Skype for Business users can manually override this setting, thereby allowing themselves to receive messages people not on their Contacts list.

    UseSourceVerification.
    Uses the verification header added to the message by the public provider.
    If the verification information is missing the message will be rejected.
    This is the default value.

description: |-
  Federation is a means by which two organizations can set up a trust relationship that facilitates communication between the two groups.
  When federation has been established, users in the two organizations can send each other instant messages, subscribe for presence notifications and otherwise communicate with one another by using SIP applications such as Skype for Business.
  Skype for Business Server allows for three types of federation: 1) direct federation between your organization and another; 2) federation between your organization and a public provider and 3) federation between your organization and a third-party hosting provider.

  Setting up direct federation with another organization involves several tasks.
  To begin with, you must enable your servers running the Skype for Business Server Access Edge service to allow federation.
  In addition, the other organization must enable federation with you; federation cannot be established unless both parties agree to the relationship.

  To set up a federated relationship you might also need to manage two federation-related lists: the allowed list and the blocked list.
  The allowed list represents the organizations you have chosen to federate with.
  If a domain appears on the allowed list then (depending on your configuration settings) your users will be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with users who have accounts in that federated domain.
  Conversely, the blocked list represents domains that users are expressly forbidden from federating with; for example, messages sent from a blocked domain will automatically be rejected by Skype for Business Server.

  The `Set-CsAllowedDomain` cmdlet provides a way for you to modify property values for any domain on the list of allowed domains.
