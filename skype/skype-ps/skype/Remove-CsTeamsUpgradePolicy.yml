summary: |-
  In on-premises deployments of Skype for Business Server, TeamsUpgradePolicy enables administrators to control whether users see a notification in their Skype for Business client of a pending upgrade to Teams. In addition, when this policy is assigned to a user, administrators can optionally have Win32 versions of Skype for Business clients silently download the Teams app based on the value of TeamsUpgradeConfiguration.

  In on-premises deployments of Skype for Business Server, TeamsUpgradePolicy enables administrators to control whether users see a notification of a pending upgrade to Teams in their Skype for Business client. The Remove-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy lets the administrator remove instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy that were previously created by the administrator.

  Instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy created  on-premises will not apply to any users that are already homed online. This cmdlet cannot be used to remove the built-in instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy provided in Office 365. There is no Remove-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy cmdlet for the online environment by design.
