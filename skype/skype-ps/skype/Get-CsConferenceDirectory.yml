- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsConferenceDirectory
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 returns information about all the conference directories configured for use in your organization.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsConferenceDirectory -Identity 2
  description: |-
    Example 2 returns information about the conference directory with the Identity 2.
    Because identities must be unique this command will never return more than a single conference directory.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsConferenceDirectory | Where-Object {$_.ServiceID -match "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"}
  description: |-
    Example 3 returns all the conference directories housed on the service UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsConferenceDirectory cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the conference directories found in your organization.
    This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those directories where the ServiceID matches the string value "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com".

    Enables you to use wildcards to specify the Identity of the conference directory (or directories) to be retrieved.

description: |-
  When you create a dial-in conferencing Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), those URIs are assigned unique SIP addresses.
  However, SIP addresses are difficult for devices that are not SIP-aware to translate; for example, a public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephone can't translate a SIP address.
  Because of that, Skype for Business Server uses conference directories as a way to help these devices locate, and connect to, dial-in conferences.
  This is done by creating a SIP conference directory that is associated with each dial-in conferencing URI, and is identified by an integer value rather than a SIP URI.
  PSTN telephones and other devices can use these numbers (rather than a SIP URI) when connecting to conferences; the directory number is included in the PSTN conference identification users enter when connecting to a dial-in conference.

  The Get-CsConferenceDirectory cmdlet enables you to return information about all the conference directories configured for use in your organization.
