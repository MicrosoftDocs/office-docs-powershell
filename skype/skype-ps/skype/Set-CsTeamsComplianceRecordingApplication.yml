  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="ComplianceRecordingPairedApplication" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ComplianceRecordingPairedApplications
  description: |+
    Determines the other policy-based recording applications to pair with this application to achieve application resiliency. Can only have one paired application.

    In situations where application resiliency is a necessity, invites can be sent to separate paired applications for the same call or meeting.
    If multiple such invites are accepted, then it means that multiple instances of this application are in the call or meeting and each of those instances can record independent of the others.

    If all of the invites are rejected, the application invitation process is deemed a failure and the other flags for this application control what happens next.
    Please refer to the documentation of the RequiredBeforeMeetingJoin and RequiredBeforeCallEstablishment parameters.

    If at least one of the invites is accepted and the others are rejected, the application invitation process is still deemed a success.

    If multiple invites are accepted and all of the instances leave or get dropped from the call or meeting, then the application is no longer in the call or meeting and the other flags for this application control what happens next.
    Please refer to the documentation of the RequiredDuringMeeting and RequiredDuringCall parameters.

    If multiple invites are accepted and at least one of the instances remains in the call or meeting, then the application is in the call or meeting.

    Note that application resiliency can be achieved either by sending multiple invites to the same application using ConcurrentInvitationCount or by sending invites to separate paired applications using ComplianceRecordingPairedApplications.
    However, you cannot do both.
    Please work with your Microsoft certified policy-based recording application provider to determine if application resiliency is needed for your workflows and how best to achieve application resiliency.

    Determines the number of invites to send out to the application instance of the policy-based recording application. Can be set to 1 or 2 only. 

    In situations where application resiliency is a necessity, multiple invites can be sent to the same application for the same call or meeting.
    If multiple such invites are accepted, then it means that multiple instances of this application are in the call or meeting and each of those instances can record independent of the others.

- type: <xref href="XdsIdentity" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    A name that uniquely identifies the application instance of the policy-based recording application.

    Application instances of policy-based recording applications must be associated with a Teams recording policy using the CsTeamsComplianceRecordingApplication cmdlets.
    To do this association correctly, the Identity of these application instances must be \<Identity of the associated Teams recording policy\>/\<ObjectId of the application instance\>.
    For example, the Identity of an application instance can be \"Tag:ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy/39dc3ede-c80e-4f19-9153-417a65a1f144\", which indicates that the application instance with ObjectId 39dc3ede-c80e-4f19-9153-417a65a1f144 is associated with the Teams recording policy with Identity ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Priority
  description: |+
    This priority determines the order in which the policy-based recording applications are displayed in the output of the Get-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy cmdlet.

    All policy-based recording applications are invited in parallel to ensure low call setup and meeting join latencies.
    So this parameter does not affect the order of invitations to the applications, or any other routing.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequiredBeforeCallEstablishment
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the policy-based recording application must be in the call before the call is allowed to establish.

    If this is set to True, the call will be cancelled if the policy-based recording application fails to join the call.

    If this is set to False, call establishment will proceed normally if the policy-based recording application fails to join the call.

  defaultValue: "True"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequiredBeforeMeetingJoin
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the policy-based recording application must be in the meeting before the user is allowed to join the meeting.

    If this is set to True, the user will not be allowed to join the meeting if the policy-based recording application fails to join the meeting.
    The meeting will still continue for users who are in the meeting.

    If this is set to False, the user will be allowed to join the meeting even if the policy-based recording application fails to join the meeting.

  defaultValue: "True"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequiredDuringCall
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the policy-based recording application must be in the call while the call is active.

    If this is set to True, the call will be cancelled if the policy-based recording application leaves the call or is dropped from the call.

    If this is set to False, call establishment will proceed normally if the policy-based recording application leaves the call or is dropped from the call.

  defaultValue: "True"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequiredDuringMeeting
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the policy-based recording application must be in the meeting while the user is in the meeting.

    If this is set to True, the user will be ejected from the meeting if the policy-based recording application leaves the meeting or is dropped from the meeting.
    The meeting will still continue for users who are in the meeting.

    If this is set to False, the user will not be ejected from the meeting if the policy-based recording application leaves the meeting or is dropped from the meeting.

  defaultValue: "True"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Tenant
  description: |+
    Globally unique identifier (GUID) of the tenant account whose Teams recording policies are being queried.
    For example:

    -Tenant "38aad667-af54-4397-aaa7-e94c79ec2308"

    You can return your tenant ID by running this command:

    Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID

    If you are using a remote session of Windows PowerShell and are connected only to Skype for Business Online you do not have to include the Tenant parameter.
    Instead, the tenant ID will automatically be filled in for you based on your connection information.
    The Tenant parameter is primarily for use in a hybrid deployment.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf

description: |-
  Policy-based recording applications are used in automatic policy-based recording scenarios.
  When Microsoft Teams users participate in meetings or make or receive calls, the policy-based recording applications i.e. bots associated with the user's Teams recording policy are invited into the call or meeting to enforce compliance with the administrative set policy.

  Instances of these applications are created using CsOnlineApplicationInstance cmdlets and are then associated with Teams recording policies.

  Note that application instances of policy-based recording applications must be associated with a Teams recording policy using the CsTeamsComplianceRecordingApplication cmdlets.
  Once the association is done, the Identity of these application instances becomes \<Identity of the associated Teams recording policy\>/\<ObjectId of the application instance\>.
  For example, the Identity of an application instance can be \"Tag:ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy/39dc3ede-c80e-4f19-9153-417a65a1f144\", which indicates that the application instance with ObjectId 39dc3ede-c80e-4f19-9153-417a65a1f144 is associated with the Teams recording policy with Identity ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy.

  Please work with your Microsoft certified policy-based recording application provider to obtain an instance of their recording application.
  Please refer to the documentation of the CsOnlineApplicationInstance cmdlets for information on how to create an application instance of a policy-based recording application.
  Please also refer to the documentation of CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy cmdlets for further information.
