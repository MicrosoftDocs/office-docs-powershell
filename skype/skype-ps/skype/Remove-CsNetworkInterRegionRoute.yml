  code: |-
    Get-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute | Where-Object {$_.NetworkRegionID1 -eq "NorthAmerica" -or $_.NetworkRegionID2 -eq "NorthAmerica"} | Remove-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute
  description: |-
    Example 2 removes all region routes that include the NorthAmerica region.
    The first part of the command is a call to the `Get-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute` cmdlet.
    This cmdlet, called with no parameters, will retrieve all region routes.
    Next, this collection of routes is piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet.
    The `Where-Object` cmdlet will narrow the collection down to only those routes that have NorthAmerica defined as one of the regions in the route.
    It does this by checking to see if the route has a NetworkRegionID1 value equal to (-eq) NorthAmerica, or (-or) a NetworkRegionID2 value equal to NorthAmerica.
    Once the collection contains only the routes that include the NorthAmerica region, we pipe the collection to the `Remove-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute` cmdlet, which removes each of those routes.

name: Remove-CsNetworkInterRegionRoute
description: |-
  Every region within a CAC configuration must have some way to access every other region.
  While region links set bandwidth limitations on the connections between regions and also represent the physical links, a route determines which linked path the connection will traverse from one region to another.
  This cmdlet removes one of these route associations.
