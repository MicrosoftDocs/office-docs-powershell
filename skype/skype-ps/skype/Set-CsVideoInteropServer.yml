### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Use the `Set-CsVideoInteropServer` to modify the property values of one or more Video Interop Servers (VIS).
  The Video Interop Server is a Skype service that is used to communicate with a Video Gateway via a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk.
  Video Gateways route traffic between internal and 3rd party video devices such as an internal Skype endpoint exchanging video with a 3rd party PBX supporting 3rd party video teleconferencing systems (VTCs).
  The Video Gateway and a Video Interop Server (VIS) use a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk to connect video calls between 3rd party VTCs and internal endpoints.

  code: |-
    Set-CsVideoInteropServer -Identity "VideoInteropServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -SipTrunkTlsPort 444
  description: |-
    This example sets the SIP trunk TLS port for the Video Interop server VideoInteropServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com to port 444.

  code: |-
    Get-CsService -VideoInteropServer | Set-CsVideoInteropServer -SipTrunkTlsPort 444
  description: |-
    This example sets the SIP trunk TLS port for all the organization's Video Interop servers is set to port 444.
    This the command first calls the `Get-CsService` cmdlet, along with the VideoInteropServer parameter, to return a collection of all the Video Interop servers configured for use in the organization.
    That collection is then piped to the `Set-CsVideoInteropServer` cmdlet, which changes the TLS port for each server in the collection.

description: |-
  The Video Interop Server (VIS) in Skype for Business Server incorporates 3rd party video teleconferencing systems (VTCs) into your Skype for Business Server infrastructure.
  The VIS is a service that runs on a standalone pool and cannot be co-located on an FE pool.

  To enable the Video Interop Server, you must use Topology Builder to define at least one VIS instance.
  Each VIS instance will typically be associated with one or more Video Gateways.
  Video Gateways route traffic between internal and 3rd party video devices such as an internal Skype endpoint receiving video from a 3rd party PBX supporting 3rd party video teleconferencing systems (VTCs).
  The Video Gateway and a VIS use a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk to connect video calls between 3rd party VTCs and internal endpoints.

  After the Video Interop Server has been defined by using the Topology Builder, you can then modify the properties of that server by using the `Set-CsVideoInteropServer` cmdlet.

  To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt.

  `Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -Match "Set-CsVideoInteropServer"}`
