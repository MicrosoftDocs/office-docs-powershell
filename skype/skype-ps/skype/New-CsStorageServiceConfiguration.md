# New-CsStorageServiceConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Creates new instances of the Skype for Business Server Storage Service.
The storage service provides a common infrastructure that enables Skype for Business Server components to use Exchange as a backend data store.

## SYNTAX

```
New-CsStorageServiceConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Confirm] [-EnableAsyncAdaptorTaskAbort <Boolean>]
 [-EnableAutoImportFlushedData <Boolean>] [-EnableFabricReplicationSetReduction <Boolean>]
 [-FabricInvalidStateTimeoutDuration <UInt64>] [-Force] [-InMemory] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Skype for Business Server Storage Service enables Skype for Business Server components, such as archiving, to use Exchange as a back-end data store.
This helps to reduce operating costs: for example, you do not need to have separate storage solutions for Exchange archiving and for Skype for Business Server archiving.
The Storage Service also enables Skype for Business Server to leverage the heavy investment that has been made in Exchange archiving and storage; and prevents administrators from having to use multiple tools to retrieve archived data.

Separate instances of the Skype for Business Server Storage Service can be configured at the global, site and service scope (for the Registrar service only).
By default, Skype for Business Server provides you with a single, global collection of Storage Service configuration settings.
However, administrators have the option of creating custom settings by using the `New-CsStorageServiceConfiguration` cmdlet.
Those custom settings can later be deleted by using the `Remove-CsStorageServiceConfiguration` cmdlet.

Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the `New-CsStorageServiceConfiguration` cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
New-CsStorageServiceConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond"
```

The command shown in Example 1 creates a new collection of storage service configuration settings applied to the Redmond site.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

`-Identity "site:Redmond"`

To create settings at the service scope, use syntax similar to this:
