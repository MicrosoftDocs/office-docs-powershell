- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Grant-CsOUPermission -OU "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" -ObjectType "user"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 grants user management rights (-ObjectType "user") to the Redmond OU in the domain litwareinc.com.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Grant-CsOUPermission -OU "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" -ObjectType "user","contact","inetOrgPerson"
  description: |-
    In Example 2, management rights are granted for three different objects (user, contact, inetOrgPerson) for the Redmond OU in the domain litwareinc.com.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $x = "ou=Redmond,dc=litwareinc,dc=com", "ou=Dublin,dc=litwareinc,dc=com", "ou=Tokyo,dc=litwareinc,dc=com"

    foreach ($i in $x) {Grant-CsOUPermission -OU $i -ObjectType "user"}
  description: |-
    In Example 3, user management rights are simultaneously granted for three different OUs: Redmond, Dublin, and Tokyo.
    To carry out this task, the first command in the example creates an array variable named $x; this variable holds the distinguished names of the three Active Directory OUs where rights will be granted.
    In the second command, a foreach loop is created that takes each OU stored in the array and runs the Grant-CsOUPermission cmdlet against that organizational unit.
    In turn, that command grants user management rights for each OU in the array.

description: |-
  If you have locked down your Active Directory domain (that is, if you have disabled permission inheritance) then the domain preparation that takes place when you install Skype for Business Server will not be able to add the rights needed to manage users, computers, contacts, application contacts, and InetOrg persons.
  (Domain administrators will still be able to manage these objects, but no one else, including members of the RTCUniversalUserAdmins group, will have management rights.) In that case, you will need to use the Grant-CsOUPermission cmdlet to give the required security groups the required rights.
  This must be done on a container-by-container basis.

  Note that this cmdlet only grants rights to a set of predefined security groups; the cmdlet cannot be used to grant rights to arbitrary security groups or to individual users.

  Rights granted by using the Grant-CsOUPermission cmdlet can later be removed by using the Revoke-CsOUPermission cmdlet.
  If you run that cmdlet, then the groups initially granted the OU rights will no longer have those Skype for Business Server management rights for the specified Active Directory container.
  In that case, you will need to be an enterprise administrator or a domain administrator in order to manage Skype for Business Server or one of its components.
