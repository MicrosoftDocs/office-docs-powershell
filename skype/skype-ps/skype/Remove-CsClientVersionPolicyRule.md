# Remove-CsClientVersionPolicyRule

## SYNOPSIS
Removes one or more client version policy rules configured for use in your organization.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsClientVersionPolicyRule [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-Tenant <Guid>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Client version rules are used to determine which client applications are allowed to log on to Skype for Business Server.
When a user attempts to log on to Skype for Business Server, his or her client application sends a SIP header to the server; this header includes detailed information about the application itself, including the software's major version, minor version and build number.
The version information is then checked against a collection of client version rules to see if any rules apply to that particular application.
For example, suppose a user attempts to log on by using Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2.
Before the user can log on, the system will check to see if there is a client version rule that applies to Office Communicator 2007 R2.
If such a rule exists, Skype for Business Server will then take the action specified by the rule.
That action must be one of the following:

Allow.
The user will be allowed to log on.

AllowAndUpgrade.
The user will be allowed to log on and his or her copy of Communicator 2007 R2 will automatically be upgraded to the latest version of Lync.
Upgrades are carried out using either Microsoft Update or Windows Server Update Services, depending on how you have configured your system.

AllowWithUrl.
The user will be allowed to log on and a message will be displayed pointing the user to a URL where the latest version of Lync can be downloaded and installed.
The URL must point to a website that you have created yourself; no such site is created for you when you install Skype for Business Server.

Block.
The user will not be allowed to log on.

BlockAndUpgrade.
The user will not be allowed to log on, but his or her copy of Communicator 2007 R2 will automatically be upgraded to the latest version of Lync.
The user can then try to log on by using the new client application.
Upgrades are carried out using either Microsoft Update or Windows Server Update Services, depending on how you have configured your system.

BlockWithUrl.
The user will not be allowed to log on, but a message will be displayed pointing him or her to a URL where the latest version of Lync can be downloaded and installed.
The URL must point to a website that you have created yourself; no such site is created for you when you install Skype for Business Server.

Client version rules are collected in client version policies, which can be configured at the global scope, the site scope, the service scope (Registrar service), or the per-user scope.
The `Remove-CsClientVersionPolicyRule` cmdlet enables you to delete one or more of the client policy rules configured for use in your organization.
These rules can be deleted from any of your client version policies, including the global policy.

It's important to note that client version policies do not apply to federated users; instead, federated users are bound by the client version policies used in their own organization.
For example, suppose a federated user uses client A, a client allowed by the federated organization.
As long as the federated organization allows the use of client A, this user will be able to communicate with your organization using that client.
This will be true even if your client version policy blocks the use of client A.
Client version policies enforced in your organization do not override the client version policies used in a federated organization.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Remove-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Identity site:Redmond/74ba9211-8610-42f9-91ba-846cdee98820
```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes the client version policy rule that has the Identity site:Redmond/74ba9211-8610-42f9-91ba-846cdee98820.
Because Identities must be unique, this command will only delete, at most, a single rule.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule -Filter "site:Redmond/*" | Remove-CsClientVersionPolicyRule
```

Example 2 deletes all the client version policy rules that have been configured for the Redmond site.
To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule` cmdlet along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "site:Redmond/*" limits the returned data to policy rules that have an Identity that begins with the string value "site:Redmond/".
This filtered collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsClientVersionPolicyRule` cmdlet, which deletes each item in that collection.


### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------
```
Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule | Where-Object {$_.Enabled -eq $False} | Remove-CsClientVersionPolicyRule
```

Example 3 deletes all the client version policy rules that are currently disabled.
To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsClientVersionPolicyRule` cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the policy rules currently in use in the organization.
This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out all the rules where the Enabled property is equal to False.
The filtered collection is then piped to the `Remove-CsClientVersionPolicyRule` cmdlet, which deletes each item in that collection.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the client version policy rule to be removed.
The Identity of a client version rule consists of the scope where the rule has been configured plus a globally unique identifier (GUID).
That means that a rule will have an Identity similar to this: site:Redmond/1987d3c2-4544-489d-bbe3-59f79f530a83.

For example:

`-Tenant "38aad667-af54-4397-aaa7-e94c79ec2308"`

You can return the tenant ID for each of your Skype for Business Online tenants by running this command:

`Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID`

```yaml
Type: Guid
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019
