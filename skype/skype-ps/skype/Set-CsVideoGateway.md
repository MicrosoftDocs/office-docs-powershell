# Set-CsVideoGateway

## SYNOPSIS
Use the `Set-CsVideoGateway` cmdlet to modify the property values of one or more Video Gateways.
Video Gateways route traffic between internal and 3rd party video devices such as an internal Skype endpoint exchanging video with a 3rd party PBX supporting 3rd party video teleconferencing systems (VTCs).
The Video Gateway and a Video Interop Server (VIS) use a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk to connect video calls between 3rd party VTCs and internal endpoints.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-CsVideoGateway [[-Identity] <XdsGlobalRelativeIdentity>] [-Confirm] [-Force]
 [-VideoGatewaySipClientTcpPort <UInt16>] [-VideoGatewaySipClientTlsPort <UInt16>]
 [-VideoInteropServer <String>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Video Interop Server (VIS) in Skype for Business Server incorporates 3rd party video teleconferencing systems (VTCs) into your Skype for Business Server infrastructure.
The VIS is a service that runs on a standalone pool and cannot be co-located on an FE pool.

To enable the Video Interop Server, you must use Topology Builder to define at least one VIS instance.
Each VIS instance will typically be associated with one or more Video Gateways.
Video Gateways route traffic between internal and 3rd party video devices such as an internal Skype endpoint receiving video from a 3rd party PBX supporting 3rd party video teleconferencing systems (VTCs).
The Video Gateway and a Video Interop Server (VIS) use a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk to connect video calls between 3rd party VTCs and internal endpoints.
After a Video Gateway has been defined, you can then manage the properties of that gateway by using the `Set-CsVideoGateway` cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsVideoGateway -Identity "VideoGateway:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -VideoGatewaySipClientTcpPort 444
```

The command shown in Example 1 changes the TCP client port for the video gateway located on the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
In this example, the port is set to 444.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsService -VideoGateway | Set-CsVideoGateway -VideoGatewaySipClientTcpPort 444
```

In Example 2, the TCP client ports for all the video gateways deployed in the organization are set to 444.
To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsService` cmdlet and the -VideoGateway parameter to return a collection of all the video gateways, That collection is then piped to the `Set-CsVideoGateway` cmdlet, which sets the TCP client port for all the gateways in the collection to 444.
