# Remove-CsVoiceConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Resets the voice configuration to its default values.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsVoiceConfiguration [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Voice test configurations are used to test a phone number against a specific voice policy, route and dial plan.
This cmdlet removes the global (and only) voice configuration, which is a container for all voice test configurations defined for a Skype for Business Server deployment.
"Removing" the voice configuration doesn't actually remove it; the global instance is still there.
However, it does set the list of voice test configurations to the default, which is empty.

WARNING: Removing the voice configuration (which sets the list of voice test configurations to empty) deletes all defined voice test configurations for a Skype for Business Server deployment.
After calling this cmdlet, a call to the `Get-CsVoiceTestConfiguration` cmdlet will return no results.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Remove-CsVoiceConfiguration -Identity Global -Confirm
```

This example resets the Global (and only) voice configuration to the default values.
This action deletes all defined voice test configurations, so we added the Confirm parameter in order to receive a prompt asking whether we really want to perform this action before the removal takes place.
