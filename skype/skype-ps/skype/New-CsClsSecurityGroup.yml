  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AccessLevel
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    String value specifying the access level assigned to the group.
    Access levels are arbitrary string values assigned by administrators and used to categorize security groups.
    For example:

    `-AccessLevel "Tier3"`

    Multiple groups can share the same access level.
    Currently the only values that have meaning are "Tier3", "Tier2", "Product", "Ops", and "Pii".

  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Unique identifier for the new security group.
    Security group Identities consist of the centralized logging configuration scope where the group will be created plus a unique security group name.
    For example, to create a global security group named HelpDesk use this syntax:

    `-Identity "global/HelpDesk"`

    If you use the Identity parameter then you cannot use either the name parameter or the Parent parameter in that same command.

    Creates an object reference without actually committing the object as a permanent change.
    If you assign the output of this cmdlet called with this parameter to a variable, you can make changes to the properties of the object reference and then commit those changes by calling this cmdlet's matching Set- cmdlet.

    Unique name for the new security group.
    For example:

    `-Name "HelpDesk"`

    If you use the Name parameter you must also use the Parent parameter.
    However, you should not use the Identity parameter in the same command as the Name and Parent parameters.

  name: Parent
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Scope of the centralized logging configuration settings where the new security group will be located.
    For example, to add the new security group to the global settings, use this syntax:

    `-Parent "global"`

    You can return identities for all your centralizing logging "parents" by using this command:

    `Get-CsCentralizedLoggingConfiguration | Select-Object Identity`

    If you use the Name parameter you must also use the Parent parameter.
    However, you should not use the Identity parameter in the same command as the Name and Parent parameters.

  The centralized logging service (which replaces the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides a way for administrators to manage logging and tracing for all computers and pools running Skype for Business Server.
  Centralized logging enables administrators to stop, start, and configure logging for one or more pools and computers by using a single command; for example, you can use one command to enable Address Book service logging on all your Address Book servers.
  This differs from the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools, which had to be individually managed (including individually stopped and started) on each server.
  In addition, the centralized logging service also provides a way for administrators to search trace logs from the command, using the Windows PowerShell command-line interface and the Search-CsClsLogging cmdlet.

  With Skype for Business Online, security groups are used to determine which users have access to the personally-identifiable information that is written to the log files.
  Security groups are created by using the New-CsClsSecurityGroup cmdlet and then are added to a collection of centralized logging configuration settings.

  Skype for Business Server Control Panel: The functions carried out by the New-CsClsSecurityGroup cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
