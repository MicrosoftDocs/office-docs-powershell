examples:

  code: |-
    Remove-CsConferenceDirectory -Identity 2
  description: |-

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsConferenceDirectory | Where-Object {$_.ServiceID -match "UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} | Remove-CsConferenceDirectory
  description: |-
    Example 2 deletes all the conference directories found on the service UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsConferenceDirectory` cmdlet without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the conference directories currently in use in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those directories hosted on the service UserServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    In turn, that filtered collection is piped to and deleted by, the `Remove-CsConferenceDirectory` cmdlet.

description: |-
  When you create a dial-in conferencing Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) those URIs are assigned unique SIP addresses.
  However, SIP addresses are difficult to translate to devices that are not SIP-aware; for example, a public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephone can't translate a SIP address.
  Because of that, Skype for Business Server uses conference directories as a way to help these devices locate, and connect to, dial-in conferences.
  This is done by creating a SIP conference directory that is associated with each dial-in conferencing URI and is identified by an integer value rather than a SIP URI.
  PSTN telephones and other devices can then use these numbers (rather than a SIP URI) when connecting to conferences; the directory number is included in the PSTN conference identification users enter when connecting to a dial-in conference.

  Conference directories are created by using the `New-CsConferenceDirectory` cmdlet.
  Occasionally, you might need to delete one or more of these directories; for example, you might need to decommission the pool where the directories were hosted.
  Conference directories can be removed by calling the `Remove-CsConferenceDirectory` cmdlet.
  Note that if you need to move a directory from one pool to another, you can do so by calling the `Move-CsConferenceDirectory` cmdlet.
