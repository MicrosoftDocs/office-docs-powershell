# Set-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

The TeamsCallParkPolicy controls whether or not users are able to leverage the call park feature in Microsoft Teams.  Call park allows enterprise voice customers to place a call on hold and then perform a number of actions on that call: transfer to another department, retrieve via the same phone, or retrieve via a different Teams phone.  The Set-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy cmdlet lets you update a policy that has already been created for your organization.

NOTE: The call park feature currently available in desktop, mobile, and web clients. Supported with TeamsOnly mode.
