# Update-CsAddressBook

## SYNOPSIS
Forces the specified Address Book servers to synchronize their contents with the User database.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Update-CsAddressBook [[-Fqdn] <Fqdn>] [-Force] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Address Book servers are intermediaries between Active Directory and Skype for Business Server.
The Address Book server ensures that the user information stored in Skype for Business Server is in synch with the user information stored in Active Directory.
This is done by periodically synching Address Book files with the information stored in the User database.
By default, this synchronization takes place every five minutes.
(However, that time interval can be modified by using the `Set-CsAddressBookConfiguration` cmdlet.)

If you can't wait for synchronization to take place or if it appears that, for some reason, synchronization isn't taking place, you can use the `Update-CsAddressBook` cmdlet to force an Address Book server to immediately synch with the user information stored in the User database.



## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------
```
Update-CsAddressBook
```

In Example 1, the `Update-CsAddressBook` cmdlet is called without any parameters.
This synchronizes all the Address Book servers in the organization.


### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------
```
Update-CsAddressBook -Fqdn atl-abs-001.litwareinc.com
```

In Example 2, only a single Address Book server is synchronized: the server with the FQDN atl-abs-001.litwareinc.com.


## PARAMETERS

### -Fqdn
Enables you to specify an individual Address Book to be updated.
If this parameter is not included then all of your Address Book servers will be synchronized with the User database.
Individual Address Book servers should be referenced by their fully qualified domain name (FQDN); for example, atl-abs-001.litwareinc.com.
