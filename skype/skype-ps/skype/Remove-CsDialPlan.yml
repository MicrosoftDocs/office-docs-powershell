examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Remove-CsDialPlan -Identity RedmondDialPlan
  description: |-
    Example 1 uses the `Remove-CsDialPlan` cmdlet to delete the per-user dial plan with the Identity RedmondDialPlan.
    Note that when you delete a dial plan, you do not necessarily have to assign a new plan to users who were assigned the now-deleted plan.
    Instead, those users will use the dial plan assigned to their service or site, or the global plan.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsDialPlan | Where-Object {$_.Description -match "Redmond"} | Remove-CsDialPlan
  description: |-
    In Example 2 all the dial plans that include the word Redmond in their description are deleted.
    To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsDialPlan` cmdlet to return a collection of all the dial plans configured for use within the organization.
    That collection is then piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which applies a filter that limits the returned data to profiles that include the word Redmond in their description.
    After that's done, the filtered collection is passed to the `Remove-CsDialPlan` cmdlet, which removes all the dial plans in the collection.

description: |-
  This cmdlet removes an existing dial plan (also known as a location profile).
  Dial plans provide information required to enable Enterprise Voice users to make telephone calls.
  Dial plans are also used by the Conferencing Attendant application for dial-in conferencing.
  A dial plan determines such things as which normalization rules are applied and whether a prefix must be dialed for external calls.

  Note: Removing a dial plan will also remove any associated normalization rules.
  If the global dial plan is removed, any associated normalization rules will also be removed, but a default global normalization rule will be created.
