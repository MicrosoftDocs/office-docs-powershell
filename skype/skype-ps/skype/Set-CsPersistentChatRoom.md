## DESCRIPTION
The Persistent Chat service (which replaces the Group Chat service used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides organizations with messaging and collaboration capabilities similar to those found in Internet discussion forums: users can exchange messages in real-time, yet can also revisit and restart those conversations at any time.
Conversations can be based around specific topics, and these conversations can be made available to everyone or to only a selected set of users.
Likewise, individual chat rooms can be configured so that anyone can post a message or configured so that only designated presenters can post messages.

Persistent Chat discussions take the form of messages posted in individual chat rooms; chat rooms are discussion forums based on specific topics.
By design, messages posted in a chat room remain there forever; at any time, users can return to the room and review all the messages that have been previously posted.

The `Set-CsPersistentChatRoom` cmdlet enables you to modify any (or all) of the chat rooms that have been configured for use in your organization.
This includes assigning Managers and Presenters to a room.

Skype for Business Server Control Panel: To modify an existing Persistent Chat chat room using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click Persistent Chat, click Room, then double-click the chat room to be modified.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsPersistentChatRoom -Identity "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com\ITChatRoom" -Disabled $True
```

The command shown in Example 1 disables the Persistent Chat chat room with the Identity atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com\ITChatRoom.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsPersistentChatRoom -PersistentChatPoolFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" | Set-CsPersistentChatRoom -Disabled $True
```

In Example 2, all the Persistent Chat chat rooms on the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com are disabled`.
This task is performed by first using the `Get-CsPersistentChatRoom` cmdlet and the Identity parameter to return all the chat rooms configured for the pool `atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com`.
These chat rooms are then piped to the `Set-CsPersistentChatRoom` cmdlet, which sets the Disabled property of each room to True ($True).


### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsPersistentChatRoom | Set-CsPersistentChatRoom -Disabled $True
```

Example 3 disables all the Persistent Chat chat rooms in the organization.
To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsPersistentChatRoom` cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the Persistent Chat chat rooms.
This collection is then piped to the `Set-CsPersistentChatRoom` cmdlet, which disables each room in the collection.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique Identifier for the Persistent Chat chat room being modified.
The Identity for a chat room consists of the Persistent Chat pool where the room has been configured plus the name of the room; for example:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Invitations
Specifies whether or not invitations for the chat room will be inherited from the category.
Among other things, this means that users on the Members list will automatically receive an invitation to join a new chat room at the time that new room is created.
If set to False, invitations will not be used for the room.
If set to Inherit, the room will use the Invitations setting specified for its Category.

```yaml
Type: ChatRoomInvitations

Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

```

### -Managers
List of users allowed to define the membership of the chat room as well as configure other settings for the room.

To add a new user to the Managers list, use syntax similar to this:

`-Managers @{Add="sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"}`

Multiple users can be added by separating the user SIP addresses with commas:

`-Managers @{Add="sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com", "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com"}`

To remove a user from the Managers list use the Remove method:

`-Managers @{Remove="sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"}`

To remove all the users from the Managers list, set the value of the Managers property to null:

`-Managers $Null`

In addition to working with individual users you can also work with entire OUs.
For example, this command adds all the users in the IT OU to the managers list:

`-Managers @{Add="OU=IT,DC=litwareinc,DC=com"}`

To make all the users in a distribution list chat room managers, use the Active Directory distinguished name of that distribution list:

`-Managers @{Add="CN=ChatSupportGroup,OU=IT,DC=litwareinc,DC=com"}`

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSListModifier`1[System.String]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Members
List of users who are allowed to access the chat room.
If the Members property is null then the chat room inherits the membership list from its Persistent Chat category.

To add a new user to the Members list, use syntax similar to this:

`-Members @{Add="sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"}`

Multiple users can be added by separating the user SIP addresses with commas:

`-Members @{Add="sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com", "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com"}`

To remove a user from the Members list use the Remove method:

`-Members @{Remove="sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"}`

To remove all the users from the Members list, set the value of the Members property to null:

`-Members $Null`

In addition to working with individual users you can also work with entire OUs.
For example, this command adds all the users in the IT OU to the Members list:

`-Members @{Add="OU=IT,DC=litwareinc,DC=com"}`

To make all the users in a distribution list chat room members, use the Active Directory distinguished name of that distribution list:

`-Members @{Add="CN=ChatSupportGroup,OU=IT,DC=litwareinc,DC=com"}`

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSListModifier`1[System.String]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None

```

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Presenters
List of users who are allowed to post messages in an auditorium chat room.

To add a new user to the Presenters list, use syntax similar to this:

`-Presenters @{Add="sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"}`

Multiple users can be added by separating the user SIP addresses with commas:

`-Presenters @{Add="sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com", "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com"}`

To remove a user from the Presenters list use the Remove method:

`-Presenters @{Remove="sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"}`

To remove all the users from the Presenters list, set the value of the Presenters property to null:

`-Presenters $Null`

In addition to working with individual users you can also work with entire OUs.
For example, this command adds all the users in the IT OU to the Presenters list:

`-Presenters @{Add="OU=IT,DC=litwareinc,DC=com"}`

To make all the users in a distribution list chat room presenters, use the Active Directory distinguished name of that distribution list:

`-Presenters @{Add="CN=ChatSupportGroup,OU=IT,DC=litwareinc,DC=com"}`

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSListModifier`1[System.String]
