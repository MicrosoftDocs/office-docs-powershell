# Get-CsRgsQueue

## SYNOPSIS
Retrieves information about the Response Group queues in use in your organization.
With the Response Group application, phone calls are put in a queue and calls are placed on hold until a Response Group agent is available to answer that call.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Get-CsRgsQueue [[-Identity] <RgsIdentity>] [-Name <String>] [-Owner <RgsIdentity>] [-ShowAll]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
When someone calls a phone number associated with the Response Group application, one of two things typically happens: either the call is transferred to a question that the caller must answer in order to continue (for example, "Press 1 for hardware support; press 2 for software support") or the call is placed in a queue until a Response Group agent is available to answer the call.

Instead of having a single queue for all phone calls, the Response Group application enables you to create multiple queues that can be associated with different workflows and different Response Group agent groups.
In turn, this means queues can respond differently to events such as a designated number of calls being simultaneously held in the queue, or to callers that have been on hold for a specified number of seconds.

The Get-CsRgsQueue cmdlet provides a way for you to return information about the Response Group queues configured for use in your organization.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-CsRgsQueue
```

The command shown in Example 1 returns information about all the Response Group queues configured for use in the organization.
This is done by calling Get-CsRgsQueue without any parameters.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsRgsQueue -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com
```

The command shown in Example 2 returns information about all the Response Group queues located on the service ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsRgsQueue -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com -Name "Help Desk"
```

In Example 3, information is returned for a single Response Group queue: the queue named "Help Desk" located on the service ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```
Get-CsRgsQueue -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com | Select-Object -ExpandProperty TimeoutAction
```

The command shown in Example 4 displays detailed information about the TimeoutAction property for each Response Group queue found on the service ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
To carry out this task, Get-CsRgsQueue is first used to return information about all the queues found on ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
This information is then passed to the Select-Object cmdlet, which "expands" the value stored in the TimeoutAction property.
When you expand the TimeoutAction property, you see the individual properties of the embedded object that make up the property value: Prompt; TargetQuestion; Target; TargetQueueID; and TargetUri.

### -------------------------- Example 5 --------------------------
```
Get-CsRgsQueue -Identity service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com | Where-Object {$_.OverflowCandidate -eq "NewestCall"}
```

Example 5 returns information about all the Response Group queues on ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com where the OverflowCandidate property is set to NewestCall.
To accomplish this task, the command first uses Get-CsRgsQueue to return a collection of all the Response Group queues found on the specified service.
That collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those queues where the OverflowCandidate property is equal to "NewestCall".



## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Represents either the Identity of the service where the Response Group queue is hosted or the full Identity of the queue itself.
If you specify the service Identity (for example, service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com), then all the Response Group queues hosted on that service will be returned.
If you specify the Identity of the queue, then only the specified Response Group queue will be returned.
Note that the Identity of a queue consists of the service Identity followed by a globally unique identifier (GUID); for example: service:ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com /1987d3c2-4544-489d-bbe3-59f79f530a83.

An alternate way to return a single Response Group queue is to specify the service Identity, then include the Name parameter and the queue name.
That enables you to retrieve a specific Response Group queue without having to know the GUID assigned to that queue.

If called without any parameters, Get-CsRgsQueue returns all the Response Group queues configured for use in your organization.

```yaml
Type: RgsIdentity
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Unique name given to the Response Group queue at the time the queue was created.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Owner
Fully qualified domain name of the pool that "owns" the queue.
The Owner pool ID and the Pool ID of a queue are typically the same.
However, if a queue needs to temporarily be moved (perhaps in a disaster recovery procedure) then the Pool ID will change.
However, the Owner ID will continue to point to the original pool.

```yaml
Type: RgsIdentity
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ShowAll
When present, shows all the Response Group queues, including those queues where the Owner pool ID and the Pool ID are different.
By default, Get-CsRgsQueue only returns information about queues where the Owner pool ID and the Pool ID are identical.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
