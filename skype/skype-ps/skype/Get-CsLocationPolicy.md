# Get-CsLocationPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Returns information about how (or if) the Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) Location Information service has been configured.
The E9-1-1 service enables those who answer emergency calls to determine the caller's geographic location.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

### Identity
```
Get-CsLocationPolicy [[-Identity] <XdsIdentity>] [-LocalStore] [-Tenant <Guid>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Filter
```
Get-CsLocationPolicy [-Filter <String>] [-LocalStore] [-Tenant <Guid>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The location policy is used to apply settings that relate to E9-1-1 functionality.
The location policy determines whether a user is enabled for E9-1-1, and if so what the behavior is of an emergency call.
For example, you can use the location policy to define what number constitutes an emergency call (911 in the United States), whether corporate security should be automatically notified, how the call should be routed, and so on.
This cmdlet retrieves one or more location policies.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-CsLocationPolicy
```

Example 1 returns a collection of all the location policies currently in use in your organization.
This is done simply by calling the Get-CsLocationPolicy cmdlet without any parameters.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Get-CsLocationPolicy -Identity Reno
```

The command shown in Example 2 returns only those location policies that have an Identity equal to Reno.
Because identities must be unique, this command will only return, at most, one location policy.

### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsLocationPolicy -Filter tag:*
```

Example 3 uses the Filter parameter to return all the location policies that have been configured at the per-use scope.
(Policies configured at the per-user scope can be directly assigned to users and network sites.) The wildcard string tag:* tells the Get-CsLocationPolicy cmdlet that the returned data should be limited to those location policies that have an Identity that begins with the string value tag:.
Even though you don't need to specify the tag: prefix when retrieving an individual policy, you can use that prefix to filter on all per-user policies.

### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```
Get-CsLocationPolicy | Where-Object {$_.EnhancedEmergencyServicesEnabled -eq $False}
```

Example 4 returns a collection of all the location policies where enhanced emergency services are disabled.
To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsLocationPolicy cmdlet to return a collection of all the location policies currently in use in the organization.
That collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet; in turn, the Where-Object cmdlet applies a filter that limits the returned data to those policies where the EnhancedEmergencyServicesEnabled property is equal to (-eq) False ($False).


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The unique identifier of the location policy you want to retrieve.
To retrieve the global location policy, use a value of Global.
For a policy created at the site scope, this value will be in the form site:\<site name\>, where site name is the name of a site defined in the Skype for Business Server deployment (for example, site:Redmond).
For a policy created at the per-user scope, this value will simply be the name of the policy, such as Reno.

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

```

### -Filter
A string containing wildcard characters that will retrieve location policies based on matching the Identity value of the policy to the wildcard string.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: Filter
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False

```

### -LocalStore
Retrieves the location policy information from the local replica of the Central Management store, rather than the Central Management store itself.

```yaml

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False

```

### -Tenant
Globally unique identifier (GUID) of the Skype for Business Online tenant account whose location policies are being returned.
For example:

`-Tenant "38aad667-af54-4397-aaa7-e94c79ec2308"`

You can return the tenant ID for each of your Skype for Business Online tenants by running this command:

`Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID`

```yaml
Type: Guid
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
