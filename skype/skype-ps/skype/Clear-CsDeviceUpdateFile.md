# Clear-CsDeviceUpdateFile

## SYNOPSIS
Deletes any rejected device update files that are no longer associated with a device.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Clear-CsDeviceUpdateFile [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Each time new device updates are uploaded to the system, a corresponding device update rule is created.
By default, these new device update rules are assigned to the Pending state; that means that the rules can be downloaded and installed on test devices, but not on production devices.
In turn, this gives you an opportunity to test the updates before making them available to users.
If testing is successful, you can then run the `Approve-CsDeviceUpdateRule` cmdlet to make these device updates available to users.

If testing is not successful then you can use the `Reset-CsDeviceUpdateRule` cmdlet or the `Restore-CsDeviceUpdateRule` cmdlet to reject an update.
When these cmdlets are run, the device update is disassociated from its device update rule.
At that point, administrators can then use the `Clear-CsDeviceUpdateFile` cmdlet to remove the disassociated updates from the server.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the `Clear-CsDeviceUpdateFile` cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Clear-CsDeviceUpdateFile"}


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Clear-CsDeviceUpdateFile -Identity "service:WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

The command shown in Example 1 deletes all the device update files from the service WebServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com that are no longer associated with a device.


## PARAMETERS
