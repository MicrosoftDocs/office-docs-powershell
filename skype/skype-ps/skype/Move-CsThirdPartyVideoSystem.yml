    The command shown in Example 1 moves the third-party video system with the Identity CN={ce84964a-c4da-4622-ad34-c54ff3ed361f},OU=Redmond,DC=Litwareinc,DC=com CN={ce84964a-c4da-4622-ad34-c54ff3ed361f},OU=Redmond,DC=Litwareinc,DC=com to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem | Move-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem -Target "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
  description: |-
    Example 2 shows how you can move all the third-party video systems in the organization to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
    To do this, the command first uses the Get-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem cmdlet to return a collection of all the available video systems.
    That collection is then piped to the Move-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem cmdlet, which moves all the video systems to the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.

description: |-
  Third-party video systems are VTC devices that provide remote users with telepresence capabilities (most notably audio and video).
  In Skype for Business Server, third-party VTC devices can be configured as Active Directory contact objects, much in the same way that analog phones and common area phones can be configured as contact objects.
  Associating each VTC device with a contact object makes it easy for administrators to track, and to manage, these devices.
  VTC contact objects can be created by using the New-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem cmdlet.
  Note that new contact objects must be assigned to a Skype for Business Server Registrar at the time they are created.
  If you later decide to move a contact object to a different pool, you can do so by using the Move-CsThirdPartyVideoSystem cmdlet.
