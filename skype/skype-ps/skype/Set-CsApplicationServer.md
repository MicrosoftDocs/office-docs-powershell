# Set-CsApplicationServer

## SYNOPSIS
Enables you to modify configuration properties of one or more servers running the Application service.
These servers (also known as Application Servers) host software programs, such as the Call Park application, that were developed using the Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA) set.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

## DESCRIPTION
The Application service hosts a number of Skype for Business Server programs that are not part of the core server components; these programs include the Response Group application, the Conferencing Attendant application and the Conferencing Announcement application.
The Application service takes these programs and fully integrates them into the Skype for Business Server environment.

The `Set-CsApplicationServer` cmdlet enables administrators to modify the configuration settings for any (or all) of the Application Servers deployed in their organization.
For example, you can modify the ports used for audio, video, or application sharing traffic, or assign new values to ports used by individual applications such as the Conferencing Attendant application or the Conferencing Announcement application.
Note that any time you change ports you will then need to restart the corresponding service.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------
```
Set-CsApplicationServer -Identity "ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -CasSipPort 5074
```

The command shown in Example 1 configures the SIP port for the Conferencing Announcement application on the Application Server ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com to 5074.


### -------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------
```
Set-CsApplicationServer -Identity "ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -AudioPortStart 49500 -AudioPortCount 5500
```

Example 2 configures audio ports for the Application Server ApplicationServer:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
In this example, the starting audio port is set to 49500 and a total of 5500 ports are set aside for audio traffic.


### -------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------
```
Get-CsService -ApplicationServer | ForEach-Object {Set-CsApplicationServer -Identity $_.Identity -CasSipPort 5074}
```

In Example 3, the SIP port for the Conferencing Announcement application is set to 5074 for all of the Application Servers in the organization.
To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsService` cmdlet to return a collection of all the Application Servers currently in use.
This collection is then piped to the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet, which takes each server in the collection and uses the `Set-CsApplicationServer` cmdlet to set the Conferencing Announcement application SIP port to 5074.
