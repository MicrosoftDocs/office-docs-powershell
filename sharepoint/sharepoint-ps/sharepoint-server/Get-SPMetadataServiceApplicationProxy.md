## EXAMPLES

### ----------------EXAMPLE------------- 
```
Get-SPMetadataServiceApplicationProxy -Identity "MetadataServiceProxy1"
```

This example retrieves an existing connection to a managed metadata service application.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the service application proxy to read.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of the service application proxy (for example, ServiceAppProxy1); or an instance of a valid SPMetadataServiceProxy object.

```yaml
Type: SPMetadataServiceProxyCmdletPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019
