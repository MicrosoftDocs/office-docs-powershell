# Set-SPFarmConfig

## SYNOPSIS
Sets a global property or a collection of global properties for the local farm.


## SYNTAX

```
Set-SPFarmConfig [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Confirm]
 [-DataFormWebPartAutoRefreshEnabled <Boolean>] [-Force] [-InstalledProductsRefresh]
 [-ServiceConnectionPointBindingInformation <String>] [-ServiceConnectionPointDelete] [-WhatIf]
 [-WorkflowBatchSize <Int32>] [-WorkflowEventDeliveryTimeout <Int32>] [-WorkflowPostponeThreshold <Int32>]
 [-ASPScriptOptimizationEnabled <Boolean>] [-UserAccountDirectoryPathIsImmutable]
 [-DefaultActivateOnSiteMasterValue <Boolean>] [-MaxSiteSubscriptionSettingsValueLength <UInt32>]
 [-MaxTenantStoreValueLength <UInt32>] [-SiteMasterMode <SPSiteMasterMode>]
 [-SiteMasterValidationIntervalInHours <UInt32>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Set-SPFarmConfig` cmdlet updates a collection of global settings for the local farm that are not members of the SPFarm object.
Use the `Get-SPFarmConfig` cmdlet to read global settings for the local farm and to create a new PSCustomObject object from the collection of properties returned from the local farm and then add this object to the pipeline.
Modify the PSCustomObject object and pass it to the `Set-SPFarmConfig` cmdlet to change the parameter values.

The properties collected in the PSCustomObject object must be farm-wide settings and must be configurable only once for the entire farm.
The parameter name added to the PSCustomObject object must match exactly the input parameter name for the `Set-SPFarmConfig` cmdlet.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### ---------------------EXAMPLE--------------------------
```
Set-SPFarmConfig -WorkflowBatchSize 50
```

This example sets the WorkflowBatdhSize to 50.

## PARAMETERS

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
