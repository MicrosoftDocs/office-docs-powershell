## DESCRIPTION
The `New-SPPerformancePointServiceApplicationProxy` cmdlet creates a proxy for a PerformancePoint Service application.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### --------------------EXAMPLE--------------------
```
New-SPPerformancePointServiceApplicationProxy -Name PPS_Application_Proxy_01 -ServiceApplication PPS_Application_01 -Default
```

This example creates a new PerformancePoint Service application proxy named PPS_Application_Proxy_01, associated with the service application named PPS_Application_01 and is added to the Default proxy group.


## PARAMETERS

### -Name
Specifies the name of the PerformancePoint Service application proxy to create.

The type must be a valid name of a PerformancePoint Service application proxy; for example, PerfPointAppProxy1.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ServiceApplication
Specifies the PerformancePoint Service application that is associated with the new service application proxy.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of a PerformancePoint service application (for example, PerfPointApp1); or an instance of a valid SPPerformancePointMonitoringServiceApplication object.

```yaml
Type: SPPerformancePointMonitoringServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
