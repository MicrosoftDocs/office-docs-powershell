# Add-SPSolution

## SYNOPSIS

Uploads a SharePoint solution package to the farm.

## SYNTAX

```
Add-SPSolution [-LiteralPath] <String> [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Confirm]
 [-Language <UInt32>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Add-SPSolution cmdlet adds a SharePoint solution package to the farm.
This cmdlet does not deploy the uploaded SharePoint solution.
Use the Install-SPSolution cmdlet to deploy the SharePoint solution in the farm.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).

## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------ 
```
Add-SPSolution -LiteralPath c:\contoso_solution.wsp
```

This example adds the SharePoint solution in the file contoso_solution.wsp to the farm.

## PARAMETERS

### -LiteralPath
Specifies the path to the solution package.

The type must be a valid path in either of the following forms:

- C:\folder_name
- \\\\server_name\folder_name

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019
