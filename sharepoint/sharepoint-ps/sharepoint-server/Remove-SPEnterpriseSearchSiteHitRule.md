## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE-------------------
```
Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchSiteHitRule -Identity myHost
```

This example removes a site hit rule for the myHost host.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The rule that is used for the specified site.

The type must be a valid site hit rule host or an instance of a valid SiteHitRule object.

```yaml
Type: SiteHitRulePipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SearchService
Specifies the search service in the farm that hosts the crawl.

The type must be an instance of a valid SearchService object; otherwise, the local service on the server that hosts the Windows PowerShell cmdlet is used.

```yaml
