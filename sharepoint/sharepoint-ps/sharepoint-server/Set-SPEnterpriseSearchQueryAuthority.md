# Set-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryAuthority

## SYNOPSIS
Sets the properties of an authoritative page for a shared search application.

## SYNTAX

```

 [-SearchApplication <SearchServiceApplicationPipeBind>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Set-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryAuthority` cmdlet updates properties of an authoritative page and adjusts the query rank of an authoritative page.
SPEnterpriseSearchQueryAuthority represents authoritative sites that rank higher in relevance than demoted sites, which are de-emphasized in relevance.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
Set-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryAuthority -Identity https://contoso.com -Level 0.5 -SearchApplication MySSA
```

This example adjusts the authoritative level of the URL https://contoso.com to 0.5 on the search service application named MySSA.


## PARAMETERS

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

### -Level
