### -Level

A search service application can have multiple authoritative pages.
The Level property is used to specify the relative relevance adjustment of the authoritative pages.
This parameter may receive a floating point value of 0.0 - 2.0, where 0.0 has the most positive impact on relevance.

```yaml
Type: Single
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: l
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Owner
Specifies the search object owner that defines the scope at which the corresponding Query Authority is created. The owner must be one of the following valid levels:- Search Service Application- Site Subscription

```yaml

Aliases: o
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SearchApplication
Specifies the search application that contains the authority page collection.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid search application name (for example, SearchApp1); or an instance of a valid SearchServiceApplication object.

Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)

```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
