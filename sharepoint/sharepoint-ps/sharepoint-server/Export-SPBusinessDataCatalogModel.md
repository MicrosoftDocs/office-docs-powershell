# Export-SPBusinessDataCatalogModel

## SYNOPSIS

Exports a Business Data Connectivity Model.



## SYNTAX

```
Export-SPBusinessDataCatalogModel -Identity <MetadataObject> -Path <String>
 [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Force] [-LocalizedNamesIncluded] [-ModelsIncluded]
 [-PermissionsIncluded] [-PropertiesIncluded] [-ProxiesIncluded] [-SettingId <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Export-SPBusinessDataCatalogModel cmdlet exports a Business Data Connectivity Model. 
There are two types of Business Data Connectivity models: Model type (.bdcm) and Resource type (.bdcr).
The Model type contains the base XML metadata, and can also include resource properties.
The Resource type includes only resource properties.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).

## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------ 
```
C:\PS>$Model = Get-SPBusinessDataCatalogMetadataObject -BdcObjectType "Model" -Name "ContosoModel" -ServiceContext http://contoso
Export-SPBusinessDataCatalogModel -Identity $Model -Path "C:\folder\model.bdcm"
```

This example gets a Business Data Connectivity Model from the Business Data Connectivity Metadata Store and exports it to the location specified with the name model and using the bdcm file extension.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the Business Data Connectivity Metadata Store metadata object from which to export the Business Data Connectivity Model.

```yaml
Type: MetadataObject
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path
Specifies the path and name to use to create the export file.

The type must be a valid path in either of the following forms:

- C:\folder_name \file.bdcm
- \\\\server_name\folder_name \file.bdcm
- ...\folder_name\file.bdcm

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
