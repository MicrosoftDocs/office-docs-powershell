## SYNOPSIS
Returns a content deployment path or a collection of content deployment paths.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-SPContentDeploymentPath [[-Identity] <SPContentDeploymentPathPipeBind>]

```

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-SPContentDeploymentPath cmdlet reads the specified content deployment path.
If the Identity parameter is not specified, this cmdlet returns the collection of content deployment paths on the farm.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).

## EXAMPLES

### --------------EXAMPLE-------------- 
```
Get-SPContentDeploymentPath -Identity 'Path 1'
```

This example returns the content deployment path named Path 1.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the content deployment path to get.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of a content deployment path (for example, DeployPath1); or an instance of a valid SPContentDeploymentJob object.

```yaml
Type: SPContentDeploymentPathPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019
