# Update-SPDistributedCacheSize

## SYNOPSIS
Reconfigures the allocation of memory that is dedicated to the Distributed Cache service.

## SYNTAX

```
Update-SPDistributedCacheSize [-CacheSizeInMB] <UInt32> [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Use the Update-SPDistributedCacheSize cmdlet to allocate memory to the Distributed cache service.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------EXAMPLE----------
```
Update-SPDistributedCacheSize -CacheSizeInMB 2048
```

Updates the Distributed Cache size to 2048MB.


## PARAMETERS

### -CacheSizeInMB
Specifies the memory size in megabytes (MB) that you want to allocate to the Distributed Cache service. The default value is 5 percent of total system random access memory (RAM). This value should not be more than 40 percent of total system RAM with a maximum limit of 16 gigabytes (GB).


```yaml
Type: UInt32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

NOTE: When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
