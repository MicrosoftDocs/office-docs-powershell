# Set-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlLogReadPermission

## SYNOPSIS
Grants users permission to view the crawl log information.


## SYNTAX

```
Set-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlLogReadPermission [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Confirm]
 [-Identity <CrawlLogReadPermissionPipeBind>] [-SearchApplication <SearchServiceApplicationPipeBind>]
 [-Tenant <Guid>] [-UserNames <String>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Only the Search Service Application administrator can use this cmdlet.

The administrator uses the `Set-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlLogReadPermission` cmdlet to grant users permission to view crawl log information.
The administrator can choose to restrict the permission to crawl log information from a particular tenant.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### --------------------EXAMPLE---------------------
```
$ssa = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication
$crawlLogPermission = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlLogReadPermission -SearchApplication $ssa -Tenant  "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
Set-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlLogReadPermission -Identity $crawlLogPermission -SearchApplication $ssa -UserNames "user1;user2" -Tenant "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
```

This example first defines $crawlLogPermission, which is the list of users who have permission to view the crawl log information from the tenant with id "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" on the search application referenced by $ssa.
Then the example uses the `Set-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlLogReadPermission` cmdlet to add user1 and user2 to the list of users referenced by $crawlLogPermission.


## PARAMETERS

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
