# Set-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryScope

## SYNOPSIS
Sets the properties of a query results scope for a shared search application.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryScope -AlternateResultsPage <String>
 [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-CompilationType <Int32>] [-Confirm] [-Description <String>]
 [-DisplayInAdminUI <Boolean>] -Identity <ScopePipeBind> [-Name <String>]
 [-SearchApplication <SearchServiceApplicationPipeBind>] [-Url <Uri>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
After you upgrade a Search service application to SharePoint Server, you can view shared scopes, but you cannot create, update, or delete them.
Therefore, you cannot use this cmdlet for shared scopes after upgrade.
However, you can convert shared scopes to result sources, which serve a similar purpose.
Similarly, after you upgrade to SharePoint Server Site Collection to SharePoint Server mode, you can view local scopes, but you cannot create, update, or delete them.
Therefore, you cannot use this cmdlet for local scopes after you upgrade a site collection.
However, you can convert local scopes to result sources, which serve a similar purpose.

The `Set-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryScope` cmdlet updates properties of a shared scope.
SPEnterpriseSearchQueryScope represents a query results scope used by all shared search applications on the farm.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
$ssa = Get-SPenterpriseSearchServiceApplication
Get-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryScope -Identity MustCrawl -SearchApplication $ssa | Set-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryScope -Description "Business critical sites to index" -CompilationType 1 -AlternateResultsPage https://altServer
```

This example obtains a reference to the scope named MustCrawl on the search service application named MySSA and changes the description, compilation type and alternate access URL.


## PARAMETERS

### -AlternateResultsPage
Specifies the location to display results for the new query scope.

The type must be a valid URL, in the form https://server_name.


```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: u
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.


```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named

Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CompilationType
Specifies the compilation type of the new scope.
