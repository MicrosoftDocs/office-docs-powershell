## DESCRIPTION
The `Set-SPAccessServiceApplication` cmdlet sets the global runtime properties of an existing Access Services application in SharePoint Server.
The changes made to the properties by using this cmdlet affect all machines in the farm on which this Access Services application runs.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------EXAMPLE 1------------------
```
Set-SPAccessServiceApplication -identity "MyAccessService" -RequestDurationMax 100
```

This example sets the Access Services application named MyAccessService to let requests take up to 100 seconds before they time out.


### ------------EXAMPLE 2------------------
```
Get-SPAccessServiceApplication | Set-SPAccessServiceApplication -SessionsPerUserMax 5
```

This example sets every Access Services application in the farm to allow up to five sessions per user on each back-end application server computer on which Access Services runs.

First, every Access Services application is retrieved and then a new value is set by using the `Set-SPAccessServiceApplication` cmdlet.


### ------------EXAMPLE 3------------------
```
Get-SPAccessServiceApplication | where {$_.RowsMax -gt 50000 } | Set-SPAccessServiceApplication -RowsMax 50000
```

This example sets every Access Services application in the farm that allows more than 50,000 rows to be returned from, or used in, a query and then sets the service application to allow up to 50,000 rows only.

First, every Access Services application that has more than 50,000 rows is retrieved and then a new value is set by using the `Set-SPAccessServiceApplication` cmdlet.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the Access Services application to update.

The type must be a valid name of an Access Services application; for example, AccessSrvApp1; a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; or an instance of a valid SPAccessServiceApplication object.

```yaml
Type: SPAccessServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
