## SYNTAX

 [-Filter <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Receive-SPServiceApplicationConnectionInfo` cmdlet retrieves the list of service applications published by another farm.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE-----------------------
```
Receive-SPServiceApplicationConnectionInfo -FarmUrl https://FarmB/topology/topology.svc
```

This example retreives a list of service applications published by a given farm.

The FarmURL parameter can be obtained by the `Get-SPTopologyServiceApplication` cmdlet.


## PARAMETERS

### -FarmUrl
Specifies the URL of the farm from which to receive service application information.

The type must be a valid URL, in the form https://site_name.

```yaml
Type: Uri
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
