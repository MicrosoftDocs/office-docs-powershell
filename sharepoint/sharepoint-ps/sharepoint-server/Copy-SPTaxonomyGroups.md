# Copy-SPTaxonomyGroups

## SYNOPSIS
Copies Managed Metadata Taxonomy Groups from SharePoint on-premises to SharePoint Online.

## SYNTAX

```
Copy-SPTaxonomyGroups [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-AuthEndpoint <String>]
 -Credential <PSCredential> [-GraphApiEndpoint <String>] -GroupNames <String[]> -LocalSiteUrl <Uri>
 -LocalTermStoreName <String> -RemoteSiteUrl <Uri> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Use the Copy-SPTaxonomyGroups cmdlet to copy specified Metadata groups from an on-premises environment to SharePoint Online in a Hybrid SharePoint setup. SharePoint Online becomes the authoritative source for the copied Taxonomy Group. All updates to the Taxonomy Group must be made in SharePoint Online.  Once a Taxonomy Group is copied, it cannot be re-copied.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1 
```
$credential = Get-Credential
Copy-SPTaxonomyGroups -LocalTermStoreName "Managed Metadata Service Application Proxy" -LocalSiteUrl "https://sharepoint" -RemoteSiteUrl "https://contoso.sharepoint.com" -GroupNames "Group1","Group2" -Credential $credential
```

This example copies two taxonomy groups "Group1" and "Group2" from local Term Store to the remote Term Store in "https://contoso.com". These two sites have been enabled with Hybrid Taxonomy.

## PARAMETERS

### -AssignmentCollection

Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
