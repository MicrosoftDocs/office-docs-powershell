## DESCRIPTION
The `Set-SPWordConversionServiceApplication` cmdlet sets global properties of a Word Automation Services application.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### -----------EXAMPLE-----------------
```
Get-SPServiceApplication -Name WordServices1 | Set-SPWordConversionServiceApplication -TimerJobFrequency 30
```

This example sets the timer job frequency of the WordServices1 application to 30 minutes.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the Word Automation Services application to update.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of a Word Automation Services application (for example, WordSvcApp1); or an instance of a valid SPServiceApplication object.

```yaml
Type: WordServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ActiveProcesses
Specifies the number of conversion processes on each machine on which the service application runs.
This value is equivalent to the number of simultaneous conversions.
The default value is 8.

The type must be a valid integer in the range from 1 to 1000.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AddSupportedFormats
Specifies a set of file formats to be enabled for use by the service application.

The value must be a comma-delimited list of one or more of the following: docx, doc, mht, rtf, xml.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ApplicationPool
Specifies the existing IIS managed application pool in which this instance of Word Automation Services runs.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of an application pool (for example, AppPoolName1); or an instance of a valid IISWebServiceApplicationPool object.

```yaml
Type: SPIisWebServiceApplicationPoolPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False

Accept wildcard characters: False
```
