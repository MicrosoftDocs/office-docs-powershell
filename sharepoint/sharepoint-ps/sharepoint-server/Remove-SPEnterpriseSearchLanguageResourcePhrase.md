## SYNTAX

```
Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchLanguageResourcePhrase [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Confirm]
 -Identity <LanguageResourcePhrasePipeBind> [-Language <String>] [-Mapping <String>] -Owner <SearchObjectOwner>
 [-SearchApplication <SearchServiceApplicationPipeBind>] [-SourceId <Guid>] [-Type <LanguageResourceType>]

```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchLanguageResourcePhrase` cmdlet deletes one or more language resource phrases from the collection of language resource phrases in a shared search application.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
$searchapp = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication "SearchApp1"
$obsoletephrase = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchLanguageResourcePhrase -SearchApplication $searchapp -Language en-us -Type QuerySuggestionBlockList -Identity secret
$obsoletephrase | Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchLanguageResourcePhrase -SearchApplication $searchapp -Type QuerySuggestionBlockList -Language en-us
```

This example removes a language resource item on the QuerySuggestionBlockList for the en-us language.


## PARAMETERS

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
