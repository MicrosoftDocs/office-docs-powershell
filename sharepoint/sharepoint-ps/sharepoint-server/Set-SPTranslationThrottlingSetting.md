# Set-SPTranslationThrottlingSetting

## SYNOPSIS
Sets the timer job duration.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-SPTranslationThrottlingSetting [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Confirm]
 [-SiteQuota <Int32>] [-TenantQuota <Int32>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Use the Set-SPTranslationThrottlingSetting cmdlet to set the timer job duration for each site collection.

## EXAMPLES

### -----------------EXAMPLE--------------------
```
Set-SPTranslationThrottlingSetting -SiteQuota 300 -TenantQuota 600
```

This limits the Translation Timer job to spend no more than 300 seconds (5 minutes) per site collection, and no more than 600 seconds (10 minutes) per tenant.

Note: TenantQuota must be greater than or equal to SiteQuota.


## PARAMETERS

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used. 

**NOTE:** When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
