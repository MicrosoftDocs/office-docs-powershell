## DESCRIPTION
The `Set-ExcelServiceApplication` cmdlet changes global runtime properties for Excel Services Application. 
Changes to properties that are made by using this cmdlet affect all machines in the farm that are running an instance of the specified Excel Services Application Web service application.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### --------------EXAMPLE 1--------------
```
$sa = Get-SPServiceApplication | ?{$_.TypeName -eq 'Excel Services Application Web Service Application'}
Set-SPExcelServiceApplication -Identity $sa -SessionsPerUserMax 10
```

This example sets the Excel Services Application to enable each user to open no more than 10 sessions at one time on a back-end application server that runs Excel Services Application.


### --------------EXAMPLE 2--------------
```
$sa = Get-SPServiceApplication | ?{$_.TypeName -eq 'Excel Services Application Web Service Application'}
Set-SPExcelServiceApplication -Identity $sa -PrivateBytesMax -1
```
This example sets the maximum number of private bytes of memory on the computer to a value of -1, which indicates that Excel Services Application will consume 50 percent of the available memory resources.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the SPExcelServiceApplication object to update.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of an Excel Services Application Web service application in the farm (for example, MyExcelService1); or an instance of a valid SPExcelServiceApplication object.

```yaml
Type: SPExcelServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
