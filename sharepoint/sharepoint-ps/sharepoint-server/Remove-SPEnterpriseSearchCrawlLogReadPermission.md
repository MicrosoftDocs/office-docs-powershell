# Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlLogReadPermission

## SYNOPSIS
Removes permission to view crawl log information.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlLogReadPermission [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Confirm]
 [-Identity <CrawlLogReadPermissionPipeBind>] [-SearchApplication <SearchServiceApplicationPipeBind>]
 [-Tenant <Guid>] [-UserNames <String>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Only the Search Service Application administrator can use this cmdlet.

The `Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlLogReadPermission` cmdlet removes the permission to view crawl log information for one or more users.
The administrator can choose to restrict this removal to a particular tenant.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
$ssa = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication
$crawlLogPermission = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlLogReadPermission -SearchApplication $ssa -Tenant "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlLogReadPermission -Identity $crawlLogPermission -UserNames "contoso\user1;contoso\user2"
```

This example removes user1 and user2 from the list of users referenced by $crawlLogPermission.
$crawlLogPermission is the list of users who have permission to view the crawl log information from the tenant with id "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" on the search application referenced by $ssa.


## PARAMETERS

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
