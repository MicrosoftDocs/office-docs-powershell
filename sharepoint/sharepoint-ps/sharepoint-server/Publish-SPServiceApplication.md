# Publish-SPServiceApplication

## SYNOPSIS
Shares the specified local service application outside the farm.


## SYNTAX

```
Publish-SPServiceApplication [-Identity] <SPServiceApplicationPipeBind>
 [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Confirm] [-Description <String>] [-InfoLink <Uri>]
 [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Publish-SPServiceApplication` cmdlet publishes the local service application, specified by the Identity parameter, outside the farm.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE-----------------------
```
Publish-SPServiceApplication 053c34be-d251-488c-8e94-644eae94da26 -Description "Connect to this TestServiceApplcation of you want to use FeatureA in your farm" -InfoLink https://testurl
```

This example publishes a service application to another farm.

The service application GUID is unique to every farm.
You can run the `Get-SPServiceApplication` cmdlet to see the GUID of the service applications and then use the result from the `Get-SPServiceApplication` cmdlet for other SPServiceApplication cmdlets; for example, `Grant-SPServiceApplication`.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the GUID of the service application to share outside the farm.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh.

```yaml
Type: SPServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
