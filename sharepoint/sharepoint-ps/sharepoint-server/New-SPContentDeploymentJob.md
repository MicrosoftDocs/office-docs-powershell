## DESCRIPTION
The New-SPContentDeploymentJob cmdlet adds a new content deployment job to a farm.

## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------ 
```
Get-SPContentDeploymentPath "Path 1" | New-SPContentDeploymentJob -Name "Deployment Job" -SPContentDeploymentPath $_ -IncrementalEnabled:$true -ScheduleEnabled:$false
```

This example creates a new content deployment job called Deployment Job by using the deployment path Path 1.
The job is configured to be an incremental job with no schedule.

## PARAMETERS

### -Name
Specifies the name of the new content deployment job.

The type must be a valid name of a content deployment job; for example, DeployJob1.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SPContentDeploymentPath
Specifies the deployment path to associate with the new deployment job.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of a content deployment job (for example; DeployJob1); or an instance of a valid SPContentDeploymentJob object.

```yaml
Type: SPContentDeploymentPathPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before executing the command.
For more information, type the following command: `get-help about_commonparameters`

```

### -Description

The name can be a maximum of 4096 alphanumeric characters.

The type must be a valid string.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EmailAddresses

The type must be a list of valid e-mail addresses.

```yaml
Type: String[]

Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EmailNotifications
Specifies how e-mail notifications are sent about this ContentDeploymentJob object.

The type must be one of the following:

-Never specifies that e-mail notifications will not be sent when a job succeeds or fails.

- SendEmailOnSuccess specifies that e-mail notifications will be sent if a content deployment job succeeds.
- SendEmailOnFailure specifies that e-mail notifications will be sent if a content deployment job fails.

### -HostingSupportEnabled
Enables special hosting- behavior.
The default value is False.

Normally, a content deployment job is enabled or disabled by using the SharePoint Central Administration Web site.
However, in the case of hosting, the tenant administrator does not have permissions to access the Central Administration page to configure jobs.
Therefore, when the HostingSupportEnabled parameter is set to True, the hoster creates the job, so that tenants can enable or disable their deployment jobs from their tenant administration site.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019
