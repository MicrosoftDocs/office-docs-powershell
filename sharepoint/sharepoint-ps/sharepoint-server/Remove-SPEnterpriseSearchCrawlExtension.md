## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
$searchapp = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication "SearchApp1"
$searchapp | Get-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlExtension "pdf" | Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlExtension
```

This example removes the PDF IFilter and removes the pdf file extension from the list of file types to include in the content index.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The file name extension to remove.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid file name extension (for example, .xml); or an instance of a valid CrawlExtension object.

```yaml
Type: ExtensionPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False

### -SearchApplication
Specifies the search application that contains the extension collection.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid search application name (for example, SearchApp1); or an instance of a valid SearchServiceApplication object.
