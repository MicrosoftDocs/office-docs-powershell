# New-SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary

## SYNOPSIS
Adds a new data connection library to Excel Services Application.


## SYNTAX

```
New-SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary -Address <String> -ExcelServiceApplication <SPExcelServiceApplicationPipeBind>
 [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Confirm] [-Description <String>] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `New-SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary` cmdlet adds a data connection library to the list of trusted data connection libraries for an Excel Services Application Web service application. 
Excel Services Application loads only data connection files that are stored in a data connection library that is on the list of trusted data connection libraries.
Data connection libraries contain data connection files, which contain all the resources that Excel Services Application and the Excel client require to connect to an external data source.
Data connection libraries enable you to reuse and share data connections.
Data connections can be loaded by using information from the workbook file; however, using a data connection library to load data connections allows data connections to be managed separately from workbooks.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251831 (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251831).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
PS C:\>$sa = Get-SPExcelServiceApplication
PS C:\>New-SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary -Address "http://portal/site/salesDCL" -Description "This is the DCL where all the connections to the sales data are stored." -ExcelServiceApplication $sa
```

This example adds a new data connection library (DCL) and then sets its description to the list of trusted data connection libraries that is in the Excel Services Application Web service application named MyExcelService.

Workbooks can use connection files stored in that library to refresh data on the Excel Services Application Web service application.


## PARAMETERS

### -Address
Specifies the address of the data connection library.
The address must be unique in the list of trusted data connection libraries.

The type must be a valid URL, in the form http://server_name.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExcelServiceApplication
Specifies the Excel Services Application Web service application that contains the SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary list object.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of an Excel Services Application Web service application in the farm (for example, MyExcelService1); or an instance of a valid SPExcelServiceApplication object.

```yaml
Type: SPExcelServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
