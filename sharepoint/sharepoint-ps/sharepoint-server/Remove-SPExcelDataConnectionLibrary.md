# Remove-SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary

## SYNOPSIS
Removes a data connection library from Excel Services Application.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary [-Identity] <SPExcelDCLPipeBind>
 -ExcelServiceApplication <SPExcelServiceApplicationPipeBind> [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>]
 [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Remove-SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary` cmdlet removes a library from the Excel Services Application trusted data connection libraries list. 
Excel Services Application loads data connection files only if they are stored in a data connection library that is on the trusted data connection libraries list.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### -----------------------EXAMPLE-----------------------------
```
Get-SPExcelServiceApplication | Get-SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary | Remove-SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary
```

This example removes all data connection libraries from all Excel Services Application running in the farm.

Connection files are no longer loaded from any libraries.
Workbooks that depend on any connection files might not refresh data.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the data connection library to remove.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of a data connection library (for example, DataConnectionLib1); a valid URL, in the form https://server_name; or an instance of a valid SPExcelDCL object.

```yaml
Type: SPExcelDCLPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExcelServiceApplication
Specifies the Excel Services Application Web service application that contains the SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary list object.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of an Excel Services Application Web service application in the farm (for example, MyExcelService1); or an instance of a valid SPExcelServiceApplication object.

```yaml
Type: SPExcelServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
