# Remove-SPExcelBlockedFileType

## SYNOPSIS
Removes an entry from the list of file types that are prevented from loading on Excel Services Application.


## SYNTAX

 [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Remove-SPExcelBlockedExcelFileType` cmdlet removes an entry from the list of file types that are prevented from loading on an Excel Services Application Web service application. 
Excel Services Application does not load any file types that correspond to a file type that is on this list.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### -----------------------EXAMPLE-----------------------------
```
Get-SPExcelServiceApplication -Identity "MyExcelService" | Remove-SPExcelBlockedExcelFileType -FileType XLSX
```

This example removes the .xlsx file name extensions from the list of file types that are prevented from loading by Excel Services Application.

After the .xlsx file name extension is removed from the list, these extensions are allowed to load in Excel Services Application.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the file type to remove from the list of blocked file types.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; one of the following file types: XLSX, XLSB, XLSM; or an instance of a valid SPExcelBlockedFileType object.

```yaml
Type: SPExcelBlockedFileTypePipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExcelServiceApplication
Specifies the Excel Services Application Web service application that contains the SPBlockedExcelFileType list object.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of an Excel Services Application Web service application in the farm (for example, MyExcelService1); or an instance of a valid SPExcelServiceApplication object.

```yaml
Type: SPExcelServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
