## DESCRIPTION
The `Set-SPContentDeploymentJob` cmdlet sets the properties of a content deployment job.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### -----------------EXAMPLE------------------

```

This example sets the deployment job called Job 1 to run hourly.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the content deployment job to update.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of a content deployment job (for example, DeployJob1); or an instance of a valid SPContentDeploymentJob object.

```yaml
Type: SPContentDeploymentJobPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before executing the command.
For more information, type the following command: `get-help about_commonparameters`

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Description
Specifies the description for the content deployment job.
The name can be a maximum of 4096 alphanumeric characters.

The type must be a valid string.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EmailAddresses
Specifies the e-mail addresses of individuals who receive notification e-mails about this ContentDeploymentJob object.

The type must be a list of valid e-mail addresses.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EmailNotifications
Specifies how e-mail notifications are sent about this ContentDeploymentJob object.

The type must be one of the following:

-Never specifies that e-mail notifications will not be sent when a job succeeds or fails.

- Success specifies that e-mail notifications will be sent if a content deployment job succeeds.
- Failure specifies that e-mail notifications will be sent if a content deployment job fails.
- Always specifies that e-mail notifications will be sent when a job succeeds or fails.

```yaml
Type: ContentDeploymentNotificationSettings
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -HostingSupportEnabled
Enables special hosting behavior.
The default value is False.

Normally, a content deployment job is enabled or disabled by using the SharePoint Central Administration Web site.
However, in the case of hosting, the tenant administrator does not have permissions to access the Central Administration page to configure jobs.
Therefore, when the HostingSupportEnabled parameter is set to True, the hoster creates the job, so that tenants can enable or disable their deployment jobs from their tenant administration site.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IncrementalEnabled
Specifies that only incremental changes are deployed to the destination site collection.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Specifies the name of the new content deployment job.

The type must be a valid name of a content deployment job; for example, DeployJob1.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ScheduleEnabled

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None

```

### -Scope
