# Update-SPSolution

## SYNOPSIS
Upgrades a deployed SharePoint solution.


## SYNTAX

```
Update-SPSolution [-Identity] <SPSolutionPipeBind> -LiteralPath <String>
 [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-CASPolicies] [-Confirm] [-Force] [-GACDeployment] [-Local]
 [-Time <String>] [-WhatIf] [-FullTrustBinDeployment] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Update-SPSolution` cmdlet upgrades a deployed SharePoint solution in the farm.
Use this cmdlet only if a new solution contains the same set of files and features as the deployed solution.
If files and features are different, the solution must be retracted and redeployed by using the `Uninstall-SPSolution` and `Install-SPSolution` cmdlets, respectively.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).

## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
Update-SPSolution -Identity contoso_solution.wsp -LiteralPath c:\contoso_solution_v2.wsp -GACDeployment
```

This example upgrades the deployed SharePoint solution  contoso_solution.wsp to the solution c:\contoso_solution_v2.wsp.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the SharePoint solution to deploy.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of a SharePoint solution (for example, SPSolution1); or an instance of a valid SPSolution object.

```yaml
Type: SPSolutionPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LiteralPath
Specifies the path to the solution package.

The type must be a valid path in either of the following forms:

- C:\folder_name
- \\\\server_name\folder_name

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
