## DESCRIPTION
Use the `Set-SPAppStateUpdateInterval` cmdlet to set the interval in hours between updates of the app state update job.
The app state update job updates the app states, including app updates, in SharePoint based on information in the SharePoint Store.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### -------------EXAMPLE--------------
```
Set-SPAppStateUpdateInterval -AppStateSyncHours 24 -FastAppRevocationHours 6
```

This example sets the app state update interval to 24 hours and the fast app revocation interval to 6 hours.


## PARAMETERS

### -AppStateSyncHours
Specifies the interval in hours between updates of the app states.
Values are 1 to 24 inclusive.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -FastAppRevocationHours
Specifies the interval in hours between checks of the list of revoked apps in the SharePoint Store.
If the list of revoked apps has changed from the last time, the app states are updated.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
