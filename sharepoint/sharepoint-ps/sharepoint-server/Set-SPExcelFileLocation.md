## DESCRIPTION
The `Set-SPExcelFileLocation` cmdlet sets properties of a location from which Excel Services Application loads workbooks.
Excel Services Application  loads only workbooks that are stored in a trusted file location.
Properties of trusted file locations control how workbooks can be used when they are loaded on Excel Services Application.
Excel Services Application always enforces the properties that are defined by the trusted file location from which a workbook was loaded.
The properties that are used by the trusted file location are determined by comparison of the file path for the workbook with the Address parameter of the trusted file location.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### --------------EXAMPLE 1--------------
```
Get-SPExcelFileLocation -ExcelServiceApplication "My Excel Service" | where { $_.externaldataallowed -eq "DclAndEmbedded"} | Set-SPExcelFileLocation -ExernalDataAllowed Dcl
```

This example gets every trusted file location for the Excel Services Application Web service application named My Excel Service that allows data connections to load from workbook files and specifies that the locations must use a data connection library to load data connections.


### --------------EXAMPLE 2--------------
```
Get-SPExcelServiceApplication | Get-SPExcelFileLocation | where {$_.Address -eq "https://"} | Set-SPExcelFileLocation -Description "This is the default trusted file location for Excel Services Application. It allows any file from anywhere in SharePoint to load."
```

This example changes the description of the default file location for every Excel Services Application Web service application in the farm.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the FileLocation object to update.
The name must be unique in the list of file locations.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid string identifying the file location, in the form https://myPortal/myTeam; a valid string identifying the path, in the form C:\folder_name; or an instance of a valid SPExcelFileLocation object.

```yaml
Type: SPExcelFileLocationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExcelServiceApplication
Specifies the Excel Services Application Web service application that contains the SPExcelFileLocation list object.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of an Excel Services Application Web service application in the farm (for example, MyExcelService1); or an instance of a valid SPExcelServiceApplication object.

```yaml
Type: SPExcelServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AbortOnRefreshOnOpenFail
Specifies that the load of a Excel Services Application file automatically fails if an automatic data refresh operation fails when the file is opened.
The load is failed only if the following conditions are true:

-- User has read-only permissions to the Excel Services Application file.
-- Workbook file has data connections that refresh automatically when the Excel file is opened.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Address
System.String

Specifies a Web folder, or file directory from which Excel Services Application can load workbooks.

The type must be a valid URL, in the form https://myPortal/myTeam; or a valid UNC path in form, \\\\server_name\folder_name

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
