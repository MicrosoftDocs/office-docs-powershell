## DESCRIPTION
The New-SPAccessServiceApplication cmdlet creates a new instance of an Access Services application in SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013.
After you create a new Access Services application, use the Set-SPAccessServiceApplication cmdlet to modify its global settings.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251831 (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251831).

## EXAMPLES

### ------------EXAMPLE 1---------------- 
```
C:\PS>New-SPAccessServiceApplication -Name "MyAccessService" -SPIisWebServiceApplicationPool MyAppPool
```

This example creates a new instance of Access Services named MyAccessService that runs under the application pool named MyAppPool.

### ------------EXAMPLE 2---------------- 
```
C:\PS>New-SPAccessServiceApplication -Name "MyAccessService" -SPIisWebServiceApplicationPool MyAppPool -SessionsPerUserMax 25
```

This example creates a new instance of Access Services named MyAccessService that runs under the application pool named MyAppPool, which allows up to 25 sessions per user on each back end application server machine on which Access Services runs.

## PARAMETERS

### -Name
Specifies the display name of the Access Services application to create.
The name can contain a maximum of 128 characters and can contain the comma (,), equal sign (=), or colon (:) characters provided they are enclosed in quotation marks.

The type must be a valid name of an Access Services application; for example, AccessSrvApp1.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ApplicationPool
Specifies the existing Internet Information Services (IIS) application pool to run the Web service in for the new Access Services application.

The type must be a valid instance of a SPIisWebServiceApplicationPool object.

```yaml
Type: SPIisWebServiceApplicationPoolPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)

```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
