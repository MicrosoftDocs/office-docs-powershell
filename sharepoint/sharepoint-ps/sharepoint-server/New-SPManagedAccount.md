## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE-----------------------
```
PS C:\>$cred = Get-Credential
PS C:\>New-SPManagedAccount -Credential $cred
```

This example adds a new managed account to the farm by using credentials that are prompted.


## PARAMETERS

### -Credential
Indicates the Credential object that specifies the credentials of the new managed account.
If you use Credential, you cannot specify Username and Password.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)

Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016
