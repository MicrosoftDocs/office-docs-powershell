## DESCRIPTION
The New-SPContentDeploymentPath cmdlet adds a new content deployment path for a content deployment job.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).

## EXAMPLES

### -----------------EXAMPLE---------------------- 
```
C:\PS>$source = Get-SPSite "http://source/"

C:\PS>$credentials=Get-Credential

New-SPContentDeploymentPath -Name "Deployment Path" -SourceSPWebApplication $source.WebApplication -SourceSPSite $source DestinationCentralAdministrationURL "http://destination:8080" -DestinationSPWebApplication "http://destination" -DestinationSPSite "http://destination" -KeepTemporaryFilesOptions "Failure" -PathAccount $credentials -PathEnabled:$true
```

This example creates a new deployment path called Deployment Path that connects a source at http://source to a destination at http://destination.
The path is enabled and configured to keep temporary files on job failure.

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False

Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019
