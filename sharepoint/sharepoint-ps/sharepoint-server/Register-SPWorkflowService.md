## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet registers a Workflow Manager farm with the SharePoint farm in order to allow users to leverage SharePoint 2013 workflows.


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
Register-SPWorkflowService -SPSite https://site_name -WorkflowHostUri https://workflow.contoso.com:12290 -ScopeName SharePoint
```
Registers the Workflow Manager farm located at https://workflow.contoso.com:12290 with the SharePoint farm using https://site_name as a reference. A custom Scope named 'SharePoint' is used.

## PARAMETERS

### -AllowOAuthHttp
Allows connecting to Workflow Manager using HTTP rather than HTTPS. This is not recommended for security.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None

```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
