# Get-SPDeletedSite

## SYNOPSIS

Gets a list of deleted site collections.



## SYNTAX

```
Get-SPDeletedSite [-Identity] <SPDeletedSitePipeBind> [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>]
 [-Confirm] [-ContentDatabase <SPContentDatabasePipeBind>] [-DateTimeFrom <String>] [-DateTimeTo <String>]
 [-Limit <String>] [-SiteSubscription <SPSiteSubscriptionPipeBind>]
 [-WebApplication <SPWebApplicationPipeBind>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet contains more than one parameter set.
You may only use parameters from one parameter set, and you may not combine parameters from different parameter sets.
For more information about how to use parameter sets, see [Cmdlet parameter sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-parameter-sets).

This cmdlet was introduced in SharePoint Server with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and SharePoint Foundation with Service Pack 1 (SP1).

Use the Get-SPDeletedSite cmdlet to display a list of deleted site collections by using the Identity parameter.
If no parameter is specified, then all deleted site collections in the farm are displayed. Deleted Sites are sites in the process of gradual delete. For more information on gradual delete, see [Remove-SPSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/remove-spsite?view=sharepoint-ps).

Unlike the Get-SPSite cmdlet that uses the host name and scheme for the Identity parameter (that is, https://server_name), the value of the identity parameter for all SPDeletedSite cmdlets use a server-relative URL.
Typically, the forward slash character (/) begins the relative URL and also denotes the root site.

For additional information about a server-relative URL or understanding general concepts about absolute and relative URLs, see Server-relative URL Property (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spsite.serverrelativeurl.aspx) or Understanding Absolute and Relative URL Addresses (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb208688(office.12).aspx).

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).

## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE 1--------------------- 
```
Get-SPDeletedSite -Identity 610857cb-8414-4a89-8bf3-ad3628f6c86c
```

This example gets a specific deleted site collection by using a site ID.

### ------------------EXAMPLE 2--------------------- 
```
Get-SPDeletedSite "/"
```

This example gets a deleted site collection from the root site.

### ------------------EXAMPLE 3--------------------- 
```
Get-SPDeletedSite '/Site/cat*'
```

This example matches a deleted site collection that contains any combination with the string "cat".
The asterisk (*) wildcard character requests a match for multiple characters.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the URL or GUID of the site collection to get.

The identity can be either a valid server-relative URL in the form /sites/site_name or a valid GUID, for example, 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh.

```yaml
Type: SPDeletedSitePipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
