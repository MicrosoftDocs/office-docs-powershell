## SYNOPSIS
Removes an instance of a performance counter.


## SYNTAX

```
Remove-SPDiagnosticsPerformanceCounter [-Category] <String> [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>]
 [-Confirm] [-Counter <String>] [-DatabaseServer] [-Instance <String>] [-WebFrontEnd] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Remove-SPDiagnosticsPerformanceCounter` cmdlet removes performance counters from the collection of performance counters that are read and recorded in the usage database.
This cmdlet can also be used to remove entire categories and types of counters from the collection.
If either the DatabaseServer or WebFrontEnd parameters are not specified, this cmdlet removes the specified performance counters on the front end Web servers in the farm.

The `Remove-SPDiagnosticsPerformanceCounter` cmdlet is only available by using Windows PowerShell.
There is no user interface.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE 1------------------
```
Remove-SPDiagnosticsPerformanceCounter -category ASP.NET
```

This example removes all the counters in the category ASP.NET on front end Web servers.


### ------------------EXAMPLE 2------------------
```
Remove-SPDiagnosticsPerformanceCounter -category ASP.NET -Counter "Requests Queued"
```

This example removes the counters in the category ASP.NET that have requests queued on front end Web servers.


### ------------------EXAMPLE 3------------------
```
Remove-SPDiagnosticsPerformanceCounter -category Processor -counter "% Processor Time" -instance "_Total" -databaseserver
```

This example removes the counters of the _Total instance, with the counter % Processor Time in the category Processor on database servers.


## PARAMETERS

### -Category
Specifies the category of performance counters to remove.

The type must be a valid name of a category of performance counters; for example, ASP.NET, PhysicalDisk, or Processor.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
