## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet deletes a specified managed property from the managed property collection.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
$searchapp = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication 
$mp = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchMetadataManagedProperty -SearchApplication $searchapp -Identity AboutMeUpdate 
Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchMetadataManagedProperty -Identity $mp
```

This example removes the managed property AboutMeUpdate from the default search service application.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the managed property to delete.

The type must be a valid name of a managed property, for example ManagedProperty1, or an instance of a valid ManagedProperty object.

Note that if only a name of a managed property is specified, a SearchApplication must also be specified.

```yaml
Type: ManagedPropertyPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

### -SearchApplication
Specifies the search application that contains the managed property collection.
