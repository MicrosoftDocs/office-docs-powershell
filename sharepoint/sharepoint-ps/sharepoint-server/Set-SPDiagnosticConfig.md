## DESCRIPTION
Use the `Set-SPDiagnosticConfig` cmdlet to set diagnostic configuration settings on the entire farm.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251831 (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251831).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE 1-----------------------
```
C:\PS>set-spdiagnosticconfig -errorReportingEnable -DownloadErrorReportingUpdatesEnabled:$false -DaysToKeepLog  60
```

This example enables ErrorReporting, disables DownloadErrorReportingUpdatesEnable and sets DaysToKeepLog to 60.


### ------------------EXAMPLE 2-----------------------
```
C:\PS>$L = get-spdiagnosticconfig

C:\PS>$L.CustomerExperienceImprovementProgramEnabled = $false

C:\PS>$L.LogCutInterval = 60

C:\PS>$L | Set-SPDiagnosticConfig
```

This example disables CEIP and sets LogCutInterval to 60 minutes.


## PARAMETERS

### -AllowLegacyTraceProviders
Specifies that trace providers built for previous versions of SharePoint Products and Technologies can write to the trace session for SharePoint Products.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AppAnalyticsAutomaticUploadEnabled
Specifies whether aggregated app usage data is automatically uploaded to Microsoft.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
