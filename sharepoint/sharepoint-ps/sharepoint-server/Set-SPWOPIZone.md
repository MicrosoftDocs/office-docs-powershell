# Set-SPWOPIZone

## SYNOPSIS
Configures the zone that the current SharePoint farm will use to navigate the browser to the WOPI application.


## SYNTAX

```
Set-SPWOPIZone [[-Zone] <String>] [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Set-SPWOPIZone` cmdlet configures the zone that the current SharePoint farm will use to navigate the browser to the WOPI application (such as a server that runs Office Web Apps Server).
The SharePoint Server page in the browser creates a frame that contains a page on the WOPI application.
The zone for the URL of the WOPI application page is determined by this setting.

If you do not set the zone, the default is "internal-HTTPS." If you select a zone that is not supported by the WOPI application, Office Web Apps will not work.
Only use HTTP when you are on a fully secure network that uses IPSEC (full encryption) or in a test environment that does not contain sensitive data.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### --------------EXAMPLE-----------------
```
Set-SPWOPIZone -Zone "external-https"
```

This example configures the current SharePoint farm to use external connections through HTTPS to the WOPI application (such as a server that runs Office Web Apps Server).


## PARAMETERS

### -Zone
Specifies the zone.
For a list of zones that the WOPI application supports, run `Get-SPWOPIBinding`.

If you have a SharePoint farm that's internal and external, specify external.
If you have a SharePoint farm that's internal only, specify internal.
Only use HTTP when you are on a fully secure network that uses IPSEC (full encryption) or in a test environment that does not contain sensitive data.
The options are as follows:

- Internal-HTTP
- Internal-HTTPS
- External-HTTP
- External-HTTPS

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
