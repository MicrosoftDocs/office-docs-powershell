## DESCRIPTION

This cmdlet imports a custom extraction dictionary from a .cvs file and deploys it to the extraction sub flow.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251831 (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251831).

## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE----------------- 
```
PS C:\>$searchApp = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication
PS C:\>Import-SPEnterpriseSearchCustomExtractionDictionary -SearchApplication $searchApp -Filename c:\transfer\entity_extraction.csv -DictionaryName Microsoft.UserDictionaries.EntityExtraction.Custom.Word.1
```

This example imports the custom extraction dictionary that is located at c:\transfer to the default search service application.
The entries of this dictionary will be matched in a case-insensitive way against the terms in the documents being indexed.

## PARAMETERS

### -DictionaryName
Specifies the name of the target dictionary.
The name must be one of the following 12 predefined dictionaries.
The name signifies the "case sensitivity" and "token matching" behavior.

```yaml

Required: True

```yaml

### -SearchApplication

Specifies the search service application to which the custom extraction dictionary should be imported.



```yaml
Type: SearchServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)

Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
