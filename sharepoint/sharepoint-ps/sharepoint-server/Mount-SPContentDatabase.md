## DESCRIPTION
The Mount-SPContentDatabase cmdlet attaches an existing content database to the farm.
If the database being mounted requires an upgrade, this cmdlet will cause the database to be upgraded.
NOTE: Please be aware that if a content database that does not exists is specified, it will be created by this cmdlet.

The default behavior of this cmdlet causes an upgrade of the schema of the database and initiates upgraded builds for all site collections within the specified content database if required.
To prevent initiation of upgraded builds of site collections, use the NoB2BSiteUpgrade parameter.
This cmdlet does not trigger version-to-version upgrade of any site collections.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).

## EXAMPLES

### -----------------EXAMPLE 1--------------------- 
```
Mount-SPContentDatabase "MyDatabase" -DatabaseServer "MyServer" -WebApplication https://sitename
```

This example mounts an existing database to the sitename web application.
If upgrades are required, it triggers database schema upgrade and then performs only build-to-build upgrade actions on existing site collections if required.
This operation does not changed the CompatibilityLevel for existing site collections in this database.

### -----------------EXAMPLE 2--------------------- 
```
Mount-SPContentDatabase "MyDatabase" -DatabaseServer "MyServer" -WebApplication https://sitename -NoB2BSiteUpgrade
```

This example mounts an existing database to the sitename web application but it prevents any site upgrades from occurring.
If upgrades are required, it triggers database schema upgrades only and no build-to-build upgrade actions are performed on any site collections.
This operation does not change the CompatibilityLevel for existing site collections in this database.

## PARAMETERS

### -Name
Specifies the existing content database to attach to the farm.

The type must be a valid name of a SharePoint content database; for example, SPContentDB1.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WebApplication
Attaches the content database to the specified SharePoint web application.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of SharePoint web application (for example, MyOfficeApp1); or an instance of a valid SPWebApplication object.

```yaml
Type: SPWebApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
