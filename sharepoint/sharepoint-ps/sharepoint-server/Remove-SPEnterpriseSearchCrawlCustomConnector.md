## EXAMPLES

### --------------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
Get-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlCustomConnector -SearchApplication MySearchServiceApp" - Identity "dctm://" | Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlCustomConnector
```

This example removes a custom connector for the dctm:// protocol from the MySearchServiceApp search service application.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the CustomConnector object to remove.
The Identity parameter must be an instance of a valid CustomConnector object.

```yaml
Type: SPCustomConnectorPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: False

Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
