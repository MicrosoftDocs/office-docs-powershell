# Set-SPEnterpriseSearchMetadataCategory

## SYNOPSIS
Sets properties of a crawled property category.


## SYNTAX

```
Set-SPEnterpriseSearchMetadataCategory [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>]
 [-AutoCreateNewManagedProperties <Boolean>] [-Confirm] [-DiscoverNewProperties <Boolean>]
 -Identity <CategoryPipeBind> [-MapToContents <Boolean>] [-Name <String>]
 [-SearchApplication <SearchServiceApplicationPipeBind>] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet updates properties of a crawled property category when the search functionality is configured for the first time and after a new crawled property category is discovered during a crawl.
SPEnterpriseSearchMetadataCategory represents a category in the enterprise search metadata property schema.

Note that a category may represent multiple propsets.
Changes to the category will overwrite all propsets.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
$ssa = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication
Set-SPEnterpriseSearchMetadataCategory -Identity People -SearchApplication $ssa -DiscoverNewProperties $false -MapToContents $false
```

This example sets both DiscoverNewProperties and MapToContents properties to False for the People category for the default search service application.


## PARAMETERS

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
