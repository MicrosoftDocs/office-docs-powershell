## SYNOPSIS
Resumes a paused state service database so that new rows of data are received.

## DESCRIPTION
The `Resume-SPStateServiceDatabase` cmdlet resumes a paused state service database, an operation that adds the state service database to the set of databases that can receive new data as required by SharePoint Server applications.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).


## EXAMPLES

### --------------EXAMPLE------------------
```
$db = Get-SPStateServiceDatabase -Identity StateServceDbName
Resume-SPStateServiceDatabase -Identity $db
```

This example resumes a paused state service database.


## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Specifies the state service database to resume.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of a state database (for example, StateSvcDB1); or an instance of a valid SPStateServiceDatabase object.

```yaml
Type: SPStateDatabasePipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Name
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
