## DESCRIPTION

You can use the `Set-SPOTenant` cmdlet to enable external services and to specify the versions in which site collections can be created.
You can also use the `Set-SPOSite` cmdlet together with the `Set-SPOTenant` cmdlet to block access to a site in your organization and redirect traffic to another site.

You must be a SharePoint Online administrator or Global Administrator to run the cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 1-----------------------------

```powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team1 -LockState NoAccess
Set-SPOTenant -NoAccessRedirectUrl 'https://www.contoso.com'
```

This example blocks access to <https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team1> and redirects traffic to <https://www.contoso.com.>

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 2-----------------------------

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ShowEveryoneExceptExternalUsersClaim $false
```

This example hides the "Everyone Except External Users" claim in People Picker.

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 3-----------------------------

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ShowAllUsersClaim $false
```

This example hides the "All Users" claim group in People Picker.

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 4-----------------------------

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -UsePersistentCookiesForExplorerView $true
```

This example enables the use of special persisted cookie for Open with Explorer.

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 5-----------------------------

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -LegacyAuthProtocolsEnabled $True
```

This example enables legacy authentication protocols on the tenant. This can help to enable login in situations where the admin users get an error like "Cannot contact web site '<https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/'> or the web site does not support SharePoint Online credentials. The response status code is 'Unauthorized'.", and the underlying error is "Access denied. Before opening files in this location, you must first browse to the web site and select the option to login automatically."

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 6------------------------------

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ContentTypeSyncSiteTemplatesList MySites
```

This example enables Content Type Hub to push content types to all OneDrive for Business sites. There is no change in Content Type Publishing behavior for other sites.

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 7-------------------------------

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ContentTypeSyncSiteTemplatesList MySites -ExcludeSiteTemplate
```

This example stops publishing content types to OneDrive for Business sites.

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 8-------------------------------

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -SearchResolveExactEmailOrUPN $true
```

This example disables starts with for all users/partial name search functionality for all SharePoint users, except SharePoint Admins.

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 9-------------------------------

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -UseFindPeopleInPeoplePicker $true
```

This example enables tenant admins to enable ODB and SPO to respect Exchange supports Address Book Policy (ABP) policies in the people picker.

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 10-------------------------------

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ShowPeoplePickerSuggestionsForGuestUsers $true
```

This example enable the option to search for existing guest users at Tenant Level.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)

### -SignInAccelerationDomain

Specifies the home realm discovery value to be sent to Azure Active Directory (AAD) during the user sign-in process.

When the organization uses a third-party identity provider, this prevents the user from seeing the Azure Active Directory Home Realm Discovery web page and ensures the user only sees their company's Identity Provider's portal.
This value can also be used with Azure Active Directory Premium to customize the Azure Active Directory login page.

Acceleration will not occur on site collections that are shared externally.

This value should be configured with the login domain that is used by your company (that is, example@contoso.com).

If your company has multiple third-party identity providers, configuring the sign-in acceleration value will break sign-in for your organization.

The valid values are:  

- "" (default) - Blank by default, this will also remove or clear any value that has been set.  
- Login Domain - For example: "contoso.com"

Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named

Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UsePersistentCookiesForExplorerView

Lets SharePoint issue a special cookie that will allow this feature to work even when "Keep Me Signed In" is not selected.

"Open with Explorer" requires persisted cookies to operate correctly.
When the user does not select "Keep Me Signed in" at the time of sign-in, "Open with Explorer" will fail.

This special cookie expires after 30 minutes and cannot be cleared by closing the browser or signing out of SharePoint Online.
To clear this cookie, the user must log out of their Windows session.

The valid values are:  

- False (default) - No special cookie is generated and the normal Office 365 sign-in length/timing applies.  
- True - Generates a special cookie that will allow "Open with Explorer" to function if the "Keep Me Signed In" box is not checked at sign-in.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False

PARAMVALUE: $true | $false

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DefaultLinkPermission

Lets administrators choose the default permission of the link in the sharing dialog box in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online. This applies to anonymous access, internal and direct links.

The valid values are None (non settable), View and Edit.

```yaml
Type: SharingPermissionType
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DefaultSharingLinkType

```yaml
Type: SharingLinkType
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisabledWebPartIds

Allows administrators prevent certain, specific web parts from being added to pages or rendering on pages on which they were previously added. Currently, only Amazon Kindle, YouTube and Twitter web parts can be disabled in such a manner.

To disable a specific web part you need to enter its GUID as the parameter: Amazon Kindle (46698648-fcd5-41fc-9526-c7f7b2ace919), YouTube (544dd15b-cf3c-441b-96da-004d5a8cea1d), Twitter (f6fdf4f8-4a24-437b-a127-32e66a5dd9b4). If you are looking for a GUID for any other web part, easiest way to achieve is to place the web part on a SharePoint page and move to maintenance mode. See more details around the [web part maintenance mode from Microsoft Support](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-and-use-the-Web-Part-Maintenance-Page-EFF9CE22-D04A-44DD-AE83-AC29A5E396C2).

You can enter in multiple GUIDs by using a comma to separate them, for example Set-SPOTenant -DisabledWebPartIds 46698648-fcd5-41fc-9526-c7f7b2ace919,544dd15b-cf3c-441b-96da-004d5a8cea1d. To view a list of disabled web parts, use Get-SPOTenant to get DisabledWebPartIds.

To re-enable some disabled web parts, use the Set-SPOTenant with the -DisabledWebPartIds parameter and corresponding GUIDs that you still want to keep disabling. To re-enable all disabled web parts, use Set-SPOTenant -DisabledWebPartIds @().

```yaml
Type: Guid[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named

> [!NOTE]
> The IPAddressAllowList parameter only lets administrators set IP addresses or ranges that are recognized as trusted. To only grant access from these IP addresses or ranges, set the IPAddressEnforcement parameter to $true.
