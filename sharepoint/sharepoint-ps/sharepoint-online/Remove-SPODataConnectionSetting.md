## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

Specifies the OData Connection Settings object.

```yaml
Type: ODataConnectionSettings
Parameter Sets: Identity
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ServiceContext

Specifies the service context which is in the form of an instance of an SPServiceContext object, an SPSiteAdministration object identifier, or a SPSite object.
An example of a service context value is an identifier from the ID field, a string identifier, a URI, or a string representation of a GUID.

```yaml
Type: SPServiceContextPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name

Specifies the name of the existing Business Connectivity Services connection.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: Name
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection

Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
