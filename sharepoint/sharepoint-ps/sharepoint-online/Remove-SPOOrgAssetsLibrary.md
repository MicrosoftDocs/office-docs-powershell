# Remove-SPOOrgAssetsLibrary

## SYNOPSIS

Removes a library that was designated as a central location for organization assets across the tenant.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Remove-SPOOrgAssetsLibrary [-LibraryUrl <String>] [-ListId <Guid>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The Remove-SPOOrgAssetsLibrary cmdlet removes a library that was designated as a central location for organization assets across the tenant. Once this cmdlet is run, this library will no longer be accessible from the "Your organization" tab in the file picker. When running the cmdlet, either the library URL or library ID (not both) needs to be indicated.

Once the library is removed, CDN will still be enabled for this library. To disable CDN for this library, use Remove-SPOTenantCdnOrigin with the server relative URL (example: /sites/branding/assets).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

This example removes https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/branding/Assets as a designated library using the library ID. Assets within this library will no longer be accessible from the "Your organization" tab in the file picker.

```powershell
Remove-SPOOrgAssetsLibrary -ListId 58454454-6546-6466-9769-646464623988
```

### Example 2

This example removes https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/branding/Assets as a designated library using the library URL. Assets within this library will no longer be accessible from the "Your organization" tab in the file picker.

```powershell

```
