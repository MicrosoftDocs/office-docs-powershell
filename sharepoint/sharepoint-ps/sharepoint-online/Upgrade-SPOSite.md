# Upgrade-SPOSite

## SYNOPSIS

Starts the upgrade process on a site collection.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Upgrade-SPOSite [-Confirm] -Identity <SpoSitePipeBind> [-NoEmail] [-QueueOnly] [-VersionUpgrade] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Upgrade-SPOSite` cmdlet activates the upgrade process for the specified SharePoint Online site collection.
This cmdlet can also be used to resume failed upgrades.

When upgrade is initiated, it can either be a build-to-build or version-to-version upgrade.
The default is build-to-build upgrade.
When in version-to-version upgrade, site collection health checks are first run in repair mode to ensure that the site collection can be upgraded successfully.

You must be a SharePoint Online administrator or Global Administrator and be a site collection administrator to run the cmdlet.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Online, see the online documentation at [Intro to SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell?view=sharepoint-ps).
