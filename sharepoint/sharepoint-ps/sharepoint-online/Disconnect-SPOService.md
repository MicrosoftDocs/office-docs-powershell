# Disconnect-SPOService

## SYNOPSIS
Disconnects from a SharePoint Online service.

## SYNTAX

```
Disconnect-SPOService [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Disconnect-SPOService cmdlet explicitly disconnects a previously created SharePoint Online service connection.

Global administrators can disconnect the service by running the Disconnect-SPOService cmdlet or by running the Connect-SPOService cmdlet to initiate another connection.
For more information, see Connect-SPOService.

Even after a connection is terminated, operations that were started before the connection is terminated will run to completion.
In other words, long-running operations will not be terminated by running the Disconnect-SPOService cmdlet or the Connect-SPOService cmdlet.

You must be a SharePoint Online global administrator to run the cmdlet.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Online, see the online documentation at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251832 (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251832).
