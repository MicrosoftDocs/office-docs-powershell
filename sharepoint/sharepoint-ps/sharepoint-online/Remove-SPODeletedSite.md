# Remove-SPODeletedSite

## SYNOPSIS

Removes a SharePoint Online deleted site collection from the Recycle Bin.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Remove-SPODeletedSite [-Confirm] -Identity <SpoSitePipeBind> [-NoWait] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Remove-SPODeletedSite` cmdlet permanently removes a SharePoint Online deleted site collection from the Recycle Bin.

You must be a SharePoint Administrator or Global Administrator to run the cmdlet.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Online, see the online documentation at [Intro to SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell?view=sharepoint-ps).

**Note**: As of today, the modern admin center UI does not allow permanent deletion of group connected site, but the use of this cmdlet does allow the deletion, but when this occurs it does not delete the associated group, just the site.
