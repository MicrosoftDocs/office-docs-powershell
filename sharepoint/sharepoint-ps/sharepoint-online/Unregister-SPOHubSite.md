# Unregister-SPOHubSite

## SYNOPSIS
Disables the hub site feature on a site.

## SYNTAX

```
Unregister-SPOHubSite [-Identity] <SpoHubSitePipeBind>
[-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
[<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Disables the hub site feature on a site so that it is no longer a hub site. Associated sites may still appear associated for up to an hour. If you want to speed up the process, use the Remove-SPOHubSiteAssociation cmdlet to remove the associates sites first.

If the site doesn’t exist, this cmdlet returns a “File not found” error.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```
Unregister-SPOHubSite -Identity <guid>
```

This example removes a site from the hub site list based on unique hub identifier (<guid>).

### Example 2

```
Unregister-SPOHubSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Marketing
```

This example disables the hub feature on the marketing site.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

Guid based identifier or URL of the site to disable the hub site feature. If hub site has been already deleted, you will need to use a Guid based identifier to remove the site from the list of hub sites.
