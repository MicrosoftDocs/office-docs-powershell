# Request-SPOUpgradeEvaluationSite

## SYNOPSIS
Requests to create a copy of an existing site collection for the purposes of validating the effects of upgrade without affecting the original site.


## SYNTAX

```
Request-SPOUpgradeEvaluationSite [-Confirm] -Identity <SpoSitePipeBind> [-NoEmail] [-NoUpgrade] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Request-SPOUpgradeEvaluationSite` cmdlet lets the SharePoint Online global administrator request a copy of an existing site collection for the purposes of validating the effects of upgrade without affecting the original site.

A request for an upgrade evaluation site is not automatically processed.
Instead, it is scheduled to occur on the background when it causes the least effect on the service.

You must be a SharePoint Online global administrator to run the cmdlet.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Online, see the online documentation at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251832 (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251832).


## EXAMPLES

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 1-----------------------------
```
Request-SPOUpgradeEvaluationSite http://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing
```
Example 1 requests a site upgrade evaluation for the marketing site http://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing using the default options of sending an email message and automatically trying to upgrade the evaluation site.


### -----------------------EXAMPLE 2-----------------------------
```
Request-SPOUpgradeEvaluationSite http://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing -NoEmail $true -NoUpgrade $true
```
This example requests a site upgrade evaluation for the marketing site http://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing. It specifies to not send email messages and not automatically try upgrade of the evaluation site. By using the cmdlet in this way, a SharePoint Online global administrator can make changes to the upgrade evaluation site before starting the actual upgrade.
