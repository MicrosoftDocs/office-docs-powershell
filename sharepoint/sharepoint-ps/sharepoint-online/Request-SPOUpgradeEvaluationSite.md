# Request-SPOUpgradeEvaluationSite

## SYNOPSIS

Requests to create a copy of an existing site collection for the purposes of validating the effects of upgrade without affecting the original site.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Request-SPOUpgradeEvaluationSite [-Confirm] -Identity <SpoSitePipeBind> [-NoEmail] [-NoUpgrade] [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Request-SPOUpgradeEvaluationSite` cmdlet lets the SharePoint Online administrator request a copy of an existing site collection for the purposes of validating the effects of upgrade without affecting the original site.

A request for an upgrade evaluation site is not automatically processed.
Instead, it is scheduled to occur on the background when it causes the least effect on the service.

You must be a SharePoint Online administrator or Global Administrator to run the cmdlet.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Online, see the online documentation at [Intro to SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell?view=sharepoint-ps).

## EXAMPLES

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 1-----------------------------

```powershell
Request-SPOUpgradeEvaluationSite https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing
```

Example 1 requests a site upgrade evaluation for the marketing site <https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing> using the default options of sending an email message and automatically trying to upgrade the evaluation site.

### -----------------------EXAMPLE 2-----------------------------

```powershell
Request-SPOUpgradeEvaluationSite https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing -NoEmail $true -NoUpgrade $true
```

This example requests a site upgrade evaluation for the marketing site <https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing.> It specifies to not send email messages and not automatically try upgrade of the evaluation site. By using the cmdlet in this way, a SharePoint Online administrator or Global Administrator can make changes to the upgrade evaluation site before starting the actual upgrade.
