# Disconnect-PnPOnline

## SYNOPSIS

> [!TIP]
> We encourage you to make improvements to this documentation. Please navigate to https://github.com/pnp/powershell/blob/dev/documentation/Disconnect-PnPOnline.md to change this file.

Disconnects the context.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Disconnect-PnPOnline [-Connection <PnPConnection>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

>Note: in general it is not recommended nor needed to use this cmdlet.

Disconnects the current context and requires you to build up a new connection in order to use the Cmdlets again. Using Connect-PnPOnline to connect to a different site has the same effect and it's rarely needed to use Disconnect-PnPOnline. Notice that if you use Disconnect-PnPOnline the internal access token cache will be cleared too. This means that if you loop through many Connect-PnPOnline and subsequent Disconnect-PnPOnline statements a full request to the Azure AD is being made to acquire a token. This will cause throttling to occur and the script will stop. 

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```powershell
Disconnect-PnPOnline
```

This will clear out all active tokens
