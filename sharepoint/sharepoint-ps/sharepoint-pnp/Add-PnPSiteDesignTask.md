# Add-PnPSiteDesignTask

## SYNOPSIS
This command is used to apply a published site design to a specified site collection target. It schedules the operation, allowing for the application of larger site scripts (Invoke-PnPSiteDesign is limited to 30 actions and subactions).
This command is intended to replace Invoke-PnPSiteDesign and is useful when you need to apply a large number of actions or multiple site scripts.

## SYNTAX 

```powershell
Add-PnPSiteDesignTask -SiteDesignId <GuidPipeBind>
                      [-WebUrl <String>]
                      [-Web <WebPipeBind>]
                      [-Connection <SPOnlineConnection>]
```
