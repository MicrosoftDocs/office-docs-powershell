# Receive-PnPCopyMoveJobStatus

## SYNOPSIS

> [!TIP]
> We encourage you to make improvements to this documentation. Please navigate to https://github.com/pnp/powershell/blob/dev/documentation/Receive-PnPCopyMoveJobStatus.md to change this file.

This cmdlets receives Copy or Move job status which is being returned by Copy-PnPFile or Move-PnPFile when using the -NoWait parameter

## SYNTAX

```
Receive-PnPCopyMoveJobStatus -Job <CopyMigrationInfo> [-Wait]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlets outputs the results of a pending/finished copy or move job.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
$job = Copy-PnPFile -SourceUrl "Shared Documents/company.docx" -TargetUrl "SubSite2/Shared Documents" -NoWait
$jobStatus = Receive-PnPCopyMoveJobStatus -Job $result
if($jobStatus.JobState == 0)
{
  Write-Host "Job finished"
}
```
