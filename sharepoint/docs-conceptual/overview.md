# Overview

Microsoft PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language that provides an administrator full access to applicable application programming interfaces (APIs). Administrators can interact directly with SharePoint Server to manipulate web applications, site collections, sites, lists and much more. In addition, an administrator can script cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets").

By default,  Powershell is located at the following path:  <%SystemRoot%>\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\PowerShell.exe.

PowerShell can be used by authorized admins to perform a wide variety of tasks in SharePoint on-premises and SharePoint Online. Microsoft provides the cmdlets used for these 2 systems and the Patterns and Practices (PnP) group has created an additional set of modules that provide many additional capabilities.

For a list of SharePoint Server on-premises cmdlets, see [SharePoint Server cmdlets](sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets.md)

For a list of SharePoint Online cmdlets, see [SharePoint Online cmdlets](sharepoint-online/sharepoint-online-cmdlets.md)

For a list of the SharePoint PnP cmdlets, see [SharePoint PnP cmdlets](sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets.md)

## SharePoint Online

Verify that you have the following administrative permissions:

* You must be assigned SharePoint administrator role.
