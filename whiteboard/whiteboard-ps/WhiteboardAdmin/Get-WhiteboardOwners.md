# Get-WhiteboardOwners

## SYNOPSIS
Gets all the users in a tenant who own whiteboards in a specified geography.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-WhiteboardOwners [-Geography] <String> [[-ContinuationToken] <String>] [-ForceAuthPrompt]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Gets all the users in a tenant who own whiteboards in a specified geography. Returns them as an
object containing a list of user object, a tenantId and a continuation token. By calling repeatedly
passing in the new continuation tokens, all the owners for a tenant can be gathered. The data
returned is precalculated and therefore not realtime. Results are precalculated approximately every
two weeks.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

Get the owners in the European geography.

```powershell
PS C:\>Get-WhiteboardOwners -Geography Europe
```

```Output
TenantId:                  tenantId
Geography:                 The geography queried for
Items:                     List of user ids
ContinuationToken:         continuation token
```

## PARAMETERS

(Optional) A continuation token based on the last time this function was called. Due to the large
volume of boards in a tenant, results are returned in chunks at a time, with a continuation token to
signify where to pick up from. To start from the beginning, pass in null.
