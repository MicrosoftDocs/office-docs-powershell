description: |-
  Gets all the users in a tenant who own whiteboards in a specified geography. Returns them as an object containing a list of user object, a tenantId and a continuation token. By calling repeatedly passing in the new continuation tokens, all the owners for a tenant can be gathered. The data returned is precalculated and therefore not realtime. Results are precalculated approximately every two weeks.
