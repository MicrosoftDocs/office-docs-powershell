# Microsoft Teams cmdlet help reference

Welcome to the Microsoft Teams PowerShell cmdlet **Help** reference. Cmdlets for managing Microsoft Teams service are split between two powershell modules: the Skype for Business Online and the Microsoft Teams.

This PowerShell module is used for provisioning and management of teams and their backing groups themselves. The module can be installed here: <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams/>. To manage the policies and configurations that apply to the Microsoft Teams service, please see the reference documents for the Skype for Business module: <https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype>.

Here, you will find all of the Microsoft Teams PowerShell **Help** topics. These topics are 'open source' and open for contributions. If you are interested in contributing to this content, go to the source GitHub repo and look through the README.

The repo is located here: <https://github.com/microsoftdocs/office-docs-powershell> and you can find the README displayed at the bottom of the page.
