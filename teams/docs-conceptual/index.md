# Microsoft Teams cmdlet help reference

Welcome to the Microsoft Teams PowerShell cmdlet **Help** reference.

This PowerShell module is used for provisioning and management of teams and their backing groups themselves. The module can be installed here: <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams/>.
