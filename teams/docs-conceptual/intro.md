#Microsoft Teams cmdlet reference

Welcome to the Microsoft Teams PowerShell cmdlet help references. Cmdlets for managing Microsoft Teams service are split between two powershell modules: the Skype for Business Online module and the Microsoft Teams module.

This powershell module is used for provisioning and management of teams and their backing groups themselves.  The module is currently in Beta and can be installed here: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams/ .  To manage the policies and configurations that apply to the Microsoft Teams service, please see the reference docs for the Skype for Business module: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/?view=skype-ps 

Here you will find all of the Microsoft Teams PowerShell help topics. These topics are 'open source' and open for contributions. If you are interested in contributing to this content head over to the source GitHub repo and look through the README. 

The repo is located here: https://github.com/microsoftdocs/office-docs-powershell and you can find the README displayed at the bottom of the page.
