# New-CsTeamsRecordingAndTranscriptionLocalizationCustomMessage

### -AutomaticallyStartCopilot
> [!NOTE]
> This feature has not been fully released yet, so the setting will have no effect.

## SYNOPSIS
Create a set of language-specific prompt messages to be displayed to participants after recording or transcription has started. 


## SYNTAX

```
New-CsTeamsRecordingAndTranscriptionLocalizationCustomMessage -Language <String>
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

The strings defined by this command is used for display after recording or transcription is started in a meeting. Based on the different scenarios when recording or transcription is enabled, we provide different keys for customization, as detailed below.
These strings will not take effect immediately after being created; they need to be associated with other configurations and policies.


| key name | description |
| ---------|-------------|
| initiatorImplicit | User is recording/transcription initiator, recording/transcription consent policy is off for the organizer.|
| ParticipantImplicit | Others in meeting/calling turns on the recording or transcription, recording/transcription consent policy is off for the organizer.|
| initiatorExplicit | User is recording/transcription initiator, recording/transcription consent policy is on for the organizer.|
| ParticipantExplicitRequested | Others in meeting/calling turns on the recording or transcription, recording/transcription consent policy is on for the organizer. Current consent state is "required the attendee to give the consent to recording and transcription"|
| ParticipantExplicitProvided | Others in meeting/calling turns on the recording or transcription, recording/transcription consent policy is on for the organizer. Current consent state is "attendee has given the consent to recording and transcription"|
| agreementDialogue | Others in meeting/calling turns on the recording or transcription, recording/transcription consent policy is on for the organizer. User clicks the mute/share screen/turn on camera, then a confirm dialog will show to the user.|

In most cases, we directly use the custom string to overwrite the original string content. For example, under normal circumstances, when the meeting organizer starts recording, the prompt shown to regular participants is "Started by XXX. By attending this meeting, you agree to being included." If you set the ParticipantImplicit string to "This meeting will be recorded." and successfully apply it to the organizer, then regular participants will see: "Started by XXX. This meeting will be recorded."

However, ParticipantExplicitRequested and agreementDialogue are handled differently. Their original content contains instructional information, so we retain the original content and append the custom content after it.

Note that this cmdlet is only used in conjunction with New-CsTeamsRecordingAndTranscriptionCustomMessage and Set-CsTeamsRecordingAndTranscriptionCustomMessage to create associations between messages in multiple languages. 
Please refer to the documentation of CsTeamsRecordingAndTranscriptionCustomMessage cmdlets for examples and further information.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> New-CsTeamsRecordingAndTranscriptionLocalizationCustomMessage -Language "en-US" -InitiatorImplicit "This call is being recorded." -ParticipantImplicit "This call is being recorded."
```
The command shown in Example 1 created a new set of custom message in en-US, it defined 2 scenarios, InitiatorImplicit and ParticipantImplicit.

### Example 2
```powershell
PS C:\> New-CsTeamsRecordingAndTranscriptionLocalizationCustomMessage -Language "en-US" -initiatorExplicit "<empty>" -ParticipantExplicitProvided "<empty>" 
```
 **<empty>** is a keyword for clean the default message. The command shown in Example 2 will create a void message to override the default message of initiatorExplicit and ParticipantExplicitProvided scenarios.


## PARAMETERS

### -Language
Define language of the message set. In a meeting, if the organizer has applied a custom message, all participants will use the organizerâ€™s policy. If meeting participants are from different countries and regions, then when recording or transcription is enabled, the prompt content depends on whether the organizer has customized the message for the language currently used by each participant. For example, if A is the meeting organizer and the policy applied to A defines messages in English and French, and B, C, and D use English, Chinese, and French as their Teams languages respectively, then B and D will see the customized prompt, while C will only see the default prompt.

### -initiatorImplicit
With **-ParticipantImplicit**,**-initiatorExplicit**,**-ParticipantExplicitRequested**,**-ParticipantExplicitProvided**,**-agreementDialogue**, as mentioned on above tables, they represent different user scenarios.
