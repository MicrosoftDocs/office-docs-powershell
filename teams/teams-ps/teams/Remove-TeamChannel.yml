### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Delete a channel.
  This will not delete content in associated tabs.

  Note: The channel will be "soft deleted", meaning the contents are not permanently deleted for a time. 
  So a subsequent call to Add-TeamChannel using the same channel name will fail if enough time has not passed.
