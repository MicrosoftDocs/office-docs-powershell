  code: |-
    Get-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy -Filter "tag:*" | Remove-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy
  description: |-
    In Example 2, all Teams voice applications policies configured at the per-user scope are removed. To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy cmdlet along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "tag:*" limits the returned data to Teams voice applications policies configured at the per-user scope. Those per-user policies are then piped to and removed by the Remove-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy cmdlet.
