# New-CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

The CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy controls roll out of the change that governs the storage for meeting recordings. 

## SYNTAX

```
New-CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy [-MeetingRecordingOwnership <String>] [-Identity] <String> [-Force] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy controls roll out of the change that governs the storage for meeting recordings. This policy would be deprecated over time as this is only to allow IT admins to phase the roll out of this breaking change.

The New-CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy cmdlet allows administrators to define new CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy that can be assigned to particular users to control Teams features related to meetings.

This command is available from Teams powershell module 6.1.1-preview and above.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> New-CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy -Identity OrganizerPolicy -MeetingRecordingOwnership MeetingOrganizer
```

The command shown in Example 1 uses the New-CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy cmdlet to create a new TeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy with the Identity OrganizerPolicy.
This policy will set MeetingRecordingOwnership to MeetingOrganizer. Recordings for this policy group's users as organizer would get saved to organizers' own OneDrive.
