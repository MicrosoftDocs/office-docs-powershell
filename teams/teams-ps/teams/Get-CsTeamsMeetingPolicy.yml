  code: |-
    Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy | Where-Object {$_.AllowMeetNow -eq $True}
  description: |-
    The preceding command returns a collection of all the meeting policies where the AllowMeetNow property is True.
    To do this, Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy is first called without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the policies configured for use in the organization.
    This collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only those policies where the AllowMeetNow property is equal to True.
