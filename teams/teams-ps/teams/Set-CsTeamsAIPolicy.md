# Set-CsTeamsAIPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

This cmdlet Set Teams AI policy value for current tenant.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-CsTeamsAIPolicy [[-Identity] <string>]
 [-EnrollFace <Boolean>]
 [-EnrollVoice <Boolean>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The new csTeamsAIPolicy will replace the existing enrollment settings in csTeamsMeetingPolicy, providing enhanced flexibility and control for Teams meeting administrators. Unlike the current single setting, EnrollUserOverride, which applies to both face and voice enrollment, the new policy introduces two distinct settings: EnrollFace and EnrollVoice. These can be individually set to Enabled or Disabled, offering more granular control over biometric enrollments. In addition to improving the management of face and voice data, the csTeamsAIPolicy is designed to support future AI-related settings in Teams, making it a scalable solution for evolving needs.

This cmdlet sets the Teams AI policy EnrollFace and EnrollVoice value for the tenant. The values of EnrollFace and EnrollVoice can be set to "Enabled" or "Disabled".
