# Set-CsTeamsAIPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

This cmdlet sets Teams AI policy value for users in the tenant.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsAIPolicy [[-Identity] <string>]
 [-EnrollFace <string>]
 [-EnrollVoice <string>]
 [-SpeakerAttributionBYOD <string>]
 [-Description <string>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The new csTeamsAIPolicy will replace the existing enrollment settings in csTeamsMeetingPolicy, providing enhanced flexibility and control for Teams meeting administrators. Unlike the current single setting, EnrollUserOverride, which applies to both face and voice enrollment, the new policy introduces two distinct settings: EnrollFace and EnrollVoice. These can be individually set to Enabled or Disabled, offering more granular control over biometric enrollments. A new setting, SpeakerAttributionBYOD, is also being added to csTeamsAIPolicy. This allows IT admins to turn off speaker attribution in BYOD scenarios, giving them greater control over how voice data is managed in such environments. This setting can be set to Enabled or Disabled, and will be Enabled by default. In addition to improving the management of face and voice data, the csTeamsAIPolicy is designed to support future AI-related settings in Teams, making it a scalable solution for evolving needs.

This cmdlet sets the EnrollFace, EnrollVoice, and SpeakerAttributionBYOD values within the csTeamsAIPolicy. These policies can be assigned to users, and each setting can be configured as "Enabled" or "Disabled". "
