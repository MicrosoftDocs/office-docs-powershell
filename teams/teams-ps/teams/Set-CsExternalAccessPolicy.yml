### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Enables you to modify the properties of an existing external access policy.
  External access policies determine whether or not your users can: 1) communicate with users who have Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) accounts with a federated organization; 2) communicate with users who are using custom applications built with [Azure Communication Services](/azure/communication-services/concepts/teams-interop); 3) access Skype for Business Server over the Internet, without having to log on to your internal network; 4) communicate with users who have SIP accounts with a public instant messaging (IM) provider such as Skype; and, 5) communicate with people who are using Teams with an account that's not managed by an organization.

  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.
module: MicrosoftTeamsPowerShell

    The `Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet does not return a value or object.

examples:
- title: '-------------------------- Example 1 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy -Identity RedmondExternalAccessPolicy -EnableFederationAccess $True
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 modifies the per-user external access policy that has the Identity RedmondExternalAccessPolicy.
    In this example, the command changes the value of the EnableFederationAccess property to True.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsExternalAccessPolicy | Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy -EnableFederationAccess $True
  description: |-
    In Example 2, federation access is enabled for all the external access policies configured for use in the organization.
    To do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet without any parameters; this returns a collection of all the external policies currently configured for use.
    That collection is then piped to the `Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet, which changes the value of the EnableFederationAccess property for each policy in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsExternalAccessPolicy -Filter tag:* | Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy -EnableFederationAccess $True
  description: |-
    Example 3 enables federation access for all the external access policies that have been configured at the per-user scope.
    To carry out this task, the first thing the command does is use the `Get-CsExternalAcessPolicy` cmdlet and the Filter parameter to return a collection of all the policies that have been configured at the per-user scope.
    (The filter value "tag:*" limits returned data to policies that have an Identity that begins with the string value "tag:".
    Any policy with an Identity that begins with "tag:" has been configured at the per-user scope.) The filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet, which modifies the EnableFederationAccess property for each policy in the collection.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 4 ------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsExternalAccessPolicy | Where-Object {$_.EnablePublicCloudAccess -eq $True} | Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy -EnableFederationAccess $True
  description: |-
    In Example 4, federation access is enabled for all the external access policies that allow public cloud access.
    To do this, the command first uses the `Get-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet to return a collection of all the external access policies currently configured for use in the organization.
    This collection is piped to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which picks out only those policies where the EnablePublicCloudAccess property is equal to True.
    The filtered collection is then piped to the `Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet, which takes each policy and sets the EnableFederationAccess property to True.
    The net result: all external access policies that allow public cloud access will also allow federation access.

  code: |-
    Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy -Identity Global -EnableAcsFederationAccess $false
    New-CsExternalAccessPolicy -Identity AcsFederationAllowed -EnableAcsFederationAccess $true
  description: |-
    In this example, the Global policy is updated to disallow Teams-ACS federation for all users, then a new external access policy instance is created with Teams-ACS federation enabled and which can be assigned to selected users for which Team-ACS federation will be allowed.

description: |-
  When you install Skype for Business Server your users are only allowed to exchange instant messages and presence information among themselves: by default, they can only communicate with people who have SIP accounts in your Active Directory Domain Services.
  In addition, users are not allowed to access Skype for Business Server over the Internet; instead, they must be logged on to your internal network before they will be able to log on to Skype for Business Server.

  That might be sufficient to meet your communication needs.
  If it doesn't meet your needs, you can use external access policies to extend the ability of your users to communicate and collaborate.
  External access policies can grant (or revoke) the ability of your users to do any or all of the following:

  1. Communicate with people who have SIP accounts with a federated organization.
  Note that enabling federation alone will not provide users with this capability.
  Instead, you must enable federation and then assign users an external access policy that gives them the right to communicate with federated users.

  2. (Microsoft Teams only) Communicate with users who are using custom applications built with [Azure Communication Services (ACS)](/azure/communication-services/concepts/teams-interop). This policy setting only applies if ACS federation has been enabled at the tenant level using the cmdlet [Set-CsTeamsAcsFederationConfiguration](Set-CsTeamsAcsFederationConfiguration.yml).

  3. Access Skype for Business Server over the Internet, without having to first log on to your internal network.
  This enables your users to use Skype for Business and log on to Skype for Business Server from an Internet café or other remote location.

  4. Communicate with people who have SIP accounts with a public instant messaging service such as Skype.

     The following parameters are not applicable to Skype for Business Online/Microsoft Teams: Description, EnableXmppAccess, Force, Identity, Instance, PipelineVariable, and Tenant

  5. (Microsoft Teams Only) Communicate with people who are using Teams with an account that's not managed by an organization. This policy only applies if Teams Consumer Federation has been enabled at the tenant level using the cmdlet [Set-CsTenantFederationConfiguration](Set-CsTeamsAcsFederationConfiguration.yml) or Teams admin center under the External Access setting.

  After an external access policy has been created, you can use the `Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet to change the property values of that policy.
  For example, by default the global policy does not allow users to communicate with people who have accounts with a federated organization.
  If you would like to grant this capability to all of your users you can call the `Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy` cmdlet and set the value of the global policy's EnableFederationAccess property to True.
