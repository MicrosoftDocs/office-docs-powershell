parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Archived
  description: |+
    If $true, filters to return teams that have been archived.  If $false, filters to return teams that have not been archived.  Do not specify any value to return teams that match filter regardless of archived state.  This is a filter rather than an exact match.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisplayName
  description: |+
    Specify this parameter to return teams with the provided display name as a filter.  As the display name is not unique, multiple values can be returned. Note that this filter value is case-sensitive.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GroupId
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specify the specific GroupId (as a string) of the team to be returned.  This is a unique identifier and returns exact match.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MailNickName
  description: |+
    Specify the mailnickname of the team that is being returned. This acts as a filter instead of being an exact match.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NumberOfThreads
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of threads to use. If you have sufficient network bandwidth and want to decrease the time required to retrieve the list of teams, use the -NumberOfThreads parameter, which supports a value from 1 through 20.

  defaultValue: "20"
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: User
  description: |+
    User's UPN (user principal name - e.g.
    johndoe@example.com)

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Visibility
  description: |+
    Filters to return teams with a set "visibility" value.  Accepted values are "Public", "Private" or "HiddenMembership".  Do not specify any value to return teams that match filter regardless of visibility.  This is a filter rather than an exact match.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""

  > [!NOTE]
  > Get-Team may return multiple results matching the input and not just the exact match for attributes like DisplayName/MailNickName. This is known behavior.
