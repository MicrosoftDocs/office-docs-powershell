### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Tests a telephone number against a voice normalization rule and returns the number after the normalization rule has been applied.
  Voice normalization rules are typically used to convert a telephone dialing requirement (for example, you must dial 9 to access an outside line) to the E.164 phone
  number format.
  This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

    Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Policy.Voice.NormalizationRule object.
    Accepts pipelined input of voice normalization rule objects.

    Returns an object of type Microsoft.Rtc.Management.Voice.NormalizationRuleTestResult.

  code: |-
    Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity "global/11 digit number rule" | Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber 14255559999
  description: |-
    For Lync or Skype for Business Server, this example runs a voice normalization test against the voice normalization rule with the Identity "global/11 digit number rule".
    First the `Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet is run to retrieve the rule with the Identity "global/11 digit number rule".
    That rule object is then piped to the `Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet, where the rule is tested against the telephone number 14255559999.
    The output will be the DialedNumber after the voice normalization rule "global/11 digit number rule" has been applied.
    If this rule does not apply to the DialedNumber value (for example, if the normalization rule matches the pattern for an 11-digit number and you supply a 7-digit number) no value will be returned.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    $a = Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity "global/11 digit number rule"
    Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber 5551212 -NormalizationRule $a
  description: |-
    For Lync or Skype for Business Server, example 2 is identical to Example 1 except that instead of piping the results of the Get operation directly to the Test cmdlet, the
    object is first stored in the variable $a and then is passed as the value to the parameter NormalizationRule to be used as the voice normalization rule against which the
    test will run.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule | Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber 2065559999
  description: |-
    For Lync or Skype for Business Server, this example runs a voice normalization test against all voice normalization rules defined within the Skype for Business
    Server deployment. First the `Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet is run (with no parameters) to retrieve all the voice normalization rules.
    The collection of rules that is returned is then piped to the `Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet, where each rule in the collection is tested against the telephone
    number 2065559999. The output will be a list of translated numbers, one for each rule tested.
    If a rule does not apply to the DialedNumber value (for example, if the normalization rule matches the pattern for an 11-digit number and you supply a 7-digit number) there
    will be a blank line in the list for that rule.

  description: |-
    For Microsoft Teams, this example gets all the normalization rules in the tenant dial plan DP1, shows the first of these rules, and then test that rule on the
    dialed number 1234. The output shows that the rule normalize the dialed number to +12065551234.

description: |-
  This cmdlet allows you to see the results of applying a voice normalization rule to a given telephone number.
  Voice normalization rules are a required part of phone authorization and call routing.
  They define the requirements for converting--or translating-- numbers from a format typically entered by users to a standard (E.164) format.
  Use this cmdlet to troubleshoot dialing issues or to verify that rules will work as expected against given numbers.
