description: |-
  External trusted IPs are the Internet external IPs of the enterprise network and are used to determine if the user's endpoint is inside the corporate network before checking for a specific site match. Trusted IP addresses in both IPv4 and IPv6 formats are accepted.

  If the user's external IP matches one defined in the trusted list, then Location-Based Routing will check to determine which internal subnet the user's endpoint is located. If the user's external IP doesn't match one defined in the trusted list, the endpoint will be classified as being at an unknown and any PSTN calls to/from an LBR enabled user are blocked.

  Location Based Routing is a feature which allows PSTN toll bypass to be restricted for users based upon policy and the user's geographic location at the time of an incoming or outgoing PSTN call. 

  Location-Based Routing leverages the same network regions, sites, and subnets concept that is available in Skype for Business Server. It is now available in O365 for Teams clients. For toll bypass restricted locations, each IP subnet and PSTN gateway for that location are associated to a network site by the administrator. A user's location is determined by the IP subnet which the user's Teams endpoint(s) is connected to at the time of a PSTN call. A user may have multiple Teams clients located at different sites, in which case Location-Based Routing will enforce each client's routing separately depending on the location of its endpoint.
