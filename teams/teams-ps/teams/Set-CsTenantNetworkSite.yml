description: |-
  A network site represents a location where your organization has a physical venue, such as offices, a set of buildings, or a campus. Network sites are defined as a collection of IP subnets. Each network site must be associated with a network region.

  A best practice for Location Based Routing (LBR) is to create a separate site for each location which has unique PSTN connectivity. Sites may be created as LBR or non-LBR enabled. A non-LBR enabled site may be created to allow LBR enabled users to make PSTN calls when they roam to that site. Note that network sites may also be used for emergency calling enablement and configuration. In addition, network sites can also be used for configuring Network Roaming Policy capabilities.
