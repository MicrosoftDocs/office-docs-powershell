  This cmdlet assigns a policy package to a group in a tenant. The available policy packages and their definitions can be found by running Get-CsPolicyPackage. For more information on policy packages, please review [Manage policy packages in Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-policy-packages).

  Policy rankings can be optionally specified for each policy type in the package to determine which policies will be assigned to the user in case they belong to two or more groups. If policy rankings for a policy type is not specified, one of two things can happen:

  - If the policy type was previously assigned to the group, the ranking for the policy type will not change.
  - If the policy type was not previously assigned to the group, the ranking for the policy type will be ranked last.

  Finally, if a user was directly assigned a package, direct assignment takes precedence over group assignment. For more information on policy rankings and group policy assignments, please review [the description section under New-CsGroupPolicyAssignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/teams/new-csgrouppolicyassignment#description).
