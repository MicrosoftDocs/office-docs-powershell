### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet tests a phone number against the configured number manipulation rules and returns information about the matching rule.
module: MicrosoftTeamsPowerShell
notes: |-
  The cmdlet is available in Teams PowerShell Module 4.5.0 or later.

  The matching logic used in the cmdlet is the same as when the manipulation rule has been associated with an SBC and a call is being routed.

  If a match is found in two or more manipulation rules, the first one is returned.

  There is a short delay before newly created manipulation rules are added to the evaluation.
