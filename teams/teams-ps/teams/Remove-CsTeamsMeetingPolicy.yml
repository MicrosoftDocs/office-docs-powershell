  name: Identity
  description: |+
    Unique identifier for the teams meeting policy to be removed. To remove the global policy, use this syntax: -Identity global. (Note that the global policy cannot actually be removed. Instead, all the policy properties will be reset to their default values.) To remove a custom policy, use this syntax: -Identity StudentMeetingPolicy.

  description: |+
    Globally unique identifier (GUID) of the tenant account whose external user communication policy are being created. For example:

    -Tenant "38aad667-af54-4397-aaa7-e94c79ec2308"

    You can return your tenant ID by running this command:

    Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID

    If you are using a remote session of Windows PowerShell and are connected only to Skype for Business Online you do not have to include the Tenant parameter. Instead, the tenant ID will automatically be filled in for you based on your connection information. The Tenant parameter is primarily for use in a hybrid deployment.

description: |-
  Deletes a previously created TeamsMeetingPolicy. Any users with no explicitly assigned policies will then fall back to the default policy in the organization. You cannot delete the global policy from the organization. If you want to remove policies currently assigned to one or more users, you should assign a different policy to them before.
