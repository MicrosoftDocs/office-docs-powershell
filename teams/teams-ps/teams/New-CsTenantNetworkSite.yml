examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-CsTenantNetworkSite -NetworkSiteID "MicrosoftSite1" -NetworkRegionID "RegionRedmond"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 created the network site 'MicrosoftSite1' with no description. Identity will be set identical with NetworkSiteID.

    The network region 'RegionRedmond' is created beforehand and 'MicrosoftSite1' will be associated with 'RegionRedmond'.

    NetworkSites can exist without all parameters excepts NetworkSiteID. NetworkRegionID can be left blank.

- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-CsTenantNetworkSite -NetworkSiteID "site2" -Description "site 2" -NetworkRegionID "RedmondRegion" -LocationPolicy "TestLocationPolicy" -EnableLocationBasedRouting $true
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 2 creates the network site 'site2' with the description 'site 2'. This site is enabled for LBR, and associates with network region 'RedmondRegion' and with location policy 'TestLocationPolicy'.

- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-CsTenantNetworkSite -NetworkSiteID "site3" -Description "site 3" -NetworkRegionID "RedmondRegion" -NetworkRoamingPolicy "TestNetworkRoamingPolicy"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 3 creates the network site 'site3' with the description 'site 3'. This site is enabled for network roaming capabilities. The example associates the site with network region 'RedmondRegion' and network roaming policy 'TestNetworkRoamingPolicy'.

description: |-
  A network site represents a location where your organization has a physical venue, such as offices, a set of buildings, or a campus. Network sites are defined as a collection of IP subnets. Each network site must be associated with a network region.

  A best practice for Location Based Routing (LBR) is to create a separate site for each location which has unique PSTN connectivity. Sites may be created as LBR or non-LBR enabled. A non-LBR enabled site may be created to allow LBR enabled users to make PSTN calls when they roam to that site. Note that network sites may also be used for emergency calling enablement and configuration. In addition, network sites can also be used for configuring Network Roaming Policy capabilities.
