    PS C:\ Get-CsOnlineVoiceRoute -Filter *Redmond* | Remove-CsOnlineVoiceRoute
  description: |-
    This command removes all online voice routes with an identity that includes the string "Redmond". First the `Get-CsOnlineVoiceRoute` cmdlet is called with the Filter parameter. The value of the Filter parameter is the string Redmond surrounded by wildcard characters (\*), which specifies that the string can be anywhere within the Identity. After all of the online voice routes with identities that include the string Redmond are retrieved, these online voice routes are piped to the `Remove-CsOnlineVoiceRoute` cmdlet, which removes each one.

description: |-
  Use this cmdlet to remove an existing online voice route. Online voice routes are associated with online voice policies through online PSTN usages, so removing an online voice route does not change any values relating to an online voice policy, it simply changes the routing for the numbers that had matched the pattern for the deleted online voice route.

  This cmdlet is used when configuring Microsoft Phone System Direct Routing.
