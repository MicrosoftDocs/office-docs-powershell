# Remove-CsTeamsVdiPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
This CsTeamsVdiPolicy cmdlets removes a previously created TeamsVdiPolicy.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsTeamsVdiPolicy [-Identity] <String> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Deletes a previously created TeamsVdiPolicy. Any users with no explicitly assigned policies will then fall back to the default policy in the organization. You cannot delete the global policy from the organization. If you want to remove policies currently assigned to one or more users, you should assign a different policy to them before.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity RestrictedUserPolicy 
```

In the example shown above, the command will delete the restricted user policy from the organization's list of policies and remove all assignments of this policy from users who have had the policy assigned.

### -Force
