- title: EXAMPLE 2
  code: |-
    Get-CsTeamsSharedCallingRoutingPolicy -Filter "tag:*" | Remove-CsTeamsSharedCallingRoutingPolicy
  description: |-
    In Example 2, all Teams shared calling routing policies configured at the per-user scope are removed. To do this, the command first
    calls the Get-CsTeamsSharedCallingRoutingPolicy cmdlet along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "tag:*" limits the
    returned data to Teams shared calling routing policies configured at the per-user scope. Those per-user policies are then piped to
    and removed by the Remove-CsTeamsSharedCallingRoutingPolicy cmdlet.
