examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy -Identity 'ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy' -ComplianceRecordingApplications @(New-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingApplication -Parent 'ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy' -Id 'd93fefc7-93cc-4d44-9a5d-344b0fff2899')
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 modifies an existing per-user Teams recording policy with the Identity ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy.
    This policy is re-assigned a single application instance of a policy-based recording application: d93fefc7-93cc-4d44-9a5d-344b0fff2899, which is the ObjectId of the application instance as obtained from the Get-CsOnlineApplicationInstance cmdlet.

    Any Microsoft Teams users who are assigned this policy will have their calls and meetings recorded by that application instance. Existing calls and meetings are unaffected.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy -Identity 'ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy' -ComplianceRecordingApplications @(New-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingApplication -Parent 'ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy' -Id 'd93fefc7-93cc-4d44-9a5d-344b0fff2899'), @(New-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingApplication -Parent 'ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy' -Id '39dc3ede-c80e-4f19-9153-417a65a1f144')
  description: |-
    Example 2 is a variation of Example 1.
    In this case, the Teams recording policy is re-assigned two application instances of policy-based recording applications.

    Any Microsoft Teams users who are assigned this policy will have their calls and meetings recorded by both those application instances. Existing calls and meetings are unaffected.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy -Identity 'ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy' -Enabled $false
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 3 stops automatic policy-based recording for all new calls and meetings of all Microsoft Teams users who are assigned this policy. Existing calls and meetings are unaffected.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 4
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy -Identity 'ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy' -Enabled $true
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 4 causes automatic policy-based recording to occur for all new calls and meetings of all Microsoft Teams users who are assigned this policy. Existing calls and meetings are unaffected.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 5
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy | Set-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy -Enabled $false
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 5 stops automatic policy-based recording for all Teams recording policies.
    This effectively stops automatic policy-based recording for all new calls and meetings of all Microsoft Teams users who are assigned any Teams recording policy. Existing calls and meetings are unaffected.

description: |-
  Teams recording policies are used in automatic policy-based recording scenarios.
  When Microsoft Teams users participate in meetings or make or receive calls, the policy-based recording applications i.e. bots associated with the user's Teams recording policy are invited into the call or meeting to record audio, video and video-based screen sharing activity.

  Note that simply assigning a Teams recording policy to a Microsoft Teams user will not activate automatic policy-based recording for all Microsoft Teams calls and meetings that the user participates in.
  Among other things, you will need to create an application instance of a policy-based recording application i.e. a bot in your tenant and will then need to assign an appropriate policy to the user.

  Please work with your Microsoft certified policy-based recording application provider to obtain an instance of their recording application.
  Please refer to the documentation of the CsOnlineApplicationInstance cmdlets for information on how to create an application instance of a policy-based recording application.

  Assigning your Microsoft Teams users a Teams recording policy activates automatic policy-based recording for all new Microsoft Teams calls and meetings that the users participate in.
  The system will load the recording application and join it to appropriate calls and meetings in order for it to enforce compliance with the administrative set policy.
  Existing calls and meetings are unaffected.
