  name: Filter

    Enables you to use wildcards when specifying the policy (or policies) to be retrieved. For example, this syntax returns all the policies that have been configured at the site scope: -Filter "site:". This syntax returns all the policies that have been configured at the per-user scope: -Filter "tag:".
    You cannot use both the Filter and the Identity parameters in the same command.

    Unique identifier for the policy to be returned. To return the global policy, use this syntax: -Identity global. To return a policy configured at the site scope, use syntax similar to this: -Identity "site:Redmond". To return a policy configured at the service scope, use syntax similar to this: -Identity "Registrar:atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com". 

    Policies can also be configured at the per-user scope. To return one of these policies, use syntax similar to this: -Identity "SalesDepartmentPolicy".
    If this parameter is not included then all of Cortana voice assistant policies configured for use in your organization will be returned.
