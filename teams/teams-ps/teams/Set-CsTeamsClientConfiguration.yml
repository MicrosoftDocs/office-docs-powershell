description: |-
  The TeamsClientConfiguration allows IT admins to control the settings that can be accessed via Teams clients across their organization.  This configuration includes settings like which third party cloud storage your organization allows, whether or not guest users can access the teams client, and whether or not meeting room devices running teams are can display content from user accounts.  The parameter descriptions below describe what settings are managed by this configuration and how they are enforced. 

  An organization can have only one effective Teams Client Configuration - these settings will apply across the entire organization for the particular features they control.  

  Note that three of these settings (ContentPin, ResourceAccountContentAccess, and AllowResourceAccountSendMessage) control resource account behavior for Surface Hub devices attending Skype for Business meetings, and are not used in Microsoft Teams.
