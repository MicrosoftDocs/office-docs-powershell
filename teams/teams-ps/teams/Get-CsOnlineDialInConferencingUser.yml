  name: Identity
  description: |+
    Specifies the user to retrieve.
    The user can be specified by using one of four formats: 1) the user's SIP address; 2) the user's user principal name (UPN); 3) the user's domain name and logon name, in the form domain\logon (for example, litwareinc\kenmyer); and, 4) the user's Active Directory display name (for example, Ken Myer).
    You can also reference a user account by using the user's Active Directory distinguished name.

  name: LdapFilter
  description: |+
    *This parameter has been deprecated from Teams PowerShell Modules 3.0 and above due to limited usage*.

    Enables you to limit the returned data by filtering on generic Active Directory attributes (that is, attributes that are not specific to Skype for Business Server 2015).
    For example, you can limit returned data to users who work in a specific department, or users who have a specified manager or job title.
    The LdapFilter parameter uses the LDAP query language when creating filters.
    For example, a filter that returns only users who work in the city of Redmond would look like this: "l=Redmond", with "l" (a lowercase L) representing the Active Directory attribute (locality); "=" representing the comparison operator (equal to); and "Redmond" representing the filter value.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ResultSize
  description: |+
    Enables you to limit the number of records returned by the cmdlet.
    For example, to return seven users (regardless of the number of users that are in your forest) include the ResultSize parameter and set the parameter value to 7.
    Note that there is no way to guarantee which seven users will be returned.
    The result size can be set to any whole number between 0 and 2147483647, inclusive.
    If set to 0 the command will run, but no data will be returned.
    If you set the ResultSize to 7 but you have only three users in your forest, the command will return those three users, and then complete without error.

  description: |+
    *This parameter has been deprecated from Teams PowerShell Modules 3.0 and above due to limited usage*.

    Specifies a service number to serve as a filter for the returned user collection.
    Only users who have been assigned the specified number will be returned.
    The service number can be specified in the following formats: E.164 number, +\<E.164 number\> and tel:\<E.164 number\>.

  defaultValue: None
