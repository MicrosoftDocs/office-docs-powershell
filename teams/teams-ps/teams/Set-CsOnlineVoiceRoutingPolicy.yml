examples:

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy" -OnlinePstnUsages @{Add="Long Distance"}
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 adds the online PSTN usage "Long Distance" to the per-user online voice routing policy RedmondOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy.

- title: '-------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity "RedmondOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy" -OnlinePstnUsages @{Remove="Local"}
  description: |-
    In Example 2, the online PSTN usage "Local" is removed from the per-user online voice routing policy RedmondOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy.
  summary: ""
- title: '-------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy | Where-Object {$_.OnlinePstnUsages -contains "Local"} | Set-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy -OnlinePstnUsages @{Remove="Local"}
  description: |-
    Example 3 removes the online PSTN usage "Local" from all the online voice routing policies that include that usage. In order to do this, the command first calls the `Get-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy` cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the available online voice routing policies. That collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those policies where the OnlinePstnUsages property includes (-contains) the "Local" usage. Those policies are then piped to the `Set-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy` cmdlet, which deletes the Local usage from each policy.

  Online voice routing policies are used in Microsoft Phone System Direct Routing scenarios. Assigning your Teams users an online voice routing policy enables those users to receive and to place phone calls to the public switched telephone network by using your on-premises SIP trunks.

  Note that simply assigning a user an online voice routing policy will not enable them to make PSTN calls via Teams. Among other things, you will also need to enable those users for Phone System and will need to assign them an appropriate online voice policy.
