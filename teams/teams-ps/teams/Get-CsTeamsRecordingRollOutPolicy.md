# Get-CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

The CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy controls roll out of the change that governs the storage for meeting recordings. 

## SYNTAX

### Filter

## DESCRIPTION

The CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy controls roll out of the change that governs the storage for meeting recordings. This policy would be deprecated over time as this is only to allow IT admins to phase the roll out of this breaking change.

The Get-CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy cmdlet enables you to return information about all the CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy that have been configured for use in your organization.

This command is available from Teams powershell module 6.1.1-preview and above.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy
```

In Example 1, Get-CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy is called without any additional parameters; this returns a collection of all the CsTeamsRecordingRollOutPolicy configured for use in your organization.
