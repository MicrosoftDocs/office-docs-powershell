summary: |-
  The TeamsCallParkPolicy controls whether or not users are able to leverage the call park feature in Microsoft Teams.  Call park allows enterprise voice customers to place a call on hold and then perform a number of actions on that call: transfer to another department, retrieve via the same phone, or retrieve via a different Teams phone.  The New-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy cmdlet lets you create a new custom policy that can then be assigned to one or more specific users.

  NOTE: The call park feature currently available in desktop. mobile and web clients. Supported with TeamsOnly mode.
