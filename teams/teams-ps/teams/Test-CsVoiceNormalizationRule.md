# Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule

## SYNOPSIS
Tests a telephone number against a voice normalization rule and returns the number after the normalization rule has been applied.
Voice normalization rules are typically used to convert a telephone dialing requirement (for example, you must dial 9 to access an outside line) to the E.164 phone
number format.
This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.


## SYNTAX

```
Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber <PhoneNumber> -NormalizationRule <NormalizationRule>
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet allows you to see the results of applying a voice normalization rule to a given telephone number.
Voice normalization rules are a required part of phone authorization and call routing.
They define the requirements for converting--or translating-- numbers from a format typically entered by users to a standard (E.164) format.
Use this cmdlet to troubleshoot dialing issues or to verify that rules will work as expected against given numbers.


## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity "global/11 digit number rule" | Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber 14255559999
```

For Lync or Skype for Business Server, this example runs a voice normalization test against the voice normalization rule with the Identity "global/11 digit number rule".
First the `Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet is run to retrieve the rule with the Identity "global/11 digit number rule".
That rule object is then piped to the `Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet, where the rule is tested against the telephone number 14255559999.
The output will be the DialedNumber after the voice normalization rule "global/11 digit number rule" has been applied.
If this rule does not apply to the DialedNumber value (for example, if the normalization rule matches the pattern for an 11-digit number and you supply a 7-digit number) no value will be returned.


### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
$a = Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -Identity "global/11 digit number rule"
Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber 5551212 -NormalizationRule $a
```

For Lync or Skype for Business Server, example 2 is identical to Example 1 except that instead of piping the results of the Get operation directly to the Test cmdlet, the
object is first stored in the variable $a and then is passed as the value to the parameter NormalizationRule to be used as the voice normalization rule against which the
test will run.


### -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
```
Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule | Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber 2065559999
```

For Lync or Skype for Business Server, this example runs a voice normalization test against all voice normalization rules defined within the Skype for Business
Server deployment. First the `Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet is run (with no parameters) to retrieve all the voice normalization rules.
The collection of rules that is returned is then piped to the `Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet, where each rule in the collection is tested against the telephone
number 2065559999. The output will be a list of translated numbers, one for each rule tested.
If a rule does not apply to the DialedNumber value (for example, if the normalization rule matches the pattern for an 11-digit number and you supply a 7-digit number) there
will be a blank line in the list for that rule.

### -------------------------- Example 4 --------------------------
```powershell
$nr=(Get-CsTenantDialPlan -Identity dp1).NormalizationRules
$nr[0]
```
```output
Description         :
Pattern             : ^(\d{4})$
Translation         : +1206555$1
Name                : nr1
IsInternalExtension : False
```
```powershell
Test-CsVoiceNormalizationRule -DialedNumber 1234 -NormalizationRule $nr[0]
```
```output
TranslatedNumber
----------------
+12065551234
```

For Microsoft Teams, this example gets all the normalization rules in the tenant dial plan DP1, shows the first of these rules, and then test that rule on the
dialed number 1234. The output shows that the rule normalize the dialed number to +12065551234.


## PARAMETERS

### -DialedNumber
The phone number against which you want to test the normalization rule specified in the NormalizationRule parameter.

Full Data Type: Microsoft.Rtc.Management.Voice.PhoneNumber


```yaml
Type: PhoneNumber
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Applicable: Lync Server 2010, Lync Server 2013, Skype for Business Server 2015, Skype for Business Server 2019, Microsoft Teams

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NormalizationRule
An object containing a reference to the normalization rule against which you want to test the number specified in the DialedNumber parameter.

For Lync and Skype for Business Server, you can retrieve voice normalization rules by calling the `Get-CsVoiceNormalizationRule` cmdlet.
For Microsoft Teams, you can retrieve voice normalization rules by calling the `Get-CsTenantDialPlan` cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: NormalizationRule
