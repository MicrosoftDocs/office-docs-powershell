## SYNTAX

```
Set-CsTeamsUnassignedNumberTreatment [[-Identity] <string>] [-Description <string>] [-Pattern <string>] [-Target <string>] [-TargetType <string>]
 [-TreatmentPriority <int>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet changes a treatment for how calls to an unassigned number range should be routed.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
$RAObjectId = (Get-CsOnlineApplicationInstance -Identity aa2@contoso.com).ObjectId
Set-CsTeamsUnassignedNumberTreatment -Identity MainAA -Target $RAObjectId
```
This example changes the treatment MainAA to route the calls to the resource account aa2@contoso.com.

### Example 2
```powershell
$UserObjectId = (Get-CsOnlineUser -Identity user2@contoso.com).Identity
Set-CsTeamsUnassignedNumberTreatment -Identity User2PSTN -TargetType User -Target $UserObjectId
```
This example changes the treatment User2PSTN to route the calls to the user user2@contoso.com.

Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

Required: False
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Target

```yaml
Type: System.Guid
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

```

### -TreatmentPriority
The priority of the treatment. Used to distinguish identical patterns. The lower the priority the higher preference. The priority needs to be unique.

## INPUTS

### System.Object

## OUTPUTS

### System.Object

## NOTES
The cmdlet is available in Teams PS module 2.5.1 or later.

Both inbound calls to Microsoft Teams and outbound calls from Microsoft Teams will have the called number checked against the unassigned number range.

To route calls to unassigned Microsoft Calling Plan subscriber numbers, your tenant needs to have available Communications Credits.

To route calls to unassigned Microsoft Calling Plan service numbers, your tenant needs to have at least one Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account license.

If a specified pattern/range contains phone numbers that are assigned to a user or resource account in the tenant, calls to these phone numbers will be routed to 
the appropriate target and not routed to the specified unassigned number treatment. There are no other checks of the numbers in the range. If the range contains
a valid external phone number, outbound calls from Microsoft Teams to that phone number will be routed according to the treatment.
