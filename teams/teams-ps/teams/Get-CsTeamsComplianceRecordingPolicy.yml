examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 returns information for all the Teams recording policies configured for use in the tenant.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy -Identity 'ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy'
  description: |-
    In Example 2, information is returned for a single Teams recording policy: the policy with the Identity ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy -Filter 'Tag:*'
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 3 returns information about all the Teams recording policies configured at the per-user scope.
    To do this, the command uses the Filter parameter and the filter value "Tag:\*"; that filter value limits the returned data to policies that have an Identity that begins with the string value "Tag:".
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Enables you to use wildcards when retrieving one or more Teams recording policies.
    For example, to return all the policies configured at the per-user scope, use this syntax:

    -Filter "Tag:\*"

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="XdsIdentity" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    Unique identifier of the Teams recording policy to be retrieved.
    To return the global policy, use this syntax:

    -Identity "Global"

    To return a policy configured at the per-user scope, use syntax like this:

    -Identity "ContosoPartnerComplianceRecordingPolicy"

    You cannot use wildcard characters when specifying the Identity.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LocalStore
  description: |+
    This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Tenant
  description: |+
    Globally unique identifier (GUID) of the tenant account whose Teams recording policies are being queried.
    For example:

    -Tenant "38aad667-af54-4397-aaa7-e94c79ec2308"

    You can return your tenant ID by running this command:

    Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID

    If you are using a remote session of Windows PowerShell and are connected only to Skype for Business Online you do not have to include the Tenant parameter.
    Instead, the tenant ID will automatically be filled in for you based on your connection information.
    The Tenant parameter is primarily for use in a hybrid deployment.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""

  Teams recording policies are used in automatic policy-based recording scenarios.
  When Microsoft Teams users participate in meetings or make or receive calls, the policy-based recording applications i.e. bots associated with the user's Teams recording policy are invited into the call or meeting to record audio, video and video-based screen sharing activity.

  Note that if neither the Identity nor the Filter parameters are specified, then Get-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy returns all the Teams recording policies configured for use in the tenant.

  Note that simply assigning a Teams recording policy to a Microsoft Teams user will not activate automatic policy-based recording for all Microsoft Teams calls and meetings that the user participates in.
  Among other things, you will need to create an application instance of a policy-based recording application i.e. a bot in your tenant and will then need to assign an appropriate policy to the user.

  Please work with your Microsoft certified policy-based recording application provider to obtain an instance of their recording application.
  Please refer to the documentation of the CsOnlineApplicationInstance cmdlets for information on how to create an application instance of a policy-based recording application.

  Assigning your Microsoft Teams users a Teams recording policy activates automatic policy-based recording for all new Microsoft Teams calls and meetings that the users participate in.
  The system will load the recording application and join it to appropriate calls and meetings in order for it to enforce compliance with the administrative set policy.
  Existing calls and meetings are unaffected.
