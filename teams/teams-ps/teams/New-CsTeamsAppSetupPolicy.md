# New-CsTeamsAppSetupPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
**NOTE**: The existence of this cmdlet is being documented for completeness, but do not use this cmdlet. We require that all creation and modification of app setup polices (not including the assignment or removal of policies from users) happens in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center to ensure that the policy matches your expectations for the end user experience.

As an admin, you can use app setup policies to customize Microsoft Teams to highlight the apps that are most important for your users. You choose the apps to pin and set the order that they appear. App setup policies let you showcase apps that users in your organization need, including ones built by third parties or by developers in your organization. You can also use app setup policies to manage how built-in features appear.

Apps are pinned to the app bar. This is the bar on the side of the Teams desktop client and at the bottom of the Teams mobile clients (iOS and Android).  Learn more about the App Setup Policies: <https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-app-setup-policies>.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
New-CsTeamsAppSetupPolicy -Identity (Get-Date -Format FileDateTimeUniversal)
```
Create a new TeamsAppSetupPolicy, if no parameters are specified, the Global Policy configuration is used by default.

### Example 2

```powershell
New-CsTeamsAppSetupPolicy -Identity (Get-Date -Format FileDateTimeUniversal) -AllowSideLoading $true -AllowUserPinning $true 
```
Create a new TeamsAppSetupPolicy. Users can upload a custom app package in the Teams app because AllowSideLoading is set as True, and existing app pins can be added to the list of pinned apps because AllowUserPinning is set as True.

### Example 3

```powershell
# Set ActivityApp, ChatApp, TeamsApp as PinnedAppBarApps
$ActivityApp = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Teams.Policy.Administration.Cmdlets.Core.PinnedApp -Property @{Id="14d6962d-6eeb-4f48-8890-de55454bb136"}
$ChatApp = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Teams.Policy.Administration.Cmdlets.Core.PinnedApp -Property @{Id="86fcd49b-61a2-4701-b771-54728cd291fb"}
$TeamsApp = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Teams.Policy.Administration.Cmdlets.Core.PinnedApp -Property @{Id="2a84919f-59d8-4441-a975-2a8c2643b741"}
$PinnedAppBarApps = @($ActivityApp,$ChatApp,$TeamsApp)

# Settings to pin these apps to the app bar in Teams client.
New-CsTeamsAppSetupPolicy -Identity (Get-Date -Format FileDateTimeUniversal) -AllowUserPinning $true -PinnedAppBarApps $PinnedAppBarApps
```
Create a new TeamsAppSetupPolicy and pin ActivityApp, ChatApp, TeamsApp apps to the app bar in Teams client by setting these apps as PinnedAppBarApps.

### Example 4

```powershell
# Set VivaConnectionsApp as PinnedMessageBarApps
$VivaConnectionsApp = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Teams.Policy.Administration.Cmdlets.Core.PinnedMessageBarApp -Property @{Id="d2c6f111-ffad-42a0-b65e-ee00425598aa"}
$PinnedMessageBarApps = @($VivaConnectionsApp)
# Settings to pin these apps to the messaging extension in Teams client.
Set-CsTeamsAppSetupPolicy -Identity (Get-Date -Format FileDateTimeUniversal) -AllowUserPinning $true -PinnedMessageBarApps $PinnedMessageBarApps
```
Create a new TeamsAppSetupPolicy and pin VivaConnections app to the messaging extension in Teams client by setting these apps as PinnedMessageBarApps.

### Example 5

```powershell
# Set VivaConnectionsApp as AppPresetList
$VivaConnectionsApp = New-Object -TypeName  Microsoft.Teams.Policy.Administration.Cmdlets.Core.AppPreset -Property @{Id="d2c6f111-ffad-42a0-b65e-ee00425598aa"}
$AppPresetList = @($VivaConnectionsApp)
# Settings to install these apps in your users' personal Teams environment
Set-CsTeamsAppSetupPolicy -Identity (Get-Date -Format FileDateTimeUniversal) -AllowSideLoading $true -AppPresetList $AppPresetList
```
Create a new TeamsAppSetupPolicy and install VivaConnections App in users' personal Teams environment by setting these apps as AppPresetList.
