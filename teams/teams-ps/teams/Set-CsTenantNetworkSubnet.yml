### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  As an admin, you can use the Teams PowerShell command, Set-CsTenantNetworkSubnet to define network subnets and assign them to network sites. Each internal subnet may only be associated with one site. The organization's network subnet is used for Location-Based Routing.

examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsTenantNetworkSubnet -Identity "192.168.0.1" -MaskBits "24" -NetworkSiteID "site1"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 set the network subnet '192.168.0.1'. The subnet is in IPv4 format, and the subnet is assigned to network site 'site1'. The maskbits is set to 24.

    IPv4 format subnet accepts maskbits from 0 to 32 inclusive.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-CsTenantNetworkSubnet -Identity "2001:4898:e8:25:844e:926f:85ad:dd8e" -MaskBits "120" -NetworkSiteID "site1" -Description "Subnet 2001:4898:e8:25:844e:926f:85ad:dd8e"
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 2 set the network subnet '2001:4898:e8:25:844e:926f:85ad:dd8e' with description 'Subnet 2001:4898:e8:25:844e:926f:85ad:dd8e'. The subnet is in IPv6 format, and the subnet is assigned to network site 'site1'. The maskbits is set to 120.

    IPv6 format subnet accepts maskbits from 0 to 128 inclusive.

description: |-
  IP subnets at the location where Teams endpoints can connect to the network must be defined and associated to a defined network in order to enforce toll bypass. Multiple subnets may be associated with the same network site, but multiple sites may not be associated with a same subnet. This association of subnets enables Location-Based Routing to locate the endpoints geographically to determine if a given PSTN call should be allowed. Both IPv4 and IPv6 subnets are supported. When determining if a Teams endpoint is located at a site an IPv6 address will be checked for a match first.
