# Remove-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Deletes an existing Teams voice applications policy.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy [-Identity] <String> [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
TeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy is used for Supervisor Delegated Administration which allows tenant admins to permit certain users to make changes to auto attendant and call queue configurations. 


## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
Remove-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy -Identity "SDA-Allow-All"
```
The command shown in Example 1 deletes the Teams voice applications policy SDA-Allow-All.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
Get-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy -Filter "tag:*" | Remove-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy
```
In Example 2, all Teams voice applications policies configured at the per-user scope are removed. To do this, the command first calls the Get-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy cmdlet along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "tag:*" limits the returned data to Teams voice applications policies configured at the per-user scope. Those per-user policies are then piped to and removed by the Remove-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy cmdlet.
