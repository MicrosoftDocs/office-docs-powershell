# Remove-CsTeamsAppPermissionPolicy

## SYNOPSIS

**NOTE**: You can use this cmdlet to remove a specific custom policy from a user. We require that all creation and modification of app permission polices (not including the assignment or removal of policies from users) happens in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center to ensure that the policy matches your expectations for the end user experience. This cmdlet is not supported for tenants that migrated to app centric management feature as it replaced permission policies. While the cmdlet may succeed, the changes aren't applied to the tenant.

As an admin, you can use app permission policies to allow or block apps for your users. Learn more about the app permission policies at <https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-permission-policies> and about app centric management at <https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/app-centric-management>.

This cmdlet allows you to remove app permission policies that have been created within your organization. If you run `Remove-CsTeamsAppPermissionPolicy` on the Global policy, it will be reset to the defaults provided for new organizations.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CsTeamsAppSetupPolicy [-Tenant <Guid>] [-Identity] <XdsIdentity> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
**NOTE**: You can use this cmdlet to remove a specific custom policy from a user.

This cmdlet allows you to remove app permission policies that have been created within your organization. If you run Remove-CsTeamsAppPermissionPolicy on the Global policy, it will be reset to the defaults provided for new organizations.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-CsTeamsAppPermissionPolicy -Identity SalesPolicy
```

Deletes a custom policy that has already been created in the organization.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Unique identifier for the policy to be removed.
To "remove" the global policy, use the following syntax: `-Identity global`.

You cannot use wildcards when specifying a policy Identity.
