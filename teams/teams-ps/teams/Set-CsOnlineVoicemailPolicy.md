## DESCRIPTION
Cloud Voicemail service provides organizations with voicemail deposit capabilities for Phone System implementation.

By default, users enabled for Phone System will be enabled for Cloud Voicemail. The Online Voicemail policy controls whether or not voicemail transcription, profanity masking for the voicemail transcriptions, translation for the voicemail transcriptions, and editing call answer rule settings are enabled for a user. The policies also specify the voicemail maximum recording length for a user and the primary and secondary voicemail system prompt languages. 

- Voicemail transcription is enabled by default
- Transcription profanity masking is disabled by default
- Transcription translation is enabled by default
- Editing call answer rule settings is enabled by default
- Voicemail maximum recording length is set to 5 minutes by default
- Primary and secondary system prompt languages are set to null by default and the user's voicemail language setting is used
 
Tenant admin would be able to create a customized online voicemail policy to match the organization's requirements.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- Example 1 --------------------------
```
Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -Identity "CustomOnlineVoicemailPolicy" -MaximumRecordingLength ([TimeSpan]::FromSeconds(60))
```

The command shown in Example 1 changes the MaximumRecordingLength to 60 seconds for the per-user online voicemail policy CustomOnlineVoicemailPolicy.

### -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
```
Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -EnableTranscriptionProfanityMasking $false
```

The command shown in Example 2 changes the EnableTranscriptionProfanityMasking to false for tenant level global online voicemail policy when calling without Identity parameter.
