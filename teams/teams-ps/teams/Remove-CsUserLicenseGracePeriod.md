# Remove-CsUserLicenseGracePeriod

## SYNOPSIS

The `CsUserLicenseGracePeriod` cmdlet expedites the delicensing operation for the assigned plan(s) of a user/resource account by removing the grace period, permanently deleting the assigned plan(s).
Note that this cmdlet is to be used only by tenants with license resiliency enabled. (License resiliency is currently under private preview and not available for everyone.)

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Remove-CsUserLicenseGracePeriod
[-Identity] <String>
[-Capability <String>]
[-Force]
[-WhatIf]
[-Confirm]
[<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The command removes the grace period of the assigned plan(s) against the specified user(s)/resource account(s), permanently deleting the plan(s).
Permanently deletes all/specified plans belonging to the user, which has a grace period assosciated with it.
Assigned plans with no subsequent grace period will see no change.

If you want to verify the grace period of any assigned plan against a user, you can return that information by using this command:

`Get-CsOnlineUser -Identity bf19b7db-6960-41e5-a139-2aa373474354`

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
Remove-CsUserLicenseGracePeriod -Identity bf19b7db-6960-41e5-a139-2aa373474354
```

In Example 1, the command removes the grace period of all assigned plan(s) against the specified user ID, marking the subsequent assigned plan(s) as deleted. Assigned plans with no subsequent grace period will see no change.

### Example 2

```powershell
Remove-CsUserLicenseGracePeriod -Identity bf19b7db-6960-41e5-a139-2aa373474354 -Capability 'MCOEV,MCOMEETADD'
```

In Example 2, the capability specified refers to plans assigned to the user(s) under AssignedPlans. The command removes the grace period of the specified assigned plans, marking the subsequent plan(s) as deleted.
