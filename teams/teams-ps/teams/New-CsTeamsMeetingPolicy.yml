  code: |-
    New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity SalesMeetingPolicy -AllowTranscription $True
  description: |-
    The command shown in Example 1 uses the New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy cmdlet to create a new meeting policy with the Identity SalesMeetingPolicy.
    This policy will use all the default values for a meeting policy except one: AllowTranscription; in this example, meetings for users with this policy can include real time or post meeting captions and transcriptions.

    - OneDriveForBusiness

    Note: The change of storing Teams meeting recordings from Classic Stream to OneDrive and SharePoint (ODSP) has been completed as of August 30th, 2021. All recordings are now stored in ODSP. This change overrides the RecordingStorageMode parameter, and modifying the setting in PowerShell no longer has any impact.

Instead, the tenant ID will automatically be filled in for you based on your connection information. The Tenant parameter is primarily for use in a hybrid deployment.
