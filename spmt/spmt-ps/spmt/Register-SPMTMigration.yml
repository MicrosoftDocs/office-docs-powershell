    Note: If you have a registered SPMT migration session already, the Force parameter will register a new session anyway.The Force parameter performs the function of Stop-SMPTMigration and Unregister-SPMTMigration together.
    If you have never run "Register-SPMTMigration", with or without the Force parameter, a new session will be created.

    If you have an active migration and didn't use the Force parameter, you need to run Stop-SPMTMigration, and then run Unregister-SPMTMigration to unregister the exiting migration session first.
